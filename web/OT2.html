 <journalaccount>
  <block><span>
   This edition of THE OLD TESTAMENT increases readability by modernizing
   the page layout. The text is formatted into standard paragraphs and white
   space and other modern tools (section headers, bullet lists, etc.) are
   used to help with readability. Chapter and verse references are visually
   subdued so as to not distract from the message.
  </span></block>

  <block><span>
   This edition uses the text from the Inspired Version, or Joseph Smith
   Translation (JST), of the Bible, while using King James Version verse
   numbers for convenience. Significant changes in wording between the KJV
   text and the JST text are indicated by an
   </span><under><span>underline</span></under><span>, and the KJV text appears in the margin.
   Significant additions not found in the KJV text are indicated by a
   </span><dunder><span>dashed underline</span></dunder><span>.
  </span></block>

  <block><span>
   Many text differences between the JST and the KJV have little to no impact
   on the meaning, such as:

   In the Hebrew text, the name of God is יהוה ,often transliterated as YHVH or YHWH. In the KJV, that name is represented as LORD or GOD, in all capitals. The JST did not use this method, so textual additions
   do not have these names in all capitals even though surrounding usage would indicate they were
   appropriate. There are two significant variations that are used frequently in the Old Testament:

   This version has minimally updated the archaic English of the original. The -eth verb ending (causeth, doeth,
   etc.) has been updated to modern verb endings (causes, does, etc.). Archaic personal pronouns before a
   vowel sound (mine arm) have also been updated (my arm). When there wasn't a direct modern equivalent,
   the archaic word was retained. For example, thou lacks a modern equivalent. You is ambiguous and can
   mean one or many - whereas thou is one person only. Thou and its archaic verb endings have been retained.

 <book><span>1 SAMUEL</span></book>
 <chapter>1</chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim-Zophim, of mount
  Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son
  of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, and Ephrathite;
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>and he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the
  name of the other Peninnah; and Peninnah had children, but
  Hannah had no children.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to
  sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of
  Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah
  his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions;
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>but unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah;
  but the LORD had shut up her womb.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret,
  because the LORD had shut up her womb.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of
  the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not
  eat.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>Then said Elkanah her husband to her:</span><quote><span>
   Hannah, why weepest thou? And why eatest thou not? And why is thy
   heart grieved? Am not I better to thee than ten sons?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <heading><span>
  Hannah prays for a son
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after
  they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of
  the temple of the LORD.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD,
  and wept sore.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And she vowed a vow, and said:</span><quote><span>
   O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of
   thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid,
   but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man-child, then I will give
   him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no
   razor come upon his head.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD,
  that Eli marked her mouth.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but
  her voice was not heard; therefore Eli thought she had been
  drunken.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And Eli said unto her:</span><quote><span>
   How long wilt thou be drunken? Put away thy wine from thee.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And Hannah answered and said:</span><quote><span>
   No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit; I have drunk
   neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before
   the LORD.
   </span><verse>16</verse><span>Count not thine handmaid for
   a daughter of Belial; for out of the abundance of my complaint and
   grief have I spoken hitherto.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>And Eli answered and said:</span><quote><span>
   Go in peace; and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that
   thou hast asked of him.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>And she said:</span><quote><span>
   Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no
  more sad.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  The birth of Samuel
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>And they rose up in the morning early, and worshiped before the
  LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah; and
  Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about
  after
  Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name
  Samuel, saying, "Because I have asked him of the LORD."
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  Hannah dedicates Samuel
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto
  the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband:</span><quote><span>
   I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring
   him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide forever.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>And Elkanah her husband said unto her:</span><quote><span>
   Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only
   the LORD establish his word.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>And when she had weaned him, she took
  him up with her, with three bullocks, and one
  </span><superscript><span>a</span></superscript>
  <note>
   <superscript><span>a</span></superscript><span>36 lb or 16 kg</span></note><span>ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine,
   and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh; and the
   child was young.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>And they slew a
  bullock, and brought the child to Eli.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>And she said:
  </span><quote><span>
   O my lord, as thy soul liveth, my Lord, I am the woman that stood
   by thee here, praying unto the LORD.
   </span><verse>27</verse><span>For this child I prayed; and the LORD
   hath given me my petition which I asked of him;
   </span><verse>28</verse><span>therefore also I have lent him to the
   LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And he worshiped the LORD there.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  Hannah's prayer
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>2
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And Hannah prayed, and said:</span><quote>
   <block><span>
    My heart rejoices in the LORD, mine horn is exalted in the LORD;
    my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoiced in thy
    salvation.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>2</verse><span>There is none holy as the LORD; for there is none besides thee;
    neither is there any rock like our God.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>3</verse><span>Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out
    of your mouth; for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him
    actions are weighed.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>4</verse><span>The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled
    are girded with strength.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>5</verse><span>They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and
    they that were hungry ceased; so that the barren hath borne
    seven; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>6</verse><span>The LORD killeth, and maketh alive; he bringeth down to the
    grave, and bringeth up.
    </span><verse>7</verse><span>The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich; he bringeth low, and
    lifteth up.
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the
    beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make
    them inherit the throne of glory; for the pillars of the earth
    are the LORD's, and he hath set the world upon them.
    </span><verse>9</verse><span>He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be
    silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>10</verse><span>The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of
    heaven shall he thunder upon them; the LORD shall judge the ends
    of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king, and
    exalt the horn of his anointed.</span></block>

  </quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did
  minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  Eli's wicked sons
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the
  LORD.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And the priest's custom with the people was, that, when any man
  offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh
  was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot;
  all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself.
  So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came
  thither.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>Also before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and
  said to the man that sacrificed, "Give flesh to roast for the
  priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw."
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And if any man said unto him, "Let them not fail to burn the
  fat presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth;" then
  he would answer him, "Nay; but thou shalt give it me now; and if
  not, I will take it by force."
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the
  LORD; for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded
  with a linen ephod.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to
  him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to
  offer the yearly sacrifice.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said:</span><quote><span>
   The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent
   to the LORD.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And they went unto their own home.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>And
  the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare three
  sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all
  Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the
  door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>And he said unto them:</span><quote><span>
   Why do ye such things? For I hear of your evil dealings by all
   this people.
   </span><verse>24</verse><span>Nay, my sons; for it is
   no good report that I hear; ye make the LORD's people to
   transgress.
   </span><verse>25</verse><span>If one man sin against
   another, the judge shall judge him; but if a man sin against the
   LORD, who shall entreat for him?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  Notwithstanding, they hearkened not unto the voice of their
  father, because the LORD would slay them.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>26</verse><span>And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favor both with the
  LORD, and also with men.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  Prophecy against the house of Eli
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>27</verse><span>And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>
    Thus saith the LORD: Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy
    father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?
    </span><verse>28</verse><span>And did I choose him out of all the
    tribes of Israel to be my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to
    burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? And did I give unto the
    house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children
    of Israel?
    </span><verse>29</verse><span>Wherefore kick ye at my
    sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded in my
    habitation; and honorest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat
    with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>30</verse><span>Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith: I said indeed that thy
    house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me
    forever; but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them
    that honor me I will honor, and they that despise me shall be
    lightly esteemed.
    </span><verse>31</verse><span>Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the
    arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in
    thine house.
    </span><verse>32</verse><span>And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth
    which God shall give Israel; and there shall not be an old man in thine house forever.
    </span><verse>33</verse><span>And the man of thine, whom I shall
    not cut off from mine altar, shall be to consume thine eyes, and
    to grieve thine heart; and all the increase of thine house shall
    die in the flower of their age.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>34</verse><span>And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy
    two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both
    of them.
    </span><verse>35</verse><span>And I will rise me up a faithful priest, that shall do
    according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind; and I
    will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine
    anointed forever.
    </span><verse>36</verse><span>And it shall come to pass, that everyone that is left in thine
    house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a
    morsel of bread, and shall say, "Put me, I pray thee, into one
    of the priests' offices, that I may eat a piece of bread."</span></block>

 <heading><span>
  The LORD calls Samuel
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>3
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And
  the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no
  open vision.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his
  place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see;
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>and ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD,
  where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>That the LORD called Samuel; and he answered, "Here am I."
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And he ran unto Eli, and said, "Here am I; for thou calledst
  me." And he said, "I called not; lie down again." And he went
  and lay down.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And the LORD called yet again, "Samuel." And Samuel arose and
  went to Eli, and said, "Here am I; for thou didst call me." And
  he answered, "I called not, my son; lie down again."
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of
  the LORD ye revealed unto him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose
  and went to Eli, and said, "Here am I; for thou didst call me."
  And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>Therefore Eli said unto Samuel:</span><quote><span>
   Go, lie down; and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt
   say, "Speak, Lord; for thy servant heareth."
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  So Samuel went and lay down in his place.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And the LORD came, and stood, and
  called as at other times, "Samuel, Samuel." Then Samuel answered,
  "Speak; for thy servant heareth."
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And
  the LORD said to Samuel:
  </span><quote><span>
   Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of
   everyone that heareth it shall tingle.
   </span><verse>12</verse><span>In that day I will perform against Eli
   all things which I have spoken concerning his house; when I begin,
   I will also make an end.
   </span><verse>13</verse><span>For I have
   told him that I will judge his house forever for the iniquity
   which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he
   restrained them not.
   </span><verse>14</verse><span>And therefore I
   have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house
   shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering forever.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the
  house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>Then Eli called Samuel, and said, "Samuel, my son." And he
  answered, "Here am I."
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And he said:</span><quote><span>
   What is the thing that the LORD hath said unto thee? I pray thee
   hide it not from me; God do so to thee, and more also, if thou
   hide anything from me of all the things that he said unto thee.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And
  he said:
  </span><quote><span>It is the LORD; let him do what seemeth him good.</span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of
  his words fall to the ground.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-Sheba knew that Samuel was
  established to be a prophet of the LORD.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh; for the LORD revealed
  himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.

  <verse>1</verse><span>And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out
  against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Ebenezer;
  and the Philistines pitched in Aphek.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel; and
  when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the
  Philistines; and they slew of the army in the field about four
  thousand men.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of
  Israel said:</span><quote><span>
   Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us today before the Philistines?
   Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of Shiloh
   unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the
   hand of our enemies.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence
  the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth
  between the cherubim; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and
  Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the
  camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth
  rang again.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they
  said:</span><quote><span>
   What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the
   Hebrews?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And they understood that the ark of the LORD was come into the
  camp.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And the Philistines were afraid;
  for they said, "God is come into the camp." And they said:
  </span><quote><span>
   Woe unto us! For there hath not been such a thing heretofore.
   </span><verse>8</verse><span>Woe unto us! Who shall deliver us out
   of the hand of these mighty Gods? These are the Gods that smote
   the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness.
   </span><verse>9</verse><span>Be strong, and quit yourselves like
   men. O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews,
   as they have been to you; quit yourselves like men, and fight.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they
  fled every man into his tent; and there was very great
  slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni
  and Phinehas, were slain.

  The death of Eli
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to
  Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon
  his head.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside
  watching; for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when
  the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, "What
  meaneth the noise of this tumult?" And the man came in hastily,
  and told Eli.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim,
  that he could not see.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And the man said unto Eli, "I am he that came out of the army,
  and I fled today out of the army." And he said, "What is there
  done, my son?"
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>And the messenger answered and said:</span><quote><span>
   Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a
   great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni
   and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.
  </span></quote>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God,
  that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate,
  and his neck brake, and he died; for he was an old man, and
  heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>And his daughter-in-law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near
  to be delivered; and when she heard the tidings that the ark of
  God was taken, and that her father-in-law and her husband were
  dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came upon
  her.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And about the time of her death the women that stood by her
  said unto her, "Fear not; for thou hast borne a son." But she
  answered not, neither did she regard it.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>And she named the child Ichabod, saying, "The glory is departed
  from Israel; because the ark of God was taken, and because of
  her father-in-law and her husband.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>And she said:</span><quote><span>
   The glory is departed from Israel; for the ark of God is taken.

  The ark among the Philistines
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>5
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from
  Ebenezer unto Ashdod.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>When the
  Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the house of
  Dagon, and set it by Dagon.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And when
  they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon was fallen
  upon his face to the earth before the ark of the LORD. And they
  took Dagon, and set him in his place again.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And when they arose early on the morrow
  morning, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground
  before the ark of the LORD; and the head of Dagon and both the
  palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold; only the stump
  of Dagon was left to him.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>Therefore
  neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon's
  house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he
  destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, even Ashdod and the
  coasts thereof.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said:</span><quote><span>
   The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us; for his hand
   is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our god.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the
  Philistines unto them, and said: What shall we do with the ark
  of the God of Israel?
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  And they answered:
  </span><quote><span>
   Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about unto Gath.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about thither.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>And it was so, that, after they had
  carried it about, the hand of the LORD was against the city with a
  very great destruction; and he smote the men of the city, both
  small and great, and they had emerods in their secret parts.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>Therefore they sent the ark of God to
  Ekron. And it came to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that
  the Ekronites cried out, saying:
  </span><quote><span>
   They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to
   slay us and our people.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the
  Philistines, and said:</span><quote><span>
   Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to his
   own place, that it slay us not, and our people.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  For there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the
  hand of God was very heavy there.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And
  the men that died not were smitten with the emerods; and the cry
  of the city went up to heaven.

  The ark returned to Israel
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>6
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines
  seven months.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners,
  saying:</span><quote><span>
   What shall we do to the ark of the LORD? Tell us wherewith we
   shall send it to his place.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>And they said:</span><quote><span>
   If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty;
   but in any wise return him a trespass offering; then ye shall be
   healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed
   from you.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Then said they:</span><quote><span>
   What shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  They answered:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>
    Five golden emerods, and five golden mice, according to the number
    of the lords of the Philistines; for one plague was on you all,
    and on your lords.
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>Wherefore ye shall
    make images of your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the
    land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel; peradventure
    he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and
    from off your land.
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>Wherefore then do
    ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their
    hearts? When he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not
    let the people go, and they departed?
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>7</verse><span>Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milch kine, on
    which there hath come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart, and
    bring their calves home from them;
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>and take the ark of the LORD, and lay it upon the cart; and put
    the jewels of gold, which ye return him for a trespass offering,
    in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away, that it may
    go.
    </span><verse>9</verse><span>And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to
    Beth-Shemesh, then he hath done us this great evil; but if not,
    then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us; it was
    a chance that happened to us.</span></block>

  </quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to
  the cart, and shut up their calves at home.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And they laid the ark of the LORD upon the cart, and the coffer
  with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And the kine took the straight way to the way of Beth-Shemesh,
  and went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not
  aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the
  Philistines went after them unto the border of
  Beth-Shemesh.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>And they of Beth-Shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in
  the valley; and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and
  rejoiced to see it.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Beth-Shemite, and
  stood there, where there was a great stone; and they clave the
  wood of the cart, and offered the kine a burnt offering unto the
  LORD.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the coffer
  that was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put them
  on the great stone; and the men of Beth-Shemesh offered burnt
  offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the LORD.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they
  returned to Ekron the same day.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>And these are the golden emerods which the Philistines returned
  for a trespass offering unto the LORD; for Ashdod one, for Gaza
  one, for Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>and the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities
  of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fenced
  cities, and of country villages, even unto the great stone of
  Abel, whereon they set down the ark of the LORD; which stone
  remaineth unto this day in the field of Joshua, the
  Beth-Shemite.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>And he smote the men of Beth-Shemesh, because they had looked
  into the ark of the LORD, even he smote of the people fifty
  thousand and threescore and ten men; and the people lamented,
  because the LORD had smitten many of the people with a great
  slaughter.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And the men of Beth-Shemesh said:</span><quote><span>Who is able to stand before this holy LORD God? And to whom
  shall he go up from us?</span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjath-Jearim,
  saying:</span><quote><span>
   The Philistines have brought again the ark of the LORD; come ye
   down, and fetch it up to you.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <chapter>7
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And the men of Kirjath-Jearim came, and fetched up the ark of
  the LORD, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill,
  and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjath-Jearim,
  that the time was long; for it was twenty years; and all the
  house of Israel lamented after the LORD.

  Samuel subdues the Philistines
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying:</span><quote><span>
   If ye do return unto the LORD with all your hearts, then put away
   the strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your
   hearts unto the LORD, and serve him only; and he will deliver you
   out of the hand of the Philistines.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth,
  and served the LORD only.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>And Samuel said, "Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray
  for you unto the LORD."
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and
  poured it out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and said
  there, "We have sinned against the LORD." And Samuel judged the
  children of Israel in Mizpeh.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were
  gathered together to Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines went
  up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard it,
  they were afraid of the Philistines.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>And the children of Israel said to Samuel:</span><quote><span>
   Cease not to cry unto the LORD our God for us, that he will save
   us out of the hand of the Philistines.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>And Samuel took a suckling lamb, and offered it for a burnt
  offering wholly unto the LORD; and Samuel cried unto the LORD
  for Israel; and the LORD heard him.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the
  Philistines drew near to battle against Israel; but the LORD
  thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines,
  and discomfited them; and they were smitten before Israel.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the
  Philistines, and smote them until they came under Beth-
  Car.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen,
  and called the name of it Ebenezer, saying:
  </span><quote><span>"Hitherto hath the
  LORD helped us."</span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the
  coast of Israel; and the hand of the LORD was against the
  Philistines all the days of Samuel.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were
  restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the coasts
  thereof did Israel deliver out of the hands of the Philistines.
  And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And he went from year to year in circuit to Beth-El, and
  Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And his return was to Ramah; for there was his house; and there
  he judged Israel; and there he built an altar unto the
  LORD.

 <chapter>8
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons
  judges over Israel.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his
  second, Abiah; they were judges in Beer-Sheba.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after
  lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and
  came to Samuel unto Ramah,
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>and said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways; now make
   us a king to judge us like all the nations.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, "Give us a
  king to judge us." And Samuel prayed unto the LORD.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And the LORD said unto Samuel:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>
    Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto
    thee; for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me,
    that I should not reign over them.
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>According to all the works which they have done since the day
    that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day,
    wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do
    they also unto thee.
    </span><verse>9</verse><span>Now therefore hearken unto their voice; howbeit yet protest
    solemnly unto them, and show them the manner of the king that
    shall reign over them.</span></block>

  </quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that
  asked of him a king.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And he said:</span><quote><span>
   This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He
   will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his
   chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his
   chariots.
   </span><verse>12</verse><span>And he will appoint him
   captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and will set
   them to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his
   instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots.
   </span><verse>13</verse><span>And he will take your daughters to be
   confectioneries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers.
   </span><verse>14</verse><span>And he will take your fields, and your
   vineyards, and your olive yards, even the best of them, and give
   them to his servants.
   </span><verse>15</verse><span>And he will take
   the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his
   officers, and to his servants.
   </span><verse>16</verse><span>And he
   will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your
   goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work.
   </span><verse>17</verse><span>He will take the tenth of your sheep;
   and ye shall be his servants.
   </span><verse>18</verse><span>And ye
   shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have
   chosen you; and the LORD will not hear you in that day.
  </span></quote>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel;

   Nay; but we will have a king over us;

   nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and

  <verse>1</verse><span>Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son

  Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a choice young man, and
  a goodly; and there was not among the children of Israel a
  goodlier person than he; from his shoulders and upward he was
  higher than any of the people.

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>And the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost. And Kish said to
  Saul his son, "Take now one of the servants with thee, and

  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the
  land of Shalisha, but they found them not; then they passed
  through the land of Shalim, and there they were not; and he
  passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them
  not.

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his
  servant that was with him:, "Come, and let us return; lest my

  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And he said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>Then said Saul to his servant:</span><quote><span>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>And they answered them and said:</span><quote><span>

   </span><verse>13</verse><span>as soon as ye be come into
   the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the
   high place to eat; for the people will not eat until he come,
   because he doth bless the sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that

   I am the seer; go up before me unto the high place; for ye shall

   thee all that is in thine heart.
   </span><verse>20</verse><span>And
   as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind

  <verse>22</verse><span>And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the

  <verse>20</verse><span>And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come

  Kish was taken; and when they sought him, he could not be found.

  yet come thither. And the LORD answered:</span><quote><span>
   Behold, he hath hid himself among the stuff.

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>And they ran and fetched him thence; and when he stood among

   our place, and will not go up unto them.
   </span><verse>10</verse><span>But if they say thus, "Come up unto

  <verse>11</verse><span>And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the

   Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his

  And Jonathan said unto his armor-bearer:
  </span><quote><span>
   Come up after me; for the LORD hath delivered them into the hand

  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and
  his armor-bearer after him; and they fell before Jonathan; and
  his armor-bearer slew after him.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armor-bearer
  made, was about twenty men, within as it were a half acre of
  land, which a yoke of oxen might plough.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among
  all the people; the garrison, and the spoilers, they also
  trembled, and the earth quaked; so it was a very great
  trembling.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and,
  behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down
  one another.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>Then said Saul unto the people that were with him:</span><quote><span>
   Number now, and see who is gone from us.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armor-bearer
  were not there.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>And Saul said unto Ahiah: Bring hither the ark of God.
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And it came to pass, while Saul talked
  unto the priest, that the noise that was in the host of the
  Philistines went on and increased; and Saul said unto the priest:
  </span><quote><span>
   Withdraw thine hand.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled
  themselves, and they came to the battle; and, behold, every
  man's sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great
  discomfiture.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>Moreover, the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before
  that time, which went up with them into the camp from the
  country round about, even they also turned to be with the
  Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in
  mount Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even
  they also followed hard after them in the battle.
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>So the LORD saved Israel that day; and the battle passed over
  unto Beth-Aven.

 <heading><span>
  Jonathan eats honey
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>And the men of Israel were distressed that day; for Saul had
  adjured the people, saying, "Cursed be the man that eateth any
  food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies." So
  none of the people tasted any food.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>25</verse><span>And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey
  upon the ground.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>And
  when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey
  dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth; for the people
  feared the oath.
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>But Jonathan heard
  not when his father charged the people with the oath; wherefore he
  put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it
  in a honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were
  enlightened.
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>Then answered one of the
  people, and said:
  </span><quote><span>
   Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying,
   "Cursed be the man that eateth any food this day."
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And the people were faint.
  </span><verse>29</verse><span>Then said
  Jonathan:
  </span><quote><span>
   My father hath troubled the land; see, I pray you, how mine eyes
   have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.
   </span><verse>30</verse><span>How much more, if haply the people had
   eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they found?
   For had their not been now a much greater slaughter among the
   Philistines?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>31</verse><span>And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to
  Aijalon; and the people were very faint.
  </span><verse>32</verse><span>And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen,
  and calves, and
  slew them on the ground; and the people did eat them with the
  blood.
  </span><verse>33</verse><span>Then they told Saul, saying:
  </span><quote><span>
   Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the
   blood.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And he said, "Ye have transgressed; roll a great stone unto me
  this day."
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>34</verse><span>And Saul said:</span><quote><span>
   Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, "Bring me
   hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them
   here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating with the
   blood."
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night,
  and slew them there.
  </span><verse>35</verse><span>And Saul built an
  altar unto the LORD; the same was the first altar that he built
  unto the LORD.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>36</verse><span>And Saul said:</span><quote><span>
   Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them
   until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>And they said, "Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee."</span></block>

 <block><span>Then said the priest, "Let us draw near hither unto God."</span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>37</verse><span>And Saul asked counsel of God:
  </span><quote><span>
   Shall I go down after the Philistines? Wilt thou deliver them into
   the hand of Israel?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  But he answered him not that day.
  </span><verse>38</verse><span>And
  Saul said:
  </span><quote><span>
   Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people; and know and see
   wherein this sin hath been this day.
   </span><verse>39</verse><span>For, as the LORD liveth, which saveth
   Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  But there was not a man among all the people that answered him.
  </span><verse>40</verse><span>Then said he unto all Israel:
  </span><quote><span>
   Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other
   side.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And the people said unto Saul, "Do what seemeth good unto thee."
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>41</verse><span>Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, "Give a
  perfect lot." And Saul and Jonathan were taken; but the people
  escaped.
  </span><verse>42</verse><span>And Saul said, "Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son." And
  Jonathan was taken.
  </span><verse>43</verse><span>Then Saul said to Jonathan, "Tell me what thou hast
  done."
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  And Jonathan told him, and said:
  </span><quote><span>
   I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in
   mine hand, and, lo, I must die.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>44</verse><span>And Saul answered, "God do so and more also; for thou shalt
  surely die, Jonathan."
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>45</verse><span>And the people said unto Saul:</span><quote><span>
   Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in
   Israel? God forbid; as the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair
   of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this
   day.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>46</verse><span>Then Saul went up from following the Philistines; and the
  Philistines went to their own place.
  </span><verse>47</verse><span>So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all
  his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the
  children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of
  Zobah, and against the Philistines; and whithersoever he turned
  himself, he vexed them.
  </span><verse>48</verse><span>And he
  gathered a host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel
  out of the hands of them that spoiled them.

 <block>
  <verse>49</verse><span>Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua;

  first-born Merab, and the name of the younger Michal;
  </span><verse>50</verse><span>and the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of
  Ahimaaz; and the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the
  son of Ner, Saul's uncle.
  </span><verse>51</verse><span>And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner
  was the son of Abiel.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>52</verse><span>And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of

 <chapter>15

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Samuel also said unto Saul:</span><quote><span>
   The LORD sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people, over
   Israel; now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of
   the LORD.
   </span><verse>2</verse><span>Thus saith the LORD of hosts:
   I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for
   him in the way, when he came up from Egypt.
   </span><verse>3</verse><span>Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly
   destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man
   and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in
  Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of
  Judah.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And Saul said unto the Kenites:</span><quote><span>
   Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy
   you with them; for ye showed kindness to all the children of
   Israel when they came up out of Egypt.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And Saul smote the Amalekites from
  Havilah until thou comest to Shur, that is over against Egypt.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>And he took Agag the king of the
  Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the
  edge of the sword.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>But Saul and the
  people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen,
  and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and
  would not utterly destroy them; but everything that was vile and
  refuse, that they destroyed utterly.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying:</span><quote>
   <verse>11</verse><under>
    <note><span>It repenteth me that I have</span></note><span>I have</span></under><span>
   set up Saul to be a king, and he repenteth not that he hath

 </block>

 <block><span>
  And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the LORD all night.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And when Samuel rose early to meet
  Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying:

   Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is

  <verse>13</verse><span>And Samuel came to Saul; and Saul said unto him:</span><quote><span>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>And Samuel said:</span><quote><span>

  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And Saul said:</span><quote><span>
   They have brought them from the Amalekites; for the people spared

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>Then Samuel said unto Saul:</span><quote><span>

 <block><span>
  And he said unto him, "Say on."
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And
  Samuel said:

   When thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not made the
   head of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed thee king over
   Israel?
   </span><verse>18</verse><span>And the LORD sent thee on a
   journey, and said, "Go and utterly destroy the sinners the
   Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed."
   </span><verse>19</verse><span>Wherefore then didst thou not obey the
   voice of the LORD, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in
   the sight of the LORD?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>And Saul said unto Samuel:</span><quote><span>
   Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way

   and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.
   </span><verse>21</verse><span>But the people took of the spoil,
   sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been
   utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God in Gilgal.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>And Samuel said:</span><quote><span>
   hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offering and sacrifices,
   as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better
   than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.
   </span><verse>23</verse><span>For rebellion is as the sin of
   witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because
   thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, he hath also rejected
   thee from being king.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>And Saul said unto Samuel:</span><quote><span>
   I have sinned; for I have transgressed the commandment of the

   </span><verse>25</verse><span>Now therefore, I pray thee,
   pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the

 <block>
  <verse>27</verse><span>And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the

  </span><verse>28</verse><span>And Samuel said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and
   hath given it to a neighbor of thine, that is better than thou.
   </span><verse>29</verse><span>And also the Strength of Israel will
   not lie nor repent; for he is not a man that he should repent.

 <block>
  <verse>30</verse><span>Then he said:</span><quote><span>
   I have sinned; yet honor me now, I pray thee, before the elders of

  <verse>31</verse><span>So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshiped the LORD.

   Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature;

  <verse>8</verse><span>And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto
  them:</span><quote><span>
   Why are ye come out to set your battle in array? Am not I a
   Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? Choose you a man for you, and
   let him come down to me.
   </span><verse>9</verse><span>If he be able
   to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants;
   but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our
   servants, and serve us.

  <verse>10</verse><span>And the Philistine said:</span><quote><span>
   I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may

  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine,
  they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehem-Judah,
  whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons; and the man went
  among men for an old man in the days of Saul.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to
  the battle; and the names of his three sons that went to the
  battle were Eliab the first-born, and next unto him
  Abinadab, and the third Shammah.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And
  David was the youngest; and the three eldest followed Saul.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>But David went and returned from Saul
  to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented
  himself forty days.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>And Jesse said unto David his son:</span><quote><span>
   Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corn, and these
   ten loaves, and run to the camp to thy brethren;
   </span><verse>18</verse><span>and carry these ten cheeses unto the
   captain of their thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and
   take their pledge.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the
  valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with
  a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he
  came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight,
  and shouted for the battle.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array,
  army against army.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the
  carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his
  brethren.
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>And as he talked with them behold, there came up the champion,
  the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of
  the Philistines, and spake according to the same words; and
  David heard them.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from
  him, and were sore afraid.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>And the men of Israel said:</span><quote><span>
   Have ye seen this man that is come up? Surely to defy Israel is he
   come up; and it shall be that the man who killeth him, the king
   will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter,
   and make his father's house free in Israel.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>26</verse><span>And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying:</span><quote><span>
   What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and
   taketh away the reproach from Israel? For who is this
   uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the
   living God?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>27</verse><span>And the people answered him after this manner, saying, "So
  shall it be done to the man that killeth him."
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men;
  and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said:</span><quote><span>
   Why camest thou down hither? And with whom hast thou left those
   few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride and the naughtiness
   of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the
   battle.
  </span></quote>

 <block>
  <verse>29</verse><span>And David said, "What have I now done? Is there not a

 <block>
  <verse>30</verse><span>And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the same
  manner; and the people answered him again after the former
  manner.
  </span><verse>31</verse><span>And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed
  them before Saul; and he sent for him.
  </span><verse>32</verse><span>And David said to Saul:</span><quote><span>
   Let no man's heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and
   fight with this Philistine.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>33</verse><span>And Saul said to David:</span><quote><span>
   Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him;
   for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>34</verse><span>And David said unto Saul:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>
    Thy servant kept his father's sheep, and there came a lion, and a
    bear, and took a lamb out of the flock;
    </span><verse>35</verse><span>znd I went out after him, and smote
    him, and delivered it out of his mouth; and when he arose against
    me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and
    slew him.
    </span><verse>36</verse><span>Thy servant slew both the
    lion and the bear; and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as
    one of them seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God.
   </span></block>

  </quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>37</verse><span>David said moreover:</span><quote><span>
   The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of
   the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this
   Philistine.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And Saul said unto David, "Go, and the LORD be with thee."
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>38</verse><span>And Saul armed David with his armor, and he put a helmet of
  brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.
  </span><verse>39</verse><span>And David girded his sword upon his armor, and he assayed to
  go; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, "I
  cannot go with these; for I have not proved them." And David put
  them off him.
  </span><verse>40</verse><span>And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth
  stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which
  he had, even in a scrip; and his sling was in his hand; and he
  drew near to the Philistine.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>41</verse><span>And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the
  man that bare the shield went before him.
  </span><verse>42</verse><span>And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he
  disdained him; for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair
  countenance.
  </span><verse>43</verse><span>And the Philistine said unto David:</span><quote><span>
   Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.
  </span><verse>44</verse><span>And the Philistine said to David:
  </span><quote><span>
   Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air,
   and to the beasts of the field.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>45</verse><span>Then said David to the Philistine:</span><quote><span>
   Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a
   shield; but I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts, the
   God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.
   </span><verse>46</verse><span>This day will the LORD deliver thee
   into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from
   thee, and I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines
   this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the
   earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.
   </span><verse>47</verse><span>And all this assembly shall know that
   the LORD saveth not with sword and spear; for the battle is the
   LORD's, and he will give you into our hands.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>48</verse><span>And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and
  drew nigh to meet David, that David hasted, and ran toward the
  army to meet the Philistine.
  </span><verse>49</verse><span>And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and
  slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the
  stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the
  earth.
  </span><verse>50</verse><span>So David prevailed over the Philistines with a sling and with a
  stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no
  sword in the hand of David.
  </span><verse>51</verse><span>Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took
  his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him,
  and cut off his head therewith.
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled.
  </span><verse>52</verse><span>And the men of Israel and of Judah
  arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou come
  to the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the
  Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and
  unto Ekron.
  </span><verse>53</verse><span>And the children of Israel
  returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled
  their tents.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>54</verse><span>And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to
  Jerusalem; but he put his armor in his tent.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>55</verse><span>And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he
  said unto Abner, the captain of the host, "Abner, whose son is
  this youth?" And Abner said, "As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell."
  </span><verse>56</verse><span>And the king said, "Inquire thou
  whose son the stripling is."
  </span><verse>57</verse><span>And as
  David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took
  him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine
  in his hand.
  </span><verse>58</verse><span>And Saul said to him,
  "Whose son art thou, thou young man?" And David answered, "I am
  the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite."

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto
  Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David,

  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home

  </span><verse>3</verse><span>Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him

  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him,

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved

  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from
  the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all
  cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with
  tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of music.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And the women answered one another as they played, and said:
  Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten
  thousands.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he
  said:</span><quote><span>
   They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have
   ascribed but thousands; and what can he have more but the kingdom?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.

  hand.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And Saul cast the javelin; for
  he said:
  </span><quote><span>
   I will smite David even to the wall with it.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>And David avoided out of his presence twice.</span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him,

  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD

 <block><span>
  For Saul said, "Let not mine hand be upon him, but let the hand of

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter

   Thou shalt this day be my son-in-law in the one of the twain.

  <verse>23</verse><span>And Saul's servants spake those words in the ears of David. And

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>And the servants of Saul told him, saying, "On this manner

  <verse>26</verse><span>And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David
  well to be the king's son-in-law; and the days were not expired.

  brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants,

  </span><verse>2</verse><span>But Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in David; and Jonathan
  told David, saying:</span><quote><span>
   Saul my father seeketh to kill thee; now therefore, I pray thee,
   take heed to thyself until the morning, and abide in a secret
   place, and hide thyself;
   </span><verse>3</verse><span>and I will go
   out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art, and I
   will commune with my father of thee; and what I see, that I will
   tell thee.

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and said

   Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because
   he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works have been
   to thee-ward very good;
   </span><verse>5</verse><span>for he did put
   his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the LORD
   wrought a great salvation for all Israel; thou sawest it, and
   didst rejoice; wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent
   blood, to slay David without a cause?
  </span></quote>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan; and Saul sware:
  As the LORD liveth, he shall not be slain.

  <verse>7</verse><span>And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan showed him all those

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>And there was war again; and David went
  out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great

  </span><verse>9</verse><span>And
  the evil spirit
  </span><under>
   <note><span>from the LORD</span></note><span>which was not of the Lord</span></under><span>

  sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin; but he
  slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he smote the javelin into
  the wall; and David fled, and escaped that night.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>Saul also sent messengers unto David's house, to watch him, and
  to slay him in the morning; and Michal David's wife told him,
  saying:</span><quote><span>
   If thou save not thy life tonight, tomorrow thou shalt be slain.

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>So Michal let David down through a window; and he went, and
  fled, and escaped.

  Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of
  goats' hair for his bolster, and covered it with a cloth.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And when Saul sent messengers to take
  David, she said, "He is sick."
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>And
  Saul sent the messengers again to see David, saying, "Bring him up
  to me in the bed, that I may slay him."
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And when the messengers were come in,
  behold, there was an image in the bed, with a pillow of goats'
  hair for his bolster.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And Saul said
  unto Michal:
  </span><quote><span>
   Why hast thou deceived me so, and sent away mine enemy, that he is
   escaped?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>And Michal answered Saul, "He said unto me, 'Let me go; why should I kill thee?"</span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and
  told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went
  and dwelt in Naioth.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And it was told Saul, saying, "Behold, David is at Naioth in
  Ramah."
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And Saul sent messengers to take David; and when they saw the
  company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as
  appointed over them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers
  of Saul, and they also prophesied.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they
  prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third
  time, and they prophesied also.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that is in
  Sechu; and he asked and said, "Where are Samuel and David?" And
  one said, "Behold, they be at Naioth in Ramah."
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah; and the Spirit of God
  was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came
  to Naioth in Ramah.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before
  Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all

    David, and I then send not unto thee, and show it thee;
    </span><verse>13</verse><span>the LORD do so and much more to
    Jonathan; but if it please my father to do thee evil, then I will
    show it thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace;
    and the LORD be with thee, as he hath been with my father.
    </span><verse>14</verse><span>And thou shalt not only while yet I live show me the kindness
    of the LORD, that I die not;
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>but also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house
    forever; no, not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David
    every one from the face of the earth.</span></block>

  </quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying:
  Let the LORD even require it at the hand of David's
  enemies.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him;
  for he loved him as he loved his own soul.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>Then Jonathan said to David:</span><quote><span>
   Tomorrow is the new moon; and thou shalt be missed, because thy
   seat will be empty.
   </span><verse>19</verse><span>And when thou hast
   stayed three days, then thou shalt go down quickly, and come to
   the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in
   hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.
   </span><verse>20</verse><span>And I will shoot three arrows on the
   side thereof, as though I shot at a mark.
   </span><verse>21</verse><span>And, behold, I will send a lad,
   saying, "Go, find out the arrows." If I expressly say unto the
   lad, "Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee, take them;"
   then come thou; for there is peace to thee, and no hurt; as the
   LORD liveth.
   </span><verse>22</verse><span>But if I say thus unto
   the young man, "Behold, the arrows are beyond thee;" go thy way;
   for the LORD hath sent thee away.
   </span><verse>23</verse><span>And
   as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold,
   the LORD be between thee and me forever.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>So David hid himself in the field; and when the new moon was
  come, the king sat him down to eat meat.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a
  seat by the wall; and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's
  side, and David's place was empty.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>Nevertheless Saul spake not anything that day; for he thought,
  "Something hath befallen
  him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean."
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>And it came to pass on the morrow,
  which was the second day of the month, that David's place was
  empty; and Saul said unto Jonathan his son:
  </span><quote><span>
   Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday,
   nor today?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>28</verse><span>And Jonathan answered Saul:</span><quote><span>
   David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem;
   </span><verse>29</verse><span>and he said, "Let me go, I pray thee;
   for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he
   hath commanded me to be there; and now, if I have found favor in
   thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren."
   Therefore he cometh not unto the king's table.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>30</verse><span>Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said
  unto him:</span><quote><span>Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that
  thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion, and
  unto the confusion of thy mother's nakedness?
   </span><verse>31</verse><span>For as long as the son of Jesse
   liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy
   kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall
   surely die.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>32</verse><span>And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him,
  "Wherefore shall he be slain? What hath he done?"
  </span><verse>33</verse><span>And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him; whereby Jonathan
  knew that it was determined of his father to slay David.
  </span><verse>34</verse><span>So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat
  no meat the second day of the month; for he was grieved for
  David, because his father had done him shame.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>35</verse><span>And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into
  the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad
  with him.
  </span><verse>36</verse><span>And he said unto his lad, "Run, find out now the arrows which I
  shoot." And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.
  </span><verse>37</verse><span>And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which
  Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, "Is
  not the arrow beyond thee?"
  </span><verse>38</verse><span>And Jonathan cried after the lad, "Make speed, haste, stay
  not." And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his
  master.
  </span><verse>39</verse><span>But the lad knew not anything; only Jonathan and David knew the
  matter.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>40</verse><span>And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto
  him, "Go, carry them to the city."
  </span><verse>41</verse><span>And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place
  toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed
  himself three times; and they kissed one another, and wept one
  with another, until David exceeded.
  </span><verse>42</verse><span>And Jonathan said to David:</span><quote><span>
   Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of
   the LORD, saying, "The LORD be between me and thee, and between my
   seed and thy seed forever."
  </span></quote>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest; and Ahimelech

  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And David said unto Ahimelech the priest:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>
    The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, "Let

   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>3</verse><span>Now therefore what is under thine hand? Give me five loaves of

  <verse>4</verse><span>And the priest answered David, and said:</span><quote><span>
   There is no common bread under mine hand, but there is hallowed
   bread; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>And David answered the priest, and said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days,
   since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and
   the bread is in a manner common, yea, though it were sanctified
   this day in the vessel.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>So the priest gave him hallowed bread; for there was no bread
  there but the showbread, that was taken from before the LORD, to
  put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day,
  detained before the LORD; and his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the

  </span><verse>8</verse><span>And David said unto Ahimelech:</span><quote><span>
   And is there not here under thine hand spear or sword? For I have
   neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the
   king's business required haste.
  </span></quote>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>And the priest said:</span><quote><span>
   The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the

   ephod; if thou wilt take that, take it; for there is no other save

  <verse>12</verse><span>And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid

  mad in their hands; and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and
  let his spittle fall down upon his beard.

   Hear now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of

   <block><span>
    Thou art more righteous than I; for thou hast rewarded me good,
    whereas I have rewarded thee evil.
    </span><verse>18</verse><span>And
    thou hast showed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me;
    forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me into thy hand, thou
    killedst me not.
    </span><verse>19</verse><span>For if a man find his
    enemy, will he let him go well away?
    Wherefore the LORD reward thee good for that thou hast done unto
    me this day.
    </span><verse>20</verse><span>And now, behold, I know
    well that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of

 <chapter>25

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together,
  and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And
  David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel;
  and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and
  a thousand goats; and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>Now the name of the man was Nabal, and the name of his wife
  Abigail; and she was a woman of good understanding, and of a
  beautiful countenance; but the man was churlish and evil in his
  doings; and he was of the hose of Caleb.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his
  sheep.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young
  men:</span><quote><span>
   Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name;
   </span><verse>6</verse><span>and thus shall ye say to him that
   liveth in prosperity, "Peace be both to thee, and peace be to
   thine house, and peace be unto all that thou hast.
   </span><verse>7</verse><span>And now I have heard that thou hast
   shearers; now thy shepherds which were with us, we hurt them not,
   neither was there aught missing unto them, all the while they were
   in Carmel.
   </span><verse>8</verse><span>Ask thy young men, and they
   will show thee. Wherefore let the young men find favor in thine
   eyes; for we come in a good day; give, I pray thee, whatsoever
   cometh to thine hand unto thy servants, and to thy son David."
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>And when David's young men came, they spake to Nabal according
  to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And Nabal answered David's servants, and said:</span><quote><span>
   Who is David? And who is the son of Jesse? There be many servants
   nowadays that break away every man from his master.
   </span><verse>11</verse><span>Shall I then take my bread, and my
   water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give
   it unto men, whom I know not whence they be?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>So David's young men turned their way, and went again, and came
  and told him all those sayings.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And David said unto his men, "Gird ye on every man his sword."
  And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on
  his sword; and there went up after David about four hundred men;
  and two hundred abode by the stuff.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife,
  saying:</span><quote><span>
   Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our
   master; and he railed on them.
   </span><verse>15</verse><span>But the
   men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed
   we anything as long as we were conversant with them, when we were
   in the fields.
   </span><verse>16</verse><span>They were a wall unto
   us both by night and day, all the while we were with them keeping
   the sheep.
   </span><verse>17</verse><span>Now therefore know and
   consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our
   master, and against all his household; for he is such a son of
   Belial, that a man cannot speak to him.
  </span></quote>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>Then Abigail made haste, and took two
  hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready
  dressed, and

  <note>
   <superscript><span>a</span></superscript><span>60 lb or 27 kg</span></note><span>five measures of parched
   corn, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of
   figs, and laid them on asses.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And she
  said unto her servants, "Go on before me; behold, I come after
  you." But she told not her husband Nabal.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And it was so, as she rode on the ass,
  that she came down by the covert of the hill, and, behold, David
  and his men came down against her; and she met them.

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>Now David had said:</span><quote><span>
   Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow hath in the
   wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto
   him; and he hath requited me evil for good.
   </span><verse>22</verse><span>So and more also do God unto the
   enemies of David, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the
   morning light any that fighteth against the wall.

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the

   <block><span>
    Upon me, my lord, upon me let this iniquity be; and let thine

    of thine handmaid.
    </span><verse>25</verse><span>Let not my lord, I
    pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even Nabal; for as his name
    is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him; but I
    thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst
    send.
   </span></block>

    <verse>26</verse><span>Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul

    </span><verse>27</verse><span>And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my
    lord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow my
    lord.
    </span><verse>28</verse><span>I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid; for the
    LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord
    fighteth the battles of the LORD, and evil hath not been found
    in thee all thy days.
    </span><verse>29</verse><span>Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul; but
    the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with

   Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which sent thee this day to
   meet me;
   </span><verse>33</verse><span>and blessed be thy advice,
   and blessed be thou, which hast kept me this day from coming to
   shed blood, and from avenging myself with mine own hand.
   </span><verse>34</verse><span>For in very deed, as the LORD God of
   Israel liveth, which hath kept me back from hurting thee, except
   thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been
   left unto Nabal by the morning light any that pisseth against the

  <verse>36</verse><span>And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his
  house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry

  nothing, less or more, until the morning light.
  </span><verse>37</verse><span>But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out

  <verse>42</verse><span>And Abigail hasted, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five

  </span><verse>43</verse><span>David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of

 <chapter>26
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, "Doth not
  David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before
  Jeshimon?"
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph,
  having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek
  David in the wilderness of Ziph.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before
  Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he
  saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was
  come in very deed.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched;
  and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of
  Ner, the captain of his host; and Saul lay in the trench, and
  the people pitched round about him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to
  Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, "Who will
  go down with me to Saul to the camp?" And Abishai said, "I will
  go down with thee."
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>So David and Abishai came to the people by night; and, behold,
  Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the
  ground at his bolster; but Abner and the people lay round about
  him.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>Then said Abishai to David:</span><quote><span>
   God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day; now
   therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear even to
   the earth at once, and I will not smite him the second time.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>And David said to Abishai:</span><quote><span>
   Destroy him not; for who can stretch forth his hand against the
   LORD's anointed, and be guiltless?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>David said furthermore:</span><quote><span>
   As the LORD liveth, the LORD shall smite him; or his day shall
   come to die; or he shall descend into battle, and perish.
   </span><verse>11</verse><span>The LORD forbid that I should stretch
   forth mine hand against the LORD's anointed; but, I pray thee,
   take thou now the spear that is at his bolster, and the cruse of
   water, and let us go.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's
  bolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw it, nor knew it,
  neither awaked; for they were all asleep; because a deep sleep
  from the LORD was fallen upon them.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>Then David went over to the other side, and stood at the top of
  a hill afar off; a great space being between them;
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>and David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner,
  saying, "Answerest thou not, Abner?" Then Abner answered and
  said, "Who art thou that criest to the king?"
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And David said to Abner:</span><quote><span>
   Art not thou a valiant man? And who is like to thee in Israel?
   Wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king? For there
   came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord.
   </span><verse>16</verse><span>This thing is not good that thou hast
   done. As the LORD liveth, ye are worthy to die, because ye have
   not kept your master, the LORD's anointed. And now see where the
   king's spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his bolster.

  <verse>17</verse><span>And Saul knew David's voice, and said, "Is this thy voice, my

   Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant? For what
   have I done? Or what evil is in mine hand?
   </span><verse>19</verse><span>Now therefore, I pray thee, let my
   lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the LORD have
   stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering; but if
   they be the children of men, cursed be they before the LORD; for
   they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance
   of the LORD, saying, "Go, serve other gods."
   </span><verse>20</verse><span>Now therefore, let not my blood fall
   to the earth before the face of the LORD; for the king of Israel
   is come out to seek a flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in
   the mountains.

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>Then said Saul:</span><quote><span>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>And David answered and said:</span><quote><span>
   Behold the king's spear! And let one of the young men come over

   </span><verse>23</verse><span>The LORD render to every
   man his righteousness and his faithfulness; for the LORD delivered
   thee into my hand today, but I would not stretch forth mine hand
   against the LORD's anointed.
   </span><verse>24</verse><span>And,
   behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let
   my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD, and let him
   deliver me out of all tribulation.

  <verse>21</verse><span>And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore
  troubled, and said unto him:
  </span><quote><span>
   Behold, thine handmaid hath obeyed
   thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened
   unto thy words which thou spakest unto me.
   </span><verse>22</verse><span>Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid,
   and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou
   mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.

  <verse>23</verse><span>But he refused, and said, "I will not eat." But his servants,
  together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto
  their voice. So he rose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and
  killed it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake
  unleavened bread thereof;
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>and she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and
  they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night.

  Achish send David back to Ziklag

 <chapter>29
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to
  Aphek; and the Israelites pitched by a fountain which is in
  Jezreel.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by
  thousands; but David and his men passed on in the rearward with
  Achish.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>Then said the princes of the Philistines, "What do these
  Hebrews here?"
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines:
  </span><quote><span>
   Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, which
   hath been with me these days, or these years, and I have found no
   fault in him since he fell unto me unto this day?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the
  princes of the Philistines said unto him:</span><quote><span>Make this fellow return, that he may go again to his place
  which thou hast appointed him; and let him not go down with us
  to battle, lest in the battle he be an adversary to us; for
  wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master? Should it
  not be with the heads of these men?
   </span><verse>5</verse><span>Is not this David, of whom they sang
   one to another in dances, saying, "Saul slew his thousands, and
   David his ten thousands"?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>Then Achish called David, and said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   Surely, as the LORD liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going
   out and thy coming in with me in the host is good in my sight; for
   I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me
   unto this day; nevertheless the lords favor thee not.
   </span><verse>7</verse><span>Wherefore now return, and go in peace,
   that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>And David said unto Achish:</span><quote><span>
   But what have I done? And what hast thou found in thy servant so
   long as I have been with thee unto this day, that I may not go
   fight against the enemies of my lord the king?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>And Achish answered and said to David:</span><quote><span>
   I know that thou art good in my sight, as an angel of God;
   notwithstanding, the princes of the Philistines have said, "He
   shall not go up with us to the battle."
   </span><verse>10</verse><span>Wherefore now rise up early in the
   morning with thy master's servants that are come with thee; and as
   soon as ye be up early in the morning, and have light, depart.
  </span></quote>

 <chapter>30

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag
  on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the south, and
  Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire;
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>and had taken the women captives,
  that were therein; they slew not any, either great or small, but
  carried them away, and went on their way.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>So David and his men came to the city,
  and, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their
  sons, and their daughters, were taken captives.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>Then David and the people that were
  with him lifted up their voices and wept, until they had not more
  power to weep.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>And David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the
  Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of
  stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved,
  every man for his sons and for his daughters; but David
  encouraged himself in the LORD his God.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son:</span><quote><span>
   I pray thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought
   thither the ephod to David.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>And David inquired at the LORD, saying:</span><quote><span>
   Shall I pursue after this troop? Shall I overtake them?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And he answered him:
  </span><quote><span>
   Pursue; for thou shalt surely overtake them, and without fail
   recover all.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him,
  and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind
  stayed.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>But David pursued, he and four hundred men; for two hundred
  abode behind, which were so faint that they could not go over
  the brook Besor.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to
  David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him
  drink water;
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>and they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters
  of raisins; and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him
  for he had eaten no bread, nor drank any water, three days and
  three nights.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And David said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   To whom belongest thou? And whence art thou?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And he said:
  </span><quote><span>
   I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master
   left me, because three days agone I fell sick.
   </span><verse>14</verse><span>We made an invasion upon the south of
   the Cherethites, and upon the coast which belongeth to Judah, and
   upon the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And David said to him, "Canst thou bring me down to this

 </span></block>

 <block><span>And he said:</span><quote><span>
   Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver
   me into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this
   company.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread
  abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing,
  because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the
  land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of
  the next day; and there escaped not a man of them, save four
  hundred young men, which rode upon camels, and fled.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away;
  and David rescued his two wives.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great,
  neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor anything that
  they had taken to them; David recovered all.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drave
  before those other cattle, and said, "This is David's
  spoil."
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint that
  they could not follow David, whom they had made also to abide at
  the brook Besor; and they went forth to meet David, and to meet
  the people that were with him; and when David came near to
  the people, he saluted them.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>Then answered all the wicked men, and
  men of Belial, of those that went with David, and said:
  </span><quote><span>
   Because they went not with us, we will not give them aught of the
   spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his
   children, that they may lead them away, and depart.

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>Then said David:</span><quote><span>
   Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the LORD hath

   </span><verse>24</verse><span>For who

 <chapter>31
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of
  Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in
  mount Gilboa.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons;
  and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Melchi-
  Shua, Saul's sons.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him;
  and he was sore wounded of the archers.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>Then said Saul unto his armor-bearer:</span><quote><span>
   Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these
   uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  But his armor-bearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore
  Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And when his armor-bearer saw that Saul
  was dead, he fell likewise upon his sword, and died with him.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>So Saul died, and his three sons, and
  his armor-bearer, and all his men, that same day together.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the
  valley, and they that were on the other side Jordan, saw that
  the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead,
  they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and
  dwelt in them.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to
  strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen
  in mount Gilboa.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armor, and sent
  into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish it in
  the house of their idols, and among the people.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And they put his armor in the house of Ashtaroth; and they
  fastened his body to the wall of Beth-Shan.

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>And when the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead heard of that which
  the Philistines had done to Saul,
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>all the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the
  body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of
  Beth-Shan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.

 <chapter>1
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned
  from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in
  Ziklag;
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>it came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of
  the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head; and
  so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did
  obeisance.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>And David said unto him, "From whence comest thou?" And he said unto
  him, "Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped."
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And David said unto him, "How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me."
  And he answered:</span><quote><span>
   That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are
   fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>And David said unto the young man that told him:</span><quote><span>
   How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And the young man that told him said:</span><quote><span>
   As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his
   spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.
   </span><verse>7</verse><span>And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and
   called unto me. And I answered, "Here am I."
   </span><verse>8</verse><span>And he said unto me, "Who art thou?" And I
   answered him, "I am an Amalekite."
   </span><verse>9</verse><span>He said unto
   me again, "Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me; for anguish is come
   upon me, because my life is yet whole in me."
   </span><verse>10</verse><span>So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I
   was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen; and I took the
   crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm and
   have brought them hither unto my lord.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all
  the men that were with him.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for
  Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of
  Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>And David said unto the young man that told him, "Whence art thou?" And
  he answered, "I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite."
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And David said unto him. "How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth
  thine hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?"
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>And David called one of the young men, and said, "Go near, and fall
  upon him." And he smote him that he died.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And David said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee,
   saying, "I have slain the LORD's anointed."

   <block>
    <verse>21</verse><span>Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain,

  <verse>8</verse><span>But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took Ishbosheth the
  son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>and made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over
  Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>Ishbosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to reign over
  Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was
  seven years and six months.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of
  Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and
  met together by the pool of Gibeon; and they sat down, the one on the
  one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>And Abner said to Joab, "Let the young men now arise, and play before
  us."
 </span></block>

 <block><span>And Joab said, "Let them arise."</span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, which
  pertained to Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of
  David.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And they caught every
  one his fellow by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow's side; so
  they fell down together; wherefore that place was called Helkath-Zazzurim,
  which is in Gibeon.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was beaten, and
  the men of Israel, before the servants of David.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai, and
  Asahel; and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right
  hand nor to the left from following Abner.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>Then Abner looked behind him, and said, "Art thou Asahel?" And he
  answered, "I am."
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>And Abner said to him:</span><quote><span>
   Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay thee hold on one
   of the young men, and take thee his armor.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  But Asahel would not turn aside from following of him.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>And Abner said again to Asahel:
  </span><quote><span>Turn thee

  How then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?</span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>Howbeit he refused to turn aside; wherefore Abner with the hinder end
  of the spear smote him under the fifth rib, that the spear came out
  behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place; and it
  came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down
  and died stood still.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner; and the sun went down when
  they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giah by the way
  of the wilderness of Gibeon.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner,
  and became one troop, and stood on the top of a hill.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>26</verse><span>Then Abner called to Joab, and said:</span><quote><span>
   Shall the sword devour forever? Knowest thou not that it will be a

   people return from following their brethren?
  </span></quote>

  <verse>27</verse><span>And Joab said:</span><quote><span>

 <block>
  <verse>28</verse><span>So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued

  <verse>29</verse><span>And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain, and
  passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to

  </span><verse>30</verse><span>And Joab returned from following Abner; and when he had gathered all
  the people together, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men and
  Asahel.

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of
  David; but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul
  waxed weaker and weaker.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>And unto David were sons born in Hebron, and his first-born was Amnon,
  of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>and his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite;
  and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of
  Geshur;

  Abner joins David
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and
  the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of
  Saul.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah;
  and Ishbosheth said to Abner:</span><quote><span>
   Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father's concubine?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and said:</span><quote><span>
   Am I a dog's head, which against Judah do show kindness this day unto the
   house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have
   not delivered thee into the hand of David, that thou chargest me today
   with a fault concerning this woman?
   </span><verse>9</verse><span>So do God
   to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD hath sworn to David, even so
   I do to him.
   </span><verse>10</verse><span>To translate the kingdom from the
   house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over
   Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, "Whose is the
  land?" Saying also:</span><quote><span>
   Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring
   about all Israel unto thee.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>And he said:</span><quote><span>
   Well; I will make a league with thee; but one thing I require of thee,
   that is, thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal Saul's
   daughter, when thou comest to see my face.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul's son, saying:</span><quote><span>
   Deliver me my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for a hundred foreskins
   of the Philistines.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Phaltiel
  the son of Laish.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim. Then
  said Abner unto him, "Go, return." And he returned.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying:</span><quote><span>
   Ye sought for David in times past to be king over you;
   </span><verse>18</verse><span>now then do it; for the LORD hath spoken of
   David, saying, "By the hand of my servant David I will save my people
   Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all
   their enemies."
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin; and Abner went also to
  speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and
  that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David
  made Abner and his men that were with him a feast.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>And Abner said unto David:</span><quote><span>
   I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king,
   that they may make a league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all
   that thine heart desireth.

  Joab kills Abner

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing a troop,
  and brought in a great spoil with them; but Abner was not with David in
  Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told Joab,
  saying:</span><quote><span>
   Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he
   is gone in peace.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>Then Joab came to the king, and said:</span><quote><span>
   What hast thou done? Behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou
   hast sent him away, and he is quite gone?
   </span><verse>25</verse><span>Thou
   knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know
   thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>26</verse><span>And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner,
  which brought him again from the well of Sirah; but David knew it not.
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate
  to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the fifth rib, that
  he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>28</verse><span>And afterward when David heard it, he said:</span><quote><span>
   I and my kingdom are guiltless before the LORD forever from the blood of
   Abner the son of Ner;
   </span><verse>29</verse><span>let it rest on the head
   of Joab, and on all his father's house; and let there not fail from the
   house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth
   on a staff, or that falleth on the sword, or that lacketh bread.
  </span></quote>

  <verse>30</verse><span>So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain their

  <verse>31</verse><span>And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him:</span><quote><span>
   Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And king David himself followed the bier.
  </span><verse>32</verse><span>And
  they buried Abner in Hebron; and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at
  the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.
  </span><verse>33</verse><span>And the king lamented over Abner, and said:
  </span><quote><span>
   Died Abner as a fool dieth?
   </span><verse>34</verse><span>Thy hands were not
   bound, nor thy feet put into fetters; as a man falleth before wicked men,

  And all the people wept again over him.

  <verse>38</verse><span>And the king said unto his servants:</span><quote><span>
   Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in

 <chapter>4

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And when Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands were
  feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And Saul's son had two men that were captains of bands; the name of the
  one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon a
  Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin. (for Beeroth also was reckoned
  to Benjamin;
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners there until
  this day.)
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was
  five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of
  Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled, and it came to pass, as
  she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was
  Mephibosheth.

  <verse>5</verse><span>And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and
  came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who lay on a
  bed at noon.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And they came
  thither into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched
  wheat; and they smote him under the fifth rib; and Rechab and Baanah his
  brother escaped.

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his bedchamber,
  and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head,
  and gat them away through the plain all night.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron, and said
  to the king:</span><quote><span>
   Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul thine enemy, which sought
   thy life; and the LORD hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and
   of his seed.
  </span></quote>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon

   As the LORD liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,
   </span><verse>10</verse><span>when one told me, saying, "Behold, Saul is
   dead," thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew
   him in Ziklag, who thought that I would have given him a reward for his
   tidings;
   </span><verse>11</verse><span>how much more, when wicked men have
   slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed? Shall I not
   therefore now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the
   earth?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off

 <chapter>5
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake,
  saying, "Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that
  leddest out and broughtest in Israel; and the LORD said to thee, 'Thou
  shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a captain over
  Israel.'"
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David
  made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed
  David king over Israel.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty
  years.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months; and in
  Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and
  Judah.

  <verse>6</verse><span>And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the

  take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither;"
  thinking, David cannot come in hither.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>Nevertheless, David took the stronghold of Zion; the same is the city

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>And David said on that day:</span><quote><span>
   Whosoever getteth up to the gutter, and smiteth the Jebusites, and the

   captain.
  </span></quote>

  Wherefore they said, "The blind and the lame shall not come into the

  <verse>9</verse><span>So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David

  <verse>11</verse><span>And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and

  <verse>13</verse><span>And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he

  it, and went down to the hold.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of
  Rephaim.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And David inquired of the LORD, saying:</span><quote><span>
   Shall I go up to the Philistines? Wilt thou deliver them into mine hand?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And the LORD said unto David:
  </span><quote><span>
   Go up; for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thine hand.

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>And David came to Baalperazim, and David smote them there, and

   The LORD hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me, as the breach of

 <block><span>
  Therefore he called the name of that place Baal-Perazim.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>And there they left their images, and David

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the

  </span><verse>23</verse><span>And when David inquired of the LORD, he said:</span><quote><span>
   Thou shalt not go up; but fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them
   over against the mulberry trees.
   </span><verse>24</verse><span>And let it
   be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry

  <verse>1</verse><span>Again, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty

  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from
  Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose name is
  called by the name of the LORD of hosts that dwelleth between the
  cherubim.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the
  house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah; and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of
  Abinadab, drave the new cart.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at Gibeah,
  accompanying the ark of God; and Ahio went before the ark.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on all
  manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps, and on
  psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And when they came to Nachon's threshing floor, Uzzah put forth his
  hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah, and God smote him
  there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon
  Uzzah; and he called the name of the place Perez-Uzzah to this
  day.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said:
  </span><quote><span>How shall the ark
  of the LORD come to me?</span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>So David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into the city of
  David; but David carried it aside into the house of Obed-Edom the
  Gittite.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And the ark of the
  LORD continued in the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite three months; and the
  LORD blessed Obed-Edom, and all his household.

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>And it was told king David, saying:</span><quote><span>
   The LORD hath blessed the house of Obed-Edom, and all that pertaineth unto

  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-Edom
 into the city of David with gladness.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And it was so, that when they that bare the
  ark of the LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And David danced before the LORD with all his
  might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>So David and all the house of Israel brought
  up the ark of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal Saul's
  daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing
  before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his place, in
  the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it; and David
  offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offering and
  peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of
  Israel, as well to the women as men, to everyone a cake of bread, and a
  good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine. So all the people departed
  everyone to his house.

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of

   How glorious was the king of Israel today, who uncovered himself today in

   shamelessly uncovereth himself!

  <verse>21</verse><span>And David said unto Michal:</span><quote><span>
   It was before the LORD, which chose me before thy father, and before all

   therefore will I play before the LORD;
   </span><verse>22</verse><span>and I
   will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in mine own sight; and
   of the maidservants which thou has spoken of, of them shall I be had in

    <verse>5</verse><span>Go and tell my servant David, "Thus said the LORD: Shalt thou build me

    </span><verse>6</verse><span>Whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up
    the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked

    <verse>8</verse><span>Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, "Thus saith the

    thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like

    </span><verse>10</verse><span>Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant
    them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more;
    neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them anymore, as before
    time,
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>and as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people
    Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the

    <verse>12</verse><span>And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers,

    his kingdom forever.
    </span><verse>14</verse><span>I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I
    will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the
    children of men.
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from Saul,
    whom I put away before thee.

    </span><verse>20</verse><span>And what can David say more unto thee? For
    thou, LORD God, knowest thy servant.
    </span><verse>21</verse><span>For thy
    word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all these
    great things, to make thy servant know them.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>22</verse><span>Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God; for there is none like thee,
    neither is there any God besides thee, according to all that we have
    heard with our ears.
    </span><verse>23</verse><span>And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like Israel,
    whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name,
    and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy
    people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, from the nations and
    their gods?
    </span><verse>24</verse><span>For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to be a people
    unto thee forever; and thou, Lord, art become their God.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>25</verse><span>And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy
    servant, and concerning his house, establish it forever, and do as thou
    hast said.
    </span><verse>26</verse><span>And let thy name be magnified forever, saying, "The LORD of hosts is
    the God over Israel;" and let the house of thy servant David be
    established before thee.
    </span><verse>27</verse><span>For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant,
    saying, "I will build thee a house;" therefore hath thy servant found in
    his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>28</verse><span>And now, O Lord GOD, thou art that God, and thy words be true, and thou
    hast promised this goodness unto thy servant;
    </span><verse>29</verse><span>therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant,
    that it may continue forever before thee; for thou, O Lord GOD, hast
    spoken it; and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed
    forever.</span></block>

  </span><verse>9</verse><span>When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the hosts of
  Hadadezer,
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him, and to

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, was come

   Fear not; for I will surely show thee kindness for Jonathan thy father's

  Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.

 <chapter>11

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when kings
  go forth to battle, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and
  all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged
  Rabbah. But David tarried still at Jerusalem.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>And it came to pass in an evening-tide, that David arose from off his
  bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house; and from the roof he
  saw a woman washing herself; and the woman was very beautiful to look
  upon.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And David sent and inquired after the woman. And one said, "Is not this
  Bath-Sheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?"
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him and
  he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness; and she
  returned unto her house.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, "I am with
  child."
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And David sent to Joab, saying, "Send me Uriah the Hittite." And Joab
  sent Uriah to David.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And when Uriah was come unto him, David demanded of him how Joab did,
  and how the people did, and how the war prospered.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>And David said to Uriah:</span><quote><span>
   Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there followed him a mess
  of meat from the king.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>But Uriah slept at the
  door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and went not
  down to his house.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And when they had told
  David, saying, "Uriah went not down unto his house," David said unto
  Uriah:
  </span><quote><span>
   Camest thou not from thy journey? Why then didst thou not go down unto
   thine house?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>And Uriah said unto David:</span><quote><span>
   The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the
   servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into
   mine house, to eat and drink, and to lie with my wife? As thou livest, and
   as thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing.
  </span></quote>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>And David said to Uriah:</span><quote><span>
   Tarry here today also, and tomorrow I will let thee depart.

 </block>

 <block><span>
  So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the morrow.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And when David had called him, he did eat and
  drink before him; and he made him drunk; and at even he went out to lie on
  his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab,
  and sent it by the hand of Uriah.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>And he wrote in the letter, saying, "Set ye Uriah in the forefront of
  the hottest battle, and retire ye from him that he may be smitten, and
  die."
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he assigned
  Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men were.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab; and there fell
  some of the people of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died
  also.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>and charged the messenger, saying:</span><quote><span>
   When thou hast made an end of telling the matters of the war unto the
   king,
   </span><verse>20</verse><span>and if so be that the king's wrath
   arise, and he say unto thee, "Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the
   city when ye did fight? Knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall?
   </span><verse>21</verse><span>Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth?
   Did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that
   he died in Thebez? Why went ye nigh the wall?" Then say thou, "Thy servant
   Uriah the Hittite is dead also."
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>So the messenger went, and came and showed David all that Joab had sent
  him for.
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>And the messenger said unto David:</span><quote><span>
   Surely the men prevailed against us, and came out unto us into the field,
   and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate.
   </span><verse>24</verse><span>And the shooters shot from off the wall upon
   thy servants; and some of the king's servants be dead, and thy servant
   Uriah the Hittite is dead also.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>25</verse><span>Then David said unto the messenger:</span><quote><span>
   Thus shalt thou say unto Joab, "Let not this thing displease thee, for the
   sword devoureth one as well as another; make thy battle more strong
   against the city, and overthrow it;" and encourage thou him.
  </span></quote>

 <block>
  <verse>26</verse><span>And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she
  mourned for her husband.
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to his
  house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But the thing that
  David had done displeased the LORD.

   <block><span>There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>And Nathan said to David:

   <block><span>
    Thou art the man. Thus saith the LORD God of Israel: I anointed thee king

    </span><verse>8</verse><span>and I gave thee thy master's house, and thy
    master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of

  <verse>15</verse><span>And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the child that

  saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them
  pass through the brick kiln; and thus did he unto all the cities of the
  children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned unto
  Jerusalem.

  Amnon and Tamar
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>13
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a
  fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for she
  was a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do anything to
  her.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah
  David's brother; and Jonadab was a very subtile man.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And he said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   Why art thou, being the king's son, lean from day to day? Wilt thou not
   tell me?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And Amnon said unto him, "I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister."
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>And Jonadab said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself sick; and when thy father
   cometh to see thee, say unto him, "I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come,
   and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see it, and
   eat it at her hand."
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>So Amnon lay down and made himself sick; and when the king was come to
  see him, Amnon said unto the king:</span><quote><span>
   I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my
   sight, that I may eat at her hand.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>Then David sent home to Tamar, saying:</span><quote><span>
   Go now to thy brother Amnon's house, and dress him meat.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down. And
  she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did
  bake the cakes.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to
  eat. And Amnon said:</span><quote><span>
   Have out all men from me.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And they went out every man from him.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And
  Amnon said unto Tamar: Bring the meat into the chamber, that I may eat of
  thine hand.
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the
  chamber to Amnon her brother.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And when she had
  brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her:
  </span><quote><span>
   Come lie with me, my sister.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>And she answered him:</span><quote><span>
   Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in
   Israel; do not thou this folly.
   </span><verse>13</verse><span>And I, whither
   shall I cause my shame to go? And as for thee, thou shalt be as one of the
   fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he
   will not withhold me from thee.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice; but, being stronger than
  she, forced her, and lay with her.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith he hated
  her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said
  to her:</span><quote><span>
   Arise, begone.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>And she said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   There is no cause; this evil in sending me away is greater than the other
   that thou didst unto me.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  But he would not hearken unto her.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>Then he
  called his servant that ministered unto him, and said:
  </span><quote><span>
   Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>And she had a garment of divers colors upon her; for with such robes
  were the king's daughters that were virgins appareled. Then his servant
  brought her out, and bolted the door after her.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colors
  that was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And Absalom her brother said unto her, "Hath Amnon thy brother been
  with thee? But hold now thy peace, my sister; he is thy brother; regard
  not this thing." So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's
  house.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad; for
  Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheep
  shearers in Baal-Hazor, which is beside Ephraim; and Absalom invited all
  the king's sons.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>And Absalom came to the king, and said, "Behold now, thy servant hath
  sheep shearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and his servants go with
  thy servant."
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>And the king said to Absalom, "Nay, my son, let us not all now go, lest
  we be chargeable unto thee."
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  And he pressed him; howbeit he would not go, but blessed him.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>Then said Absalom, "If not, I pray thee, let
  my brother Amnon go with us." And the king said unto him, "Why should he
  go with thee?"
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>But Absalom pressed him, that
  he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>28</verse><span>Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying:</span><quote><span>
   Mark ye now when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto
   you, "Smite Amnon;" then kill him, fear not; have I not commanded you? Be
   courageous, and be valiant.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>29</verse><span>And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded.
  Then all the king's sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his mule,
  and fled.
  </span><verse>30</verse><span>And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came to
  David, saying, "Absalom hath slain all the king's sons, and there is not
  one of them left."
  </span><verse>31</verse><span>Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the earth; and
  all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>32</verse><span>And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered and
  said:</span><quote><span>
   Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the king's
   sons; for Amnon only is dead; for by the appointment of Absalom this hath
   been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.
   </span><verse>33</verse><span>Now therefore let not my Lord the king take
   the thing to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead; for
   Amnon only is dead.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>34</verse><span>But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his
  eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the
  hillside behind him.
  </span><verse>35</verse><span>And Jonadab said unto the king, "Behold, the king's sons come; as thy
  servant said, so it is."
  </span><verse>36</verse><span>And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that,
  behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept; and
  the king also and all his servants wept very sore.
  </span><verse>37</verse><span>But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of
  Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>38</verse><span>So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.
  </span><verse>39</verse><span>And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom; for he was
  comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  Absalom returns to Jerusalem
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>14
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was toward
  Absalom.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And
  Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her:
  </span><quote><span>
   I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning
   apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had a
   long time mourned for the dead;
   </span><verse>3</verse><span>and come to the
   king, and speak on this manner unto him.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  So Joab put the words in her mouth.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And when
  the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fell on her face to the ground,
  and did obeisance, and said, "Help, O king."
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And the king said unto her, "What aileth thee?"
  And she answered:
  </span><quote><span>
   I am indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead.
   </span><verse>6</verse><span>And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two
   strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one
   smote the other, and slew him.
   </span><verse>7</verse><span>And, behold, the
   whole family is risen against thine handmaid, and they said, "Deliver him
   that smote his brother, that we may kill him, for the life of his brother
   whom he slew; and we will destroy the heir also;" and so they will quench
   my coal which is left, and shalt not leave to my husband neither name nor
   remainder upon the earth.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>And the king said unto the woman, "Go to thine house, and I will give
  charge concerning thee."
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, "My lord, O king, the
  iniquity be on me, and on my father's house; and the king and his throne
  be guiltless."
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And the king said, "Whosoever saith aught unto thee, bring him to me,
  and he shall not touch thee anymore"
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>Then said she, "I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy God,
  that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy anymore,
  lest they destroy my son." And he said, "As the LORD liveth, there shall
  not one hair of thy son fall to the earth."
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>Then the woman said, "Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak one word
  unto my lord the king." And he said, "Say on."
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And the woman said:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>
    Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God?
    For the king doth speak this thing as one which is faulty, in that the
    king doth not fetch home again his banished.
    </span><verse>14</verse><span>For we must needs die, and are as water spilt
    on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect
    any person; yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not expelled
    from him.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>15</verse><span>Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the
    king, it is because the people have made me afraid; and thy handmaid
    said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will
    perform the request of his handmaid.
    </span><verse>16</verse><span>For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the
    man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of
    God.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>17</verse><span>Then thine handmaid said, "The word of my lord the king shall now be
    comfortable; for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern
    good and bad; therefore the LORD thy God will be with thee."</span></block>

  </quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>Then the king answered and said unto the woman, "Hide not from me, I
  pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee." And the woman said, "Let my
  lord the king now speak."
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And the king said, "Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all this?" And
  the woman answered and said:</span><quote><span>
   As thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or
   to the left from aught that my lord the king hath spoken; for thy servant
   Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thine
   handmaid;
   </span><verse>20</verse><span>to fetch about this form of speech
   hath thy servant Joab done this thing; and my lord is wise, according to
   the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>And the king said unto Joab, "Behold now, I have done this thing; go
  therefore, bring the young man Absalom again."
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and thanked
  the king; and Joab said, "Today thy servant knoweth that I have found
  grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath fulfilled the
  request of his servant."
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>And the king said, "Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see
  my face." So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the king's
  face.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>25</verse><span>But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for
  his beauty; from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head
  there was no blemish in him.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end that he
  polled it; because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled it) he
  weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king's
  weight.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>27</verse><span>And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose
  name was Tamar; she was a woman of a fair countenance.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>28</verse><span>So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king's
  face.
  </span><verse>29</verse><span>Therefore
  Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king; but he would not come
  to him; and when he sent again the second time, he would not come.
  </span><verse>30</verse><span>Therefore he said unto his servants, "See,
  Joab's field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on
  fire." And Absalom's servants set the field on fire.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>31</verse><span>Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house and said unto him,
  "Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?"
  </span><verse>32</verse><span>And Absalom answered Joab:</span><quote><span>
   Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, "Come hither, that I may send thee to
   the king, to say, 'Wherefore am I come from Geshur? It had been good for
   me to have been there still;'" now therefore let me see the king's face;
   and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>33</verse><span>So Joab came to the king, and told him; and when he had called for
  Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the
  ground before the king; and the king kissed Absalom.

  Absalom's conspiracy
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>15
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and
  horses, and fifty men to run before him.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate; and it
  was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for
  judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, "Of what city art
  thou?" And he said, "Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel."
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And Absalom said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the
   king to hear thee.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Absalom said moreover:</span><quote><span>
   Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit
   or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him to do him obeisance,
  he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for
  judgment; so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the
  king:</span><quote><span>
   I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD,
   in Hebron.
   </span><verse>8</verse><span>For thy servant vowed a vow while I
   abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, "If the LORD shall bring me again indeed
   to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD."
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>And the king said unto him, "Go in peace."
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  So he arose, and went to Hebron.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>But Absalom
  sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying:
  </span><quote><span>
   As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, "Absalom
   reigneth in Hebron."
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were
  called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not anything.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counselor, from
  his city, even from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the
  conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with
  Absalom.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>And there came a messenger to David, saying:</span><quote><span>
   The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>And David said unto all his servants that were with him at
  Jerusalem:</span><quote><span>
   Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else escape from Absalom; make
   speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and
   smite the city with the edge of the sword.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And the king's servants said unto the king:</span><quote><span>
   Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall
   appoint.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king
  left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the house.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a
  place that was far off.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and
  all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came
  after him from Gath, passed on before the king.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite:</span><quote><span>
   Wherefore goest thou also with us? Return to thy place, and abide with the
   king; for thou art a stranger, and also an exile.
   </span><verse>20</verse><span>Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I
   this day make thee go up and down with us? Seeing I go whither I may,
   return thou, and take back thy brethren; mercy and truth be with thee.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>And Ittai answered the king, and said:</span><quote><span>
   As the LORD liveth, and as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place
   my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will
   thy servant be.
  </span></quote>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>And David said to Ittai, "Go and pass over." And Ittai the Gittite
  passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with
  him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed
  over; the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the
  people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>And lo, Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing the ark

  went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.

 <block>
  <verse>25</verse><span>And the king said unto Zadok:</span><quote><span>
   Carry back the ark of God into the city; if I shall find favor in the eyes
   of the LORD, he will bring me again, and show me both it, and his
   habitation;
   </span><verse>26</verse><span>but if he thus say, "I have no
   delight in thee;" behold, here am I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto
   him.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>27</verse><span>The king said also unto Zadok the priest:</span><quote><span>
   Art not thou a seer? Return into the city in peace, and your two sons with
   you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.
   </span><verse>28</verse><span>See, I will tarry in the plain of the

 <block>
  <verse>29</verse><span>Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem;
  and they tarried there.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>30</verse><span>And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he went
  up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot; and all the people
  that was with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping
  as they went up.
  </span><verse>31</verse><span>And one told David, saying, "Ahithophel is among the conspirators with
  Absalom." And David said, "O Lord, I pray thee, turn the counsel of
  Ahithophel into foolishness."
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>32</verse><span>And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of the mount,
  where he worshiped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with
  his coat rent, and earth upon his head;
  </span><verse>33</verse><span>unto whom David said:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>
    If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me;
    </span><verse>34</verse><span>but if thou return to the city, and say unto
    Absalom, "I will be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father's
    servant hitherto, so will I now also be thy servant;" then mayest thou for
    me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.
    </span><verse>35</verse><span>And hast
    thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? Therefore it
    shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king's house,
    thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.
    </span><verse>36</verse><span>Behold, they
    have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok's son, and Jonathan
    Abiathar's son; and by them ye shall send unto me everything that ye can

  <verse>5</verse><span>And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of

  <verse>10</verse><span>And the king said:</span><quote><span>

 <heading><span>Ahithophel and Hushai counsel David

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem,
  and Ahithophel with him.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, was come
  unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, "God save the king, God
  save the king."
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>And Absalom said to Hushai:</span><quote><span>
   Is this thy kindness to thy friend? Why wentest thou not with thy friend?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>And Hushai said unto Absalom:</span><quote><span>
   Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel,
   choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide.
   </span><verse>19</verse><span>And again, whom should I serve? Should I not
   serve in the presence of his son? As I have served in thy father's
   presence, so will I be in thy presence.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, "Give counsel among you what we shall
  do."
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>And Ahithophel said unto Absalom:</span><quote><span>
   Go in unto thy father's concubines, which he hath left to keep the house;
   and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father; then shall
   the hands of all that are with thee be strong.

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom
  went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counseled in those days, was as
  if a man had inquired at the oracle of God; so was all the counsel of
  Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.
 </span></block>

 <chapter>17
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom:</span><quote><span>
   Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue
   after David this night;
   </span><verse>2</verse><span>and I will come upon
   him while he is weary and weakhanded, and will make him afraid; and all
   the people that are with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only;
   </span><verse>3</verse><span>and I will bring back all the people unto thee;
   the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned; so all the people shall
   be in peace.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>Then said Absalom:
  </span><quote><span>Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear
  likewise what he saith.</span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him,
  saying:</span><quote><span>
   Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner; shall we do after his saying? If
   not, speak thou.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>And Hushai said unto Absalom:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>
    The counsel that Ahithophel hath given is not good at this time.
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and
    his men, that they be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a
    bear robbed of her whelps in the field; and thy father is a man of war,
    and will not lodge with the people.
    </span><verse>9</verse><span>Behold, he
    is hid now in some pit, or in some other place; and it will come to pass,
    when some of them be overthrown at the first, that whosoever heareth it
    will say, "There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom."
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as
    the heart of a lion, shall utterly melt; for all Israel knoweth that thy
    father is a mighty man, and they which be with him are valiant men.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>11</verse><span>Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee,
    from Dan even to Beer-Sheba, as the sand that is by the sea for
    multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person.
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we
    will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground; and of him and of
    all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one.
    </span><verse>13</verse><span>Moreover, if
    he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city,
    and we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small stone
    found there.

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>And Absalom and all the men of Israel said:</span><quote><span>
   The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of

   Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom.

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests:</span><quote><span>
   Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and

  <verse>17</verse><span>Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by En-Rogel; for they might not be seen

  </span><verse>18</verse><span>Nevertheless, a lad saw them, and told Absalom; but they went both of
  them away quickly, and came to a man's house in Bahurim, which had a
  well in his court; whither they went down.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth, and
  spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known.

  <verse>23</verse><span>And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and all

  </span><verse>25</verse><span>And Absalom made Amasa captain of the hosts instead of Joab; which
  Amasa was a man's son, whose name was Ithra an Israelite, that went in

  <verse>27</verse><span>And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of

  Joab's brother, and the third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the
  king said unto the people:
  </span><quote><span>
   I will surely go forth with you myself also.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>But the people answered:</span><quote><span>
   Thou shalt not go forth; for if we flee away, they will not care for us;

  And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by

  </span><quote><span>
   Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom.

 <block><span>
  And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge

  </span><verse>6</verse><span>So the people went out into
  the field against Israel; and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim;
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>where the people of Israel were slain before
  the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of
  twenty thousand men.

  <verse>9</verse><span>And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule,

    Ittai, saying, "Beware that none touch the young man Absalom."
   </span><verse>13</verse><span>Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood

  <verse>14</verse><span>Then said Joab:</span><quote><span>

  And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of
  Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a

   We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse;
   every man to his tents, O Israel.

  <verse>2</verse><span>So every man of Israel went up from after David, and followed Sheba the

  <verse>3</verse><span>And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten

  <verse>1</verse><span>And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he

  </span><verse>2</verse><span>For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which was with

   Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba, and

  <verse>5</verse><span>And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of

  came to Dan-Jaan, and about to Zidon,
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>and came to the stronghold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the
  Hivites, and of the Canaanites; and they went out to the south of Judah,

  </span><verse>8</verse><span>So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at
  the end of nine months and twenty days.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king; and
  there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the

  David said unto the LORD:</span><quote><span>
   I have sinned greatly in that I have done; and now, I beseech thee, O
   Lord, take away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very
   foolishly.

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD came unto
  the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying:</span><quote>
   <verse>12</verse><span>Go and say unto David, "Thus saith the LORD: I offer thee three things;
   choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee."</span></quote>

  <verse>13</verse><span>So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? Or wilt thou flee
   three months before thine enemies, while they pursue thee? Or that there
   be three days' pestilence in thy land? Now advise, and see what answer I
   shall return to him that sent me.

   mercies are great; and let me not fall into the hand of man.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from
  the morning even to the time appointed; and there died of the people from
  Dan even to Beer-Sheba seventy thousand men.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And when the angel stretched out his hand upon
  Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD
  </span><under>
   <note><span>repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people. "It is enough: stay now thine hand"</span></note><span>said unto him, "Stay now thine hand, it is enough;" for the people

   Jebusite.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>For David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote the

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD

  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And
  Arunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him; and
  Arunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the
  ground.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>And Arunah said:
  </span><quote><span>
   Wherefore is my Lord the king come to his servant?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And David said:
  </span><quote><span>
   To buy the threshing floor of thee, to build an altar unto the LORD, that
   the plague may be stayed from the people.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>And Araunah said unto David:</span><quote><span>
   Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him; behold,
   here be oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other
   instruments of the oxen for wood.
  </span></quote>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>All these things did Arunah, as a king, give unto the king. And Araunah

  <verse>24</verse><span>And the king said unto Arunah:</span><quote><span>
   Nay; but I will surely buy it of thee at a price; neither will I offer

  <verse>10</verse><span>So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.

  Solomon's throne established

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom
  was established greatly.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bath-Sheba the mother of
  Solomon. And she said, "Comest thou peaceably?" And he said,
  "Peaceably."
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>He said moreover, "I have somewhat to say unto thee." And she said,
  "Say on."
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>And he said:</span><quote><span>
   Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their
   faces on me, that I should reign; howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and
   is become my brother's; for it was his from the LORD.
   </span><verse>16</verse><span>And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me
   not.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And she said unto him, "Say on."
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And he said;
  </span><quote><span>
   Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he will not say thee nay)
   that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>And Bath-Sheba said, "Well; I will speak for thee unto the king."
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>Bath-Sheba
  therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the
  king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his
  throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on
  his right hand.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>Then she said:
  </span><quote><span>
   I desire one small petition of thee; I pray thee, say me not nay.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And the king said unto her, "Ask on, my mother; for I will not say thee
  nay."
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>And she said, "Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy
  brother to wife."
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother:</span><quote><span>
   And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Ask for him the
   kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar
   the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying:</span><quote><span>
   God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word
   against his own life.
   </span><verse>24</verse><span>Now therefore, as the
   LORD liveth, which hath established me, and set me on the throne of David
   my father, and who hath made me a house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be
   put to death this day.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>25</verse><span>And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and
  he fell upon him that he died.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>26</verse><span>And unto Abiathar the priest said the king:</span><quote><span>
   Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death;
   but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark
   of the Lord GOD before David my father, and because thou hast been
   afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>27</verse><span>So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD; that he
  might fulfill the word of the LORD, which he spake concerning the house
  of Eli in Shiloh.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>28</verse><span>Then tidings came to Joab; for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though
  he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the
  LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.
  </span><verse>29</verse><span>And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the
  tabernacle
  of the LORD; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah
  the son of Jehoiada, saying, "Go, fall upon him."
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>30</verse><span>And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto him:
  </span><quote><span>Thus
  saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here.</span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, "Thus said Joab, and thus
  he answered me."
  </span><verse>31</verse><span>And the king said unto him:
  </span><quote><span>
   Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take
   away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of
   my father.
   </span><verse>32</verse><span>And the LORD shall return his blood
   upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than
   he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing thereof, to
   wit, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the
   son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.
   </span><verse>33</verse><span>Their blood shall therefore return upon the
   head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed forever; but upon David, and
   upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be
   peace forever from the LORD.
  </span></quote>

 <block>
  <verse>34</verse><span>So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew
  him; and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.
  </span><verse>35</verse><span>And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host;
  and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>36</verse><span>And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   Build thee a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence
   any whither.
   </span><verse>37</verse><span>For it shall be, that on the day
   thou goest out, and passest over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for
   certain that thou shalt surely die; thy blood shall be upon thine own
   head.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>38</verse><span>And Shimei said unto the king:</span><quote><span>
   The saying is good; as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>39</verse><span>And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants
  of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And they
  told Shimei, saying, "Behold, thy servants be in Gath."
  </span><verse>40</verse><span>And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to
  seek his servants; and Shimei went, and brought his servants from
  Gath.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>41</verse><span>And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath,
  and was come again.
  </span><verse>42</verse><span>And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto thee, saying,
   "Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any
   whither, that thou shalt surely die?" And thou saidst unto me, "The word
   that I have heard is good."
   </span><verse>43</verse><span>Why then hast thou
   not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment that I have charged
   thee with?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>44</verse><span>The king said moreover to Shimei:</span><quote><span>
   Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to, that thou
   didst to David my father; therefore the LORD shall return thy wickedness
   upon thine own head;
   </span><verse>45</verse><span>and king Solomon shall be
   blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD
   forever.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>46</verse><span>So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went out, and
  fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And the LORD was not pleased with Solomon, for he made affinity with
  Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter to wife, and brought
  her into the house of David until he had made an end of building his own
  house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.
  And the LORD blessed Solomon for the people's sake only.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house
  built unto the name of the LORD, until those days.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>And because the LORD blessed Solomon as he was walking in the statutes
  of David, his father, he began to love the LORD, and he sacrificed and
  burnt incense in high places, and he called on the name of the LORD.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, for Gibeon was in a
  great high place; and Solomon offered upon that altar, in Gibeon, a
  thousand burnt offerings.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And the LORD hearkened unto Solomon, and appeared unto him in a dream
  by night, and said:</span><quote><span>
   Ask what I shall give thee.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And Solomon said:</span><quote><span>
   Thou hast showed unto thy servant David, my father, great things according
   to thy mercy when he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness,
   and in uprighteousness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this
   great kindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne this
   day.
   </span><verse>7</verse><span>And now, O Lord my God, thou hast made thy
   servant king, instead of David, my father, over thy people.
   </span><verse>8</verse><span>And I know not how to lead them, to go out, or
   come in before them, and I, thy servant, am as a little child, in the
   midst of thy people whom thou hast chosen, a great people that cannot be
   numbered, nor counted for multitude.
   </span><verse>9</verse><span>Give
   therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I
   may discern between good and bad; for who is able to judge this thy
   people, so great a people?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>And the speech pleased the LORD, that Solomon had asked this thing.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And God said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long
   life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of
   thine enemies; but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern
   judgment;
   </span><verse>12</verse><span>behold, I have done according to thy
   word; lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that
   there was none made king over Israel like unto thee before thee, neither
   after thee shall any arise like unto thee.
   </span><verse>13</verse><span>And
   I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches, and
   honor; so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all
   thy days.
   </span><verse>14</verse><span>And if thou wilt walk in my ways to
   keep my statutes, and my commandments, then I will lengthen thy days, and
   thou shalt not walk in unrighteousness, as did thy father David.
  </span></quote>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream. And he came to
  Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and
  offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a
  feast to all his servants.

   <block><span>
    O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a

    </span><verse>18</verse><span>And it came to

  <verse>22</verse><span>And the other woman said, "Nay; but the living is my son, and the dead

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>Then said the king, "The one saith, 'This is my son that liveth, and

  </span><verse>24</verse><span>And the king said, "Bring me a sword." And they brought a sword before

  <verse>26</verse><span>Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king, for her

  neither mine nor thine, but divide it."
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>Then the king answered and said, "Give her the living child, and in no

 <chapter>5
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard
  that they had anointed him king in the room of his father; for Hiram was
  ever a lover of David.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying:
  </span><quote>
   <block>
    <verse>3</verse><span>Thou knowest how that David my father could not build a house unto the
    name of the LORD his God, for the wars which were about him on every
    side, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet.
    </span><verse>4</verse><span>But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side, so that there
    is neither adversary nor evil occurrent.
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>And, behold, I purpose to build a house unto the name of the LORD my
    God, as the LORD spake unto David my father, saying, "Thy son, whom I
    will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build a house unto my
    name."</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>6</verse><span>Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon;
    and my servants shall be with thy servants; and unto thee will I give
    hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint; for thou
    knowest that there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like
    unto the Sidonians.</span></block>

  </quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he
  rejoiced greatly, and said, "Blessed be the LORD this day, which hath
  given unto David a wise son over this great people."
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying:</span><quote><span>
   I have considered the things which thou sentest to me for; and I will do
   all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.
   </span><verse>9</verse><span>My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon
   unto the sea; and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that

   thou shalt receive them; and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving
   food for my household.

  Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his
  household, and
  twenty measures of pure oil; thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.

  they were in Lebanon, and two months at home; and Adoniram was over the

  year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month of Zif, which is the
  second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length thereof
  was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, the height
  thereof thirty cubits.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the
  length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits
  was the breadth thereof before the house.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about,
  against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of
  the oracle; and he made chambers round about.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was six
  cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad; for without in the
  wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams
  should not be fastened in the walls of the house.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready

  </span><verse>9</verse><span>So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with
  beams and boards of cedar.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high; and
  they rested on the house with timber of cedar.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying:</span><quote>
   <verse>12</verse><span>Concerning this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in
   my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to
   walk in them; then will I perform my word with thee which I spake unto
   David thy father;
   </span><verse>13</verse><span>and I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my
   people Israel.</span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>So Solomon built the house, and finished it.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both
  the floor of the house, and the walls of the ceiling; and he covered
  them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house with
  planks of fir.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor
  and the walls with boards of cedar; he even built them for it within,
  even for the oracle, even for the most holy place.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits long.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open
  flowers; all was cedar; there was no stone seen.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And the oracle he prepared
  in the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And the oracle in the forepart was twenty
  cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the
  height thereof; and he overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the
  altar which was of cedar.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>So Solomon overlaid
  the house within with pure gold; and he made a partition by the chains of
  gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>And the whole house he overlaid with gold,
  until he had finished all the house; also the whole altar that was by the
  oracle he overlaid with gold.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>And within the oracle he made two cherubim of olive tree, each ten
  cubits high.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing
  of the cherub; from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost
  part of the other were ten cubits.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>And the
  other cherub was ten cubits; both the cherubim were of one measure and one
  size.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>The height of one cherub was ten cubits,
  and so was it of the other cherub.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>27</verse><span>And he set the cherubim within the inner house; and they stretched
  forth the wings of the cherubim, so that the wing of the one touched the
  one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and
  their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>And he overlaid the cherubim with gold.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>29</verse><span>And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved
  figures of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, within and without.
  </span><verse>30</verse><span>And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and
  without.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>31</verse><span>And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree; the
  lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.
  </span><verse>32</verse><span>The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings
  of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with
  gold, and spread gold upon the cherubim, and upon the palm trees.
  </span><verse>33</verse><span>So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree, a
  fourth part of the wall.
  </span><verse>34</verse><span>And the two doors were of fir tree; the two leaves of the one door were
  folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.
  </span><verse>35</verse><span>And he carved thereon cherubim and palm trees and open flowers; and
  covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work.
  </span><verse>36</verse><span>And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a row
  of cedar beams.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>37</verse><span>In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid, in
  the month Zif;
  </span><verse>38</verse><span>and in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month,
  was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according
  to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it.

 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house.</span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof
  was a hundred cubits,
  and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty
  cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the
  pillars.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And it was covered with cedar above
  upon the beams, that lay on forty-five pillars, fifteen in a row.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And there were windows in three rows, and light
  was against light in three ranks.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And all the
  doors and posts were square, with the windows; and light was against light
  in three ranks.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty cubits,
  and the breadth thereof thirty cubits; and the porch was before them;
  and the other pillars and the thick beam were before them.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even the
  porch of judgment; and it was covered with cedar from one side of the
  floor to the other.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>And his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch, which
  was of the like work. Solomon made also a house for Pharaoh's daughter,
  whom he had taken to wife, like unto his porch.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>All these were of costly stones, according to the measure of hewed
  stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation
  unto the coping, and so on the outside toward the great court.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of
  ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And above were costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones, and
  cedars.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And the great court round about was with three rows of hewed stones,
  and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the
  LORD, and for the porch of the house.

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>He was a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man
  of Tyre, a worker in brass; and he was filled with wisdom, and
  understanding, and cunning to work all works in brass. And he came to
  king Solomon, and wrought all his work.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>For he cast two pillars of brass of eighteen cubits high apiece; and a
  line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And he made two chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the
  pillars; the height of the one chapiter was five cubits, and the height
  of the other chapiter was five cubits;
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>and nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the chapiters
  which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one chapiter, and
  seven for the other chapiter.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one network,
  to cover the chapiters that were upon the top, with pomegranates; and so
  did he for the other chapiter.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily
  work in the porch, four cubits.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above,
  over against the belly which was by the network; and the pomegranates
  were two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple; and he set up the
  right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin; and he set up the left
  pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>And upon the top of the pillars was lily work; so was the work of the
  pillars finished.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other; it
  was round all about, and his height was five cubits; and a line of
  thirty cubits did compass it round about.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>And under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing it,
  ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about; the knops were cast in
  two rows, when it was cast.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three
  looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three
  looking toward the east; and the sea was set above upon them, and all
  their hinder parts were inward.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>And it was a handbreath thick, and the brim thereof was wrought like
  the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies; it contained two thousand
  baths.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>27</verse><span>And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base,
  and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it.
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>And the work of the bases was on this manner; they had borders, and the
  borders were between the ledges;
  </span><verse>29</verse><span>and on the borders that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and
  cherubim; and upon the ledges there was a base above; and beneath the
  lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work.
  </span><verse>30</verse><span>And every base had four brazen wheels, and plates of brass; and the
  four corners thereof had under-setters; under the laver were
  under-setters molten, at the side of every addition.
  </span><verse>31</verse><span>And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit; but the
  mouth thereof was round after the work of the base, a cubit and a half;
  and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with their borders,
  foursquare, not round.
  </span><verse>32</verse><span>And under the borders
  were four wheels; and the axletrees of the wheels were joined to the base;
  and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit.
  </span><verse>33</verse><span>And the work of the wheels was like the work
  of a chariot wheel; their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes,
  and their spokes, were all molten.
  </span><verse>34</verse><span>And there
  were four under-setters to the four corners of one base; and the
  undersetters were of the very base itself.
  </span><verse>35</verse><span>And
  in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high; and
  on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the border thereof were of
  the same.
  </span><verse>36</verse><span>For on the plates of the ledges
  thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved cherubim, lions, and palm
  trees, according to the proportion of every one, and additions round
  about.
  </span><verse>37</verse><span>After this manner he made the ten
  bases; all of them had one casting, one measure, and one size.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>38</verse><span>Then made he ten lavers of brass; one laver contained forty baths; and
  every laver was four cubits; and upon every one of the ten bases one
  laver.
  </span><verse>39</verse><span>And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the
  left side of the house; and he set the sea on the right side of the
  house eastward, over against the south.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>40</verse><span>And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram
  made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the
  house of the LORD.
  </span><verse>41</verse><span>The two pillars, and the two bowls of the chapiters that were on the
  top of the two pillars; and the two networks, to cover the two bowls of
  the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars;
  </span><verse>42</verse><span>and four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, even two rows of
  pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters
  that were upon the pillars;
  </span><verse>43</verse><span>and the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases;
  </span><verse>44</verse><span>and one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;
  </span><verse>45</verse><span>and the pots, and the shovels, and the basins; and all these vessels,
  which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the LORD, were of
  bright brass.
  </span><verse>46</verse><span>In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground
  between Succoth and Zarthan.
  </span><verse>47</verse><span>And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding
  many; neither was the weight of the brass found out.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>48</verse><span>And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the
  LORD; the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the showbread
  was.
  </span><verse>49</verse><span>And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side, and five on
  the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the
  tongs of gold.
  </span><verse>50</verse><span>And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and
  the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of
  the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, to
  wit, of the temple.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>51</verse><span>So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the
  LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had
  dedicated; even the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, did he put
  among the treasures of the house of the LORD.

  <verse>1</verse><span>Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the
  tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto king
  Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the covenant
  of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the
  feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of the
  congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, even
  those did the priests and the Levites bring up.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were
  assembled unto him, where with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and
  oxen that could not be told nor numbered for multitude.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his
  place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under
  the wings of the cherubim.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>For the cherubim spread forth their two
  wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the
  staves thereof above.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>And they drew out the
  staves, that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before
  the oracle, and they were not seen without; and there they are unto this
  day.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>There was nothing in the ark save the two
  tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a
  covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of
  Egypt.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And it came to pass, when the priests
  were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the
  LORD.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>So that the priests could not stand to
  minister because of the cloud; for the glory of the LORD had filled the
  house of the LORD.

  Solomon's benediction

  <verse>54</verse><span>And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this
  prayer and supplication unto the LORD, he arose from before the altar of
  the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven.
  </span><verse>55</verse><span>And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud
  voice, saying:</span><quote>
   <verse>56</verse><span>Blessed be the LORD, that hath given rest unto his people Israel,
   according to all that he promised; there hath not failed one word of all
   his good promise, which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant.
   </span><verse>57</verse><span>The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers; let him not
   leave us, nor forsake us;
   </span><verse>58</verse><span>that he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and
   to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, which he
   commanded our fathers.
   </span><verse>59</verse><span>And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before the
   LORD, be nigh unto the LORD our God day and night, that he maintain the
   cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel at all times,
   as the matter shall require;
   </span><verse>60</verse><span>that all the people of the earth may know that the LORD is God, and
   that there is none else.
   </span><verse>61</verse><span>Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to walk in
   his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.</span></quote>

  <verse>62</verse><span>And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the
  LORD.
  </span><verse>63</verse><span>And
  Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings which he offered unto the
  LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand
  sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of
  the LORD.
  </span><verse>64</verse><span>The same day did the king hallow the
  middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD; for there he
  offered burnt offerings, and meat offering, and the fat of the peace
  offerings; because the brazen altar that was before the LORD was too
  little to receive the burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of
  the peace offerings.

  <verse>65</verse><span>And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great

  </span><verse>66</verse><span>On the eighth day he sent the people away; and they blessed the king,

    I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication, that thou hast made before

    this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my

    </span><verse>8</verse><span>and at this house, which is high, every one that passeth by it shall be
    astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, "Why hath the LORD done

  Israel, "Ye shall not go in to them, neither shall they come in unto

  Solomon clave unto these in love.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred
  concubines; and his wives turned away his heart.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, his wives turned away his
  heart after other gods; and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his
  God, and it became as the heart of David his father.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and
  after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.

  the LORD, as did David his father.

  <verse>14</verse><span>And the LORD stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite;

  </span><verse>15</verse><span>For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of
  the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male
  in Edom;
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>(for six months did Joab remain there with all Israel, until he had cut
  off every male in Edom)
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>that Hadad fled, he and certain
  Edomites of his father's servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad being
  yet a little child.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>And they arose out of
  Midian, and came to Paran; and they took men with them out of Paran, and
  they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh king of Egypt; which gave him a house,
  and appointed him victuals, and gave him land.

  <verse>19</verse><span>And Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave

  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes
  weaned in Pharaoh's house; and Genubath was in Pharaoh's household among
  the sons of Pharaoh.

  <verse>21</verse><span>And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and
  that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, "Let

  </span><verse>22</verse><span>Then Pharaoh said unto him, "But what hast thou lacked with me, that,
  behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country?" And he answered,
  "Nothing; howbeit let me go in any wise."

  <verse>23</verse><span>And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah,

  David slew them of Zobah; and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein,

    my servant may have a light always before me in Jerusalem, the city which

    <verse>1</verse><span>Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in

    years.
    </span><verse>2</verse><span>And he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his father,
    and like his mother; for he put away the image of Baal that his father
    had made.
    </span><verse>3</verse><span>Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
    which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.

    </span><verse>6</verse><span>And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered all
    Israel.
    </span><verse>7</verse><span>And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, "The
    king of Moab hath rebelled against me; wilt thou go with me against Moab
    to battle?" And he said, "I will go up; I am as thou art, my people as

    servants answered and said, "Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, which
    poured water on the hands of Elijah."

    </span><verse>3</verse><span>And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him, and he
    was wounded of the archers.
    </span><verse>4</verse><span>Then said Saul to his armor-bearer, "Draw thy sword, and thrust me
    through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me." But his
    armor-bearer would not; for he was sore afraid. So Saul took a sword and
    fell upon it.
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>And when his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise on

    the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa.
    </span><verse>9</verse><span>And when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his armor, and
    sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry tidings unto
    their idols, and to the people.
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>And they put his armor in the house of their gods and fastened his head

      beginning.
      </span><verse>10</verse><span>And since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel.
      Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies.</span></block>

      Furthermore I tell thee, that the LORD will build thee a house.
      </span><verse>11</verse><span>And it shall come to pass when thy days be
      expired that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy
      seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his
      kingdom.
      </span><verse>12</verse><span>He shall build me a house, and I will
      stablish his throne forever.
      </span><verse>13</verse><span>I will be his

      Who am I, O LORD God, and what is mine house, that thou hast brought me
      hitherto?
      </span><verse>17</verse><span>And yet this was a small thing in

    <verse>1</verse><span>And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel.
    </span><verse>2</verse><span>And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people:</span><quote><span>
     Go, number Israel from Beer-Sheba even to Dan; and bring the number of
     them to me, that I may know it.
    </span></quote>

   <block>
    <verse>3</verse><span>And Joab answered:</span><quote><span>
     The LORD make his people a hundred times so many more as they be; but, my
     lord the king, are they not all my lord's servants? Why then doth my lord
     require this thing? Why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel?
    </span></quote>
   </block>

   <block>
    <verse>4</verse><span>Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab
    departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And all
    they of Israel were a thousand and a hundred thousand men
    that drew sword; and Judah was four hundred three-score and ten thousand
    men that drew sword.
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>But Levi and Benjamin
    counted he not among them; for the king's word was abominable to Joab.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>7</verse><span>And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel.
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>And David said unto God:</span><quote><span>
     I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing; but now, I beseech
     thee, do away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.

    <verse>9</verse><span>And the LORD spake unto Gad, David's seer, saying:</span><quote>
     <verse>10</verse><span>Go and tell David, saying, "Thus saith the LORD: I offer thee three
     things; choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee."</span></quote>
   </block>

   <block>
    <verse>11</verse><span>So Gad came to David, and said unto him:
    </span><quote>
     <block><span>
      Thus saith the LORD: Choose thee
      </span><verse>12</verse><span>either three
      years' famine; or three months to be destroyed before thy foes, while that
      the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee; or else three days the sword
      of the LORD, even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the LORD
      destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel.
     </span></block>

     <block><span>
      Now therefore advise thyself what word I shall bring again to him that
      sent me.

    <verse>13</verse><span>And David said unto Gad:</span><quote><span>
     I am in a great strait; let me fall now into the hand of the LORD; for
     very great are his mercies; but let me not fall into the hand of man.
    </span></quote>

   <block>
    <verse>14</verse><span>So the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel; and there fell of Israel
    seventy thousand men.
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it. And the angel
    stretched forth his hand unto Jerusalem to destroy it; and God said to
    the angel, "Stay now thine hand, it is enough;" for as he was
    destroying, the LORD beheld Israel, that he repented him of the evil;
    therefore the LORD stayed the angel that destroyed, as he stood by the
    threshing floor of Ornan, the Jebusite.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>16</verse><span>And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD stand
    between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand
    stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders of Israel, who
    were clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.
    </span><verse>17</verse><span>And David said unto God:</span><quote><span>
     Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? Even I it is that
     have sinned and done evil indeed; but as for these sheep, what have they
     done? Let thine hand I pray thee, O LORD my God, be on me, and on my
     father's house; but not on thy people, that they should be plagued.
    </span></quote>

   <block>
    <verse>18</verse><span>Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that David
    should go up, and set up an altar unto the LORD in the threshing floor
    of Ornan the Jebusite.
    </span><verse>19</verse><span>And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of
    the LORD.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>20</verse><span>Now Ornan was threshing wheat, and his four sons with him; and Ornan
    turned back and saw the angel, and they hid themselves.
    </span><verse>21</verse><span>And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of
    the threshing floor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the
    ground.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>22</verse><span>Then David said to Ornan:</span><quote><span>
     Grant me the place of this threshing floor, that I may build an altar
     therein unto the LORD; thou shalt grant it me for the full price; that the
     plague may be stayed from the people.
    </span></quote>
   </block>

   <block>
    <verse>23</verse><span>And Ornan said unto David:</span><quote><span>
     Take it to thee, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his
     eyes; lo, I give thee the oxen also for burnt offerings, and the threshing
     instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I give it all.
    </span></quote>
   </block>

   <block>
    <verse>24</verse><span>And king David said to Ornan:</span><quote><span>
     Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price; for I will not take that
     which is thine for the LORD, nor offer burnt offerings without cost.
    </span></quote>
   </block>

   <block>
    <verse>25</verse><span>So David gave to Ornan for the place

    </span><verse>26</verse><span>And
    David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and
    peace offerings, and called upon the LORD; and he answered him from heaven
    by fire upon the altar of burnt offering.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>27</verse><span>And the LORD commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into
    the sheath thereof.
    </span><verse>28</verse><span>At that time when David saw that the LORD had answered him in the
    threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.
    </span><verse>29</verse><span>For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the wilderness, and
    the altar of the burnt offering, were at that season in the high place
    at Gibeon.
    </span><verse>30</verse><span>But David could not go before it to inquire of God; for he was afraid
    because of the sword of the angel of the LORD.

    <verse>1</verse><span>Then David said:</span><quote><span>

    <verse>2</verse><span>And David commanded to gather together the strangers that were in the
    land of Israel, and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the
    house of God.
    </span><verse>3</verse><span>And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the
    gates, and for the joinings; and brass in abundance without weight;

      My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build a house unto the name of the

      </span><verse>8</verse><span>But the word of the LORD came to
      me, saying, "Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars;
      thou shalt not build a house unto my name, because thou hast shed much
      blood upon the earth in my sight.
      </span><verse>9</verse><span>Behold, a son
      shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him

      </span><verse>13</verse><span>Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfill the

    <verse>2</verse><span>And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the

    </span><verse>3</verse><span>Now
    the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward; and
    their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight
    thousand.
    </span><verse>4</verse><span>Of which, twenty and four
    thousand were to set forward the work of the house of the LORD; and
    six thousand were officers and judges;

    These four were the sons of Shimei.
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second; but Jeush and

   <block>
    <verse>27</verse><span>For by the last words of David the Levites were numbered from
    twenty years old and above;
    </span><verse>28</verse><span>because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the
    service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, and in the
    chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the work of
    the service of the house of God;

    Of the Korhites was Meshelemiah the son of Kore, of the sons of Asaph.
    </span><verse>2</verse><span>And the sons of
    Meshelemiah were, Zechariah the first-born, Jediael the second, Zebadiah

    </span><verse>5</verse><span>Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh, Peulthai the eighth; for God
    blessed him.
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>Also unto Shemaiah his son were sons born, that ruled throughout the
    house of their father; for they were mighty men of valor.
    </span><verse>7</verse><span>The sons of Shemaiah; Othni, and Rephael, and Obed, Elzabad, whose
    brethren were strong men, Elihu, and Semachiah.
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>All these of the sons of Obed-Edom; they and their sons and their
    brethren, able men for strength for the service, were threescore and two
    of Obed-Edom.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>9</verse><span>And Meshelemiah had sons and brethren, strong men, eighteen.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>10</verse><span>Also Hosah, of the children of Merari, had sons; Simri the chief, (for
    though he was not the first­born,yet his father made him the chief)
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third, Zechariah the fourth; all the
    sons and brethren of Hosah were thirteen.

   <block>
    <verse>12</verse><span>Among these were the divisions of the porters, even among the chief
    men, having wards one against another, to minister in the house of the
    LORD.
    </span><verse>13</verse><span>And they cast lots, as well the small as the great, according to the
    house of their fathers, for every gate.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>14</verse><span>And the lot eastward fell to Shelemiah. Then for Zechariah his son, a
    wise counselor, they cast lots; and his lot came out northward.
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>To Obed-Edom southward; and to his sons the house of Asuppim.
    </span><verse>16</verse><span>To Shuppim and Hosah the lot came forth westward, with the gate
    Shallecheth, by the causeway of the going up, ward against ward.
    </span><verse>17</verse><span>Eastward were six Levites, northward four a day, southward four a day,
    and toward Asuppim two and two.
    </span><verse>18</verse><span>At Parbar westward, four at the causeway, and two at Parbar.

    treasures.
    </span><verse>25</verse><span>And his brethren by Eliezer; Rehabiah his son, and Jeshaiah his son,
    and Joram his son, and Zichri his son, and Shelomith his son;
    </span><verse>26</verse><span>which Shelomith and his brethren were over all the treasures of the
    dedicated things, which David the king, and the chief fathers, the
    captains over thousands and hundreds, and the captains of the host, had
    dedicated.
    </span><verse>27</verse><span>Out of the spoils won in battles did they dedicate to maintain the
    house of the LORD.
    </span><verse>28</verse><span>And all that Samuel the seer, and Saul the son of Kish, and Abner the
    son of Ner, and Joab the son of Zeruiah, had dedicated; and whosoever
    had dedicated anything, it was under the hand of Shelomith, and of his

    of the king.
    </span><verse>31</verse><span>Among the Hebronites was Jerijah the chief, even among the Hebronites,

    reign of David they were sought for, and there were found among them
    mighty men of valor at Jazer of Gilead.
    </span><verse>32</verse><span>And his brethren, men of valor, were two thousand and seven hundred
    chief fathers, whom king David made rulers over the Reubenites, the

    white linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east
    end of the altar, and with them a hundred and twenty priests sounding

    </span><verse>13</verse><span>it came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as one, to
    make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the LORD; and when
    they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments

     thus shalt thou say unto them, "My little finger shall be thicker than my

     </span><verse>11</verse><span>For whereas my father put a

     They have humbled themselves; therefore I will not destroy them, but I
     will grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out
     upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.

     Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; The LORD is with you, while
     ye be with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye
     forsake him, he will forsake you.

    killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that he

    <verse>7</verse><span>But there came a man of God to him, saying:</span><quote><span>
     O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee; for the LORD is not with
     Israel, to wit, with all the children of Ephraim.
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>But if thou wilt go, do it, be strong for the

    <verse>10</verse><span>Then Amaziah separated them, to wit, the army that was come to him out

    against Judah, and they returned home in great anger.
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went to
    the valley of salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten
    thousand.
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>And other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah carry away

    <verse>14</verse><span>Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of

    them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned
    incense unto them.
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah, and he
    sent unto him a prophet, which said unto him:</span><quote><span>
     Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which could not deliver
     their own people out of thine hand?

   <block>
    <verse>17</verse><span>Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of

    <verse>18</verse><span>And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, "The

    </span><verse>19</verse><span>Thou sayest, 'Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thine heart

     It appertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the LORD, but

    </span><verse>20</verse><span>And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon him,

    together into the east street.
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>And said unto them:</span><quote><span>
     Hear me, ye Levites; sanctify now yourselves, and sanctify the house of
     the LORD God of your fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the
     holy place.
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>For our fathers have trespassed,
     and done that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD our God, and have
     forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the
     LORD, and turned their backs.
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>Also they have
     shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned
     incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place unto the God of
     Israel.
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>Wherefore the wrath of the LORD was
     upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he hath delivered them to trouble, to
     astonishment, and to hissing, as ye see with your eyes.
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword,
     and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>Now it is in mine heart to make a covenant
     with the LORD God of Israel, that his fierce wrath may turn away from us.
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>My sons, be not now negligent; for the LORD
     hath chosen you to stand before him, to serve him, and that ye should
     minister unto him, and burn incense.

    cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the

    </span><verse>17</verse><span>Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify, and on
    the eighty day of the month came they to the porch of the LORD; so they
    sanctified the house of the LORD in eight days; and in the sixteenth day

     the vessels thereof.
     </span><verse>19</verse><span>Moreover all the vessels,

    </span><verse>21</verse><span>And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and
    seven he goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom, and for the
    sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron
    to offer them on the altar of the LORD.
    </span><verse>22</verse><span>So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and
    sprinkled it on the altar; likewise, when they had killed the rams, they
    sprinkled the blood upon the altar; they killed also the lambs, and they
    sprinkled the blood upon the altar.
    </span><verse>23</verse><span>And they brought forth the he goats for the sin offering before the

    </span><verse>24</verse><span>and the priests killed them, and they made
    reconciliation with their blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for
    all Israel; for the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin
    offering should be made for all Israel.

    <verse>25</verse><span>And he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, with

   <block><span>
    And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as
    many as were of a free heart, burnt offerings.
    </span><verse>32</verse><span>And the number of the burnt offerings, which
    the congregation brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, a hundred rams,
    and two hundred lambs; all these were for a burnt offering to the LORD.
    </span><verse>33</verse><span>And the consecrated things were six hundred
    oxen and three thousand sheep.
    </span><verse>34</verse><span>But the priests
    were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings;
    wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was
    ended, and until the other priests had sanctified themselves; for the
    Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the
    priests.
    </span><verse>35</verse><span>And also the burnt offerings were in
    abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings, and the drink offerings
    for every burnt offering. So the service of the house of the LORD was set
    in order.

    <verse>1</verse><span>And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to
    Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at
    Jerusalem, to keep the Passover unto the LORD God of Israel.
    </span><verse>2</verse><span>For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the
    congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the Passover in the second month.
    </span><verse>3</verse><span>For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not
    sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people gathered
    themselves together to Jerusalem.
    </span><verse>4</verse><span>And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation.
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all
    Israel, from Beer-Sheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the
    Passover unto the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem; for they had not done
    it of a long time in such sort as it was written.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>6</verse><span>So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes
    throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the
    king, saying:</span><quote><span>
     Ye children of Israel, turn again unto the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and
     Israel, and he will return to the remnant of you, that are escaped out of
     the hand of the kings of Assyria.
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>And be not ye
     like your fathers, and like your brethren, which trespassed against the
     LORD God of their fathers, who therefore gave them up to desolation, as ye
     see.
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>Now be ye not stiff-necked, as your
     fathers were, but yield yourselves unto the LORD, and enter into his
     sanctuary, which he hath sanctified forever; and serve the LORD your God,
     that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you.
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>For if ye turn again unto the LORD, your
     brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that lead
     them captive, so that they shall come again into this land; for the LORD
     your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from
     you, if ye return unto him.

    <verse>10</verse><span>So the posts passed from city to city, through the country of Ephraim
    and Manasseh, even unto Zebulun; but they laughed them to scorn, and
    mocked them.
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>Nevertheless, divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled
    themselves, and came to Jerusalem.
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the

    the altars for incense took they away, and cast them into the brook
    Kidron.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>15</verse><span>Then they killed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the second

    LORD.
    </span><verse>16</verse><span>And they stood in their places after their manner, according to the law
    of Moses the man of God; the priests sprinkled the blood, which they
    received of the hand of the Levites.
    </span><verse>17</verse><span>For there were many in the congregation that were not sanctified;
    therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the Passovers for
    everyone that was not clean, to sanctify them unto the LORD.
    </span><verse>18</verse><span>For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim and Manasseh,
    Issachar and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the
    Passover otherwise than it was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them,
    saying:</span><quote><span>
     The good LORD pardon everyone
     </span><verse>19</verse><span>that prepareth
     his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his fathers, though he be not
     cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary.

   <block>
    <verse>21</verse><span>And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the
    feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness; and the
    Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, singing with loud
    instruments unto the LORD.
    </span><verse>22</verse><span>And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught the
    good knowledge of the LORD; and they did eat throughout the feast seven
    days, offering peace offerings, and making confession to the LORD God of
    their fathers.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>23</verse><span>And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days; and they
    kept other seven days with gladness.
    </span><verse>24</verse><span>For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a thousand
    bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the
    congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep; and a great
    number of priests sanctified themselves.
    </span><verse>25</verse><span>And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites,
    and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that
    came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.
    </span><verse>26</verse><span>So there was great joy in Jerusalem; for since the time of Solomon the

    give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the tents of the LORD.
    </span><verse>3</verse><span>He appointed also the king's portion of his substance for the burnt

    <verse>27</verse><span>And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honor; and he made himself

    stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks.
    </span><verse>29</verse><span>Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in

    <verse>30</verse><span>This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper water course of Gihon, and

    <verse>1</verse><span>Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
    fifty and five years in Jerusalem;
    </span><verse>2</verse><span>but did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, like unto the
    abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD had cast out before the
    children of Israel.
    </span><verse>3</verse><span>For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken
    down, and he reared up altars for Baalim, and made groves, and worshiped
    all the host of heaven, and served them.
    </span><verse>4</verse><span>Also he built altars in the house of the LORD, whereof the LORD had
    said, In Jerusalem shall my name be forever.
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the
    house of the LORD.
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of
    the son of Hinnom; also he observed times, and used enchantments,
    and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards; he
    wrought much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>7</verse><span>And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house of
    God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son:</span><quote><span>
     In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen before all the tribes
     of Israel, will I put my name forever.
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>Neither

    <verse>10</verse><span>And the LORD spake to Manasseh, and to the people; but they would not

    </span><verse>11</verse><span>Wherefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of the host of the
    king of Assyria, which took Manasseh among the thorns, and bound him
    with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>And when he was in affliction, he besought the LORD his God, and
    humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers,
    </span><verse>13</verse><span>and prayed unto him; and he was entreated of him, and heard his
    supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then
    Manasseh knew that the LORD he was God.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>14</verse><span>Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on the west
    side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in at the Fish Gate,
    and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great height, and put
    captains of war in all the fenced cities of Judah.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>15</verse><span>And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of the
    LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of
    the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.
    </span><verse>16</verse><span>And he repaired the altar of the LORD, and sacrificed thereon peace
    offerings and thank offerings, and commanded Judah to serve the LORD God
    of Israel.
    </span><verse>17</verse><span>Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places, yet
    unto the LORD their God only.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>18</verse><span>Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God, and

    Dedication of the wall of Jerusalem

   <block>
    <verse>27</verse><span>And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites
    out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep the
    dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with singing,
    with cymbals, psalteries, and with harps.
    </span><verse>28</verse><span>And the sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both out of
    the plain country round about Jerusalem, and from the villages of
    Netophathi;
    </span><verse>29</verse><span>also from the house of Gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba and
    Azmaveth; for the singers had builded them villages round about
    Jerusalem;
    </span><verse>30</verse><span>and the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and purified the
    people, and the gates, and the wall.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>31</verse><span>Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and appointed two
    great companies of them that gave thanks, whereof one went on the right
    hand upon the wall toward the Dung Gate;
    </span><verse>32</verse><span>and after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah,
    </span><verse>33</verse><span>And Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,
    </span><verse>34</verse><span>Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,

    man of God, and Ezra the scribe before them.
    </span><verse>37</verse><span>And at the Fountain Gate, which was over against them, they went up by
    the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of the wall, above the
    house of David, even unto the Water Gate eastward.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>38</verse><span>And the other company of them that gave thanks went over against them,

    </span><verse>39</verse><span>and from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate, and above
    the Fish Gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Meah, even
    unto the Sheep Gate; and they stood still in the Prison Gate.

    <verse>40</verse><span>So stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house of

    their overseer.
    </span><verse>43</verse><span>Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and
    rejoiced; for God had made them rejoice with great joy; the wives also and
    the children rejoiced; so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar
    off.

    gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the law
    for the priests and Levites; for Judah rejoiced for the priests, and for
    the Levites that waited.
    </span><verse>45</verse><span>And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their God, and
    the ward of the purification, according to the commandment of David, and
    of Solomon his son.

    singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God.
    </span><verse>47</verse><span>And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah,
    gave the portions of the singers and the porters, every day his portion;

    sanctified them unto the children of Aaron.

    </span><verse>2</verse><span>because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water,
    but hired Baalam against them, that he should curse them; howbeit our

    the meat offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of
    the corn, the new wine, and the oil, which was commanded to be given to
    the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the offerings of the

    for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of
    God.
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>And it grieved me sore; therefore I cast forth all the household stuff

    </span><verse>9</verse><span>Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers; and thither brought I
    again the vessels of the house of God, with the meat offering and the

    forsaken?" And I gathered them together, and set them in their

   <block>
    <verse>12</verse><span>Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the

    Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah; and next to them was

    the king,

      Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the

      Ahasuerus.
      </span><verse>17</verse><span>For this deed of the queen shall
      come abroad unto all women, so that they shall despise their husbands in

      Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not."
      </span><verse>18</verse><span>Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media

    </span><verse>2</verse><span>Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him:</span><quote><span>
     Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king;

   <block><span>
    And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>5</verse><span>Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name was
    Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a
    Benjamite;
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had
    been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the
    king of Babylon had carried away.
    </span><verse>7</verse><span>And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter; for
    she had neither father nor mother, and the maid was fair and beautiful;
    whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took for his own
    daughter.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>8</verse><span>So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree was
    heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the

    king's house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.
    </span><verse>9</verse><span>And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he
    speedily gave her her things for purification, with such things as
    belonged to her, and seven maidens, which were meet to be given her, out
    of the king's house; and he preferred her and her maids unto the best
    place of the house of the women.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>10</verse><span>Esther had not showed her people nor her kindred; for Mordecai had
    charged her that she should not show it.
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house, to
    know how Esther did, and what should become of her.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>12</verse><span>Now when every maid's turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after
    that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women,
    (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, to wit, six
    months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odors, and with
    other things for the purifying of the women)
    </span><verse>13</verse><span>then thus came every maiden unto the king; whatsoever she desired was
    given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king's
    house.
    </span><verse>14</verse><span>In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second
    house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain,
    which kept the concubines; she came in unto the king no more, except the
    king delighted in her, and that she were called by name.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>15</verse><span>Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of
    Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the
    king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the
    keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favor in the sight
    of all them that looked upon her.
    </span><verse>16</verse><span>So Esther was taken unto
    king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month
    Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.

    even Esther's feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave

     apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble
     princes, that they may array the man withal whom the king delighteth to

    <verse>11</verse><span>Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon
    him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and
    Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite; for they had made an
    appointment together to come to mourn with him, and to comfort him.
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they
    lifted up their voice and wept; and they rent everyone his mantle, and
    sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.
    </span><verse>13</verse><span>So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights,
    and none spake a word unto him; for they saw that his grief was very
    great.

  <verse>1</verse><span>So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in
  his own eyes.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>Then
  was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the
  kindred of Ram; against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified
  himself rather than God.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>Also against his three
  friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer; and yet
  had condemned Job.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>Now Elihu had waited till
  Job had spoken, because they were elder than he.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the
  mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite

    <indent><span>neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.</span></indent>

   <block>
    <verse>8</verse><span>Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing,</span><break></break>

    <verse>13</verse><span>Why dost thou strive against him?</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>For he giveth not account of any of his matters.</span></indent>

    <indent><span>yet man perceiveth it not.</span></indent>
    <verse>15</verse><span>In a dream, in a vision of the night,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;</span></indent>
    <verse>16</verse><span>Then he openeth the ears of men,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and sealeth their instruction,</span></indent>
    <verse>17</verse><span>That he may withdraw man from his purpose,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and hide pride from man.</span></indent>
    <verse>18</verse><span>He keeps back his soul from the pit,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and his life from perishing by the sword.</span></indent>
   </block>

   <block>
    <verse>19</verse><span>He is chastened also with pain upon his bed,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and the multitude of his bones with strong pain;</span></indent>
    <verse>20</verse><span>So that his life abhorreth bread,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and his soul dainty meat.</span></indent>
    <verse>21</verse><span>His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen;</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and his bones that were not seen stick out.</span></indent>
    <verse>22</verse><span>Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers.</span><break></break>
    <indent>
     <verse>23</verse><span>If there be a messenger with him,</span></indent>
    <indent><span>an interpreter, one among a thousand,</span></indent>
    <indent><span>to show unto man his uprightness;</span></indent>
    <verse>24</verse><span>Then he is gracious unto him, and saith,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>"Deliver him from going down to the pit;</span></indent>
    <indent><span>I have found a ransom."</span></indent>
    <verse>25</verse><span>His flesh shall be fresher than a child's;</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>he shall return to the days of his youth;</span></indent>
    <verse>26</verse><span>He shall pray unto God, and he will be favorable unto him;</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and he shall see his face with joy;</span></indent><span>
    for he will render unto man his righteousness.</span><break></break>
    <indent>
     <verse>27</verse><span>He looketh upon men, and if any say,</span></indent><span>
    "I have sinned, and perverted that which was right,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and it profited me not;"</span></indent>
    <verse>28</verse><span>He will deliver his soul from going into the pit,</span><break></break>

    <verse>29</verse><span>Lo, all these things worketh God</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>oftentimes with man.</span></indent>
    <verse>30</verse><span>To bring back his soul from the pit,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>to be enlightened with the light of the living.</span></indent>
    <verse>31</verse><span>Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me;</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>hold thy peace, and I will speak.</span></indent>
    <verse>32</verse><span>If thou hast anything to say, answer me;</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>speak, for I desire to justify thee.</span></indent>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Furthermore Elihu answered and said:
  </span><quote>
   <block>
    <verse>2</verse><span>Hear my words, O ye wise men;</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.</span></indent>
    <verse>3</verse><span>For the ear trieth words,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>as the mouth tasteth meat.</span></indent>
    <verse>4</verse><span>Let us choose to us judgment;</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>let us know among ourselves what is good.</span></indent>
    <verse>5</verse><span>For Job hath said, "I am righteous;</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and God hath taken away my judgment.</span></indent>
    <verse>6</verse><span>Should I lie against my right?</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>My wound is incurable without transgression."</span></indent>
    <verse>7</verse><span>What man is like Job,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>who drinketh up scorning like water?</span></indent>
    <verse>8</verse><span>Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and walketh with wicked men.</span></indent>
    <verse>9</verse><span>For he hath said, "It profiteth a man nothing</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>that he should delight himself with God."</span></indent>
   </block>

   <block>
    <verse>10</verse><span>Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding;</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>far be it from God, that he should do wickedness;</span></indent>
    <indent><span>and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.</span></indent>
    <verse>11</verse><span>For the work of a man shall he render unto him,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and cause every man to find according to his ways.</span></indent>
    <verse>12</verse><span>Yea, surely God will not do wickedly,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.</span></indent>
    <verse>13</verse><span>Who hath given him a charge over the earth?</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>Or who hath disposed the whole world?</span></indent>
    <verse>14</verse><span>If he set his heart upon man,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;</span></indent>
    <verse>15</verse><span>All flesh shall perish together,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and man shall turn again unto dust.</span></indent>
   </block>

   <block>
    <verse>16</verse><span>If now thou hast understanding, hear this;</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>hearken to the voice of my words.</span></indent>
    <verse>17</verse><span>Shall even he that hateth right govern?</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>And wilt thou condemn him that is most just?</span></indent>
    <verse>18</verse><span>Is it fit to say to a king, "Thou art wicked"?</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>And to princes, "Ye are ungodly"?</span></indent>
    <verse>19</verse><span>How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>nor regardeth the rich more than the poor?</span></indent>
    <indent><span>For they all are the work of his hands.</span></indent>
    <verse>20</verse><span>In a moment shall they die,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away;</span></indent>
    <indent><span>and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.</span></indent>
   </block>

   <block>
    <verse>21</verse><span>For his eyes are upon the ways of man,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and he seeth all his goings.</span></indent>
    <verse>22</verse><span>There is no darkness, nor shadow of death,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</span></indent>
    <verse>23</verse><span>For he will not lay upon man more than right;</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>that he should enter into judgment with God.</span></indent>
    <verse>24</verse><span>He shall break in pieces mighty men without number,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and set others in their stead.</span></indent>
    <verse>25</verse><span>Therefore he knoweth their works,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.</span></indent>
    <verse>26</verse><span>He striketh them as wicked men</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>in the open sight of others;</span></indent>
    <verse>27</verse><span>Because they turned back from him,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and would not consider any of his ways;</span></indent>
    <verse>28</verse><span>So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.</span></indent>
    <verse>29</verse><span>When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble?</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>And when he hideth his face, who then can behold him?</span></indent>
    <indent><span>Whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only;</span></indent>
    <verse>30</verse><span>That the hypocrite reign not,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>lest the people be ensnared.</span></indent>
   </block>

   <block>
    <verse>31</verse><span>Surely it is meet to be said unto God,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>"I have borne chastisement, I will not offend anymore.</span></indent>
    <verse>32</verse><span>That which I see not teach thou me;</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>if I have done iniquity, I will do no more."</span></indent>
    <verse>33</verse><span>Should it be according to thy mind?</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>He will recompense it, whether thou refuse,</span></indent><span>
    or whether thou choose; and not I;</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>therefore speak what thou knowest.</span></indent>
    <verse>34</verse><span>Let men of understanding tell me,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and let a wise man hearken unto me.</span></indent>
    <verse>35</verse><span>Job
    hath spoken without knowledge,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and his words were without wisdom.</span></indent>
    <verse>36</verse><span>My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>because of his answers for wicked men.</span></indent>
    <verse>37</verse><span>For he addeth rebellion unto his sin,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>he clappeth his hands among us,</span></indent>
    <indent><span>and multiplieth his words against God.</span></indent>

    <verse>2</verse><span>Thinkest thou this to be right,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>that thou saidst, "My righteousness is more than God's"?</span></indent>

    <indent><span>And, "What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin?"</span></indent>
    <verse>4</verse><span>I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.</span><break></break>
    <indent><verse>5</verse><span>Look unto the heavens, and see;</span></indent>
    <indent><span>and behold the clouds which are higher than thou.</span></indent>
    <verse>6</verse><span>If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him?</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>Or if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?</span></indent>
    <verse>7</verse><span>If thou be righteous, what givest thou him?</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>Or what receiveth he of thine hand?</span></indent>

    <verse>13</verse><span>Surely God will not hear vanity,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>neither will the Almighty regard it.</span></indent>
    <verse>14</verse><span>Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him,</span><break></break>

  <verse>10</verse><span>And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his
  friends; also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all
  they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with
  him in his house; and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the
  evil that the LORD had brought upon him; every man also gave him a piece
  of money, and everyone an earring of gold.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning; for
  he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand
  yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>He had also seven sons and three daughters.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And he called the name of the first Jemima; and the name of the second,
  Kezia; and the name of the third Keren-Happuch.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of
  Job; and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>After this lived Job a hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and
  his sons' sons, even four generations.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>So Job died, being old and full of days.

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God; he heard

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills
  moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth
  devoured; coals were kindled by it.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was under his
  feet.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly; yea, he
  did fly upon the wings of the wind.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>He made
  darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him were dark waters

  </span><verse>15</verse><span>Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world
  were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy
  nostrils.

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.

  wilt show thyself froward.
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high

  </span><verse>29</verse><span>For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped

  </span><verse>30</verse><span>O God, thy ways are perfect; the word of the LORD is tried; he is a
  buckler to all those who trust in him.

 <block>
  <verse>31</verse><span>For who is God save the LORD? Or who is a rock save our God,

  </span><verse>34</verse><span>He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine
  arms.
  </span><verse>35</verse><span>Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation; and thy right hand
  hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.
  </span><verse>36</verse><span>Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.
  </span><verse>37</verse><span>I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them; neither did I turn
  again till they were consumed.
  </span><verse>38</verse><span>I have wounded them that they were not able to rise; they are fallen
  under my feet.
  </span><verse>39</verse><span>For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle; thou hast
  subdued under me those that rose up against me.
  </span><verse>40</verse><span>Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy
  them that hate me.
  </span><verse>41</verse><span>They cried, but found none to save; unto the LORD, but he answered them
  not.
  </span><verse>42</verse><span>Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind; I did cast them
  out as the dirt in the streets.
 </span></block>

  <verse>43</verse><span>Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and thou hast

  <verse>11</verse><span>False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge things that I knew
  not.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>They
  rewarded me evil for good, for the purpose of the spoiling of my soul.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>But as for me,
 </span></block>

 <block><span>when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth; I humbled my soul with
 fasting; and my prayer returned into mine own bosom.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>I behaved myself as though he had been my
  friend or brother; I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth for his
  mother.

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together;
  yea, the abjects gathered themselves together against me, and I knew it

  <verse>17</verse><span>LORD, how long wilt thou look on? Rescue my soul from their

  <verse>19</verse><span>Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me; neither

  them that are quiet in the land.

  and my LORD.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; and let them
  not rejoice over me.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>Let them not say in their hearts, "Ah, so would we have it;" let them
  not say, "We have swallowed him up."

  <verse>27</verse><span>Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favor my righteous cause;
  yea, let them say continually, "Let the LORD be magnified, which hath
  pleasure in the prosperity of his servant."
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy praise all
  the day long.

  <verse>1</verse><span>The wicked, who live in transgression, saith in
  their hearts,
  </span><dunder><span>"There is no condemnation;"</span></dunder><span>
  for there is no fear of
  God before their eyes.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>For they flatter
  themselves in their own eyes, until their iniquities are found to be
  hateful.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>The words of their mouth are full of
  iniquity and deceit. The wicked man hath left off to be wise, and to do
  good;

  setteth himself in a way that is not good.

  <verse>6</verse><span>He is filled with thy righteousness like the
  great mountains, and with thy judgments like a great deep. O LORD, thou
  preservest man and beast.

  <verse>10</verse><span>Oh continue thy loving-kindness unto them that know thee; and thy

  <verse>1</verse><span>Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against

  <verse>3</verse><span>Trust in the LORD, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land, and

  <verse>7</verse><span>Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him; fret not thyself because

 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>Cease from anger, and forsake wrath; fret not thyself in any wise to do

  <verse>10</verse><span>For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be; yea, thou shalt

  <verse>14</verse><span>The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast

  broken.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many
  wicked.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>For the arms of the wicked shall be broken; but the LORD upholdeth the

  <verse>21</verse><span>The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again; but the righteous showeth

  cursed of him shall be cut off.

  <verse>23</verse><span>The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD; and he delighteth in

  <verse>27</verse><span>Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell forevermore.

  <verse>32</verse><span>The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.

  <verse>34</verse><span>Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit
  the land; when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it.

 <block>
  <verse>35</verse><span>I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither is

  disquietness of my heart.

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that openeth

  <verse>17</verse><span>For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before me.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong; and they that hate me
  wrongfully are multiplied.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I

  Our sins are not hid from God

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing; I am come into deep
  waters, where the floods overflow me.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>I am weary of my crying; my throat is dried; mine eyes fail while I
  wait for my God.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head;
  they that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty;
  then I restored that which I took not away.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from
  thee.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>Let not them that wait on thee, O LORD God of hosts, be ashamed for my
  sake; let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of
  Israel.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother's
  children.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of
  them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to my
  reproach.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>They that sit in the gate speak against me, and I was the song of the
  drunkards.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O LORD, in an acceptable time; O
  God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy
  salvation.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink; let me be delivered
  from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>Let not the waterflood overflow me,
  neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth
  upon me.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>Here me, O LORD; for thy loving-kindness is good; turn unto me
  according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble; hear me
  speedily.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it; deliver me because of mine
  enemies.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonor; mine
  adversaries are all before thee.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness; and I looked
  for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I
  found none.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me
  vinegar to drink.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>Let their table become a snare before them; and that which should have
  been for their welfare, let it become a trap.
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins
  continually to shake.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take
  hold of them.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their tents.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the
  grief of those whom thou hast wounded.
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>Add iniquity unto their iniquity; and let them not come into thy
  righteousness.
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written
  with the righteous.</span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>29</verse><span>But I am poor and sorrowful; let thy salvation, O God, set me up on
  high.
  </span><verse>30</verse><span>I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with
  thanksgiving.
  </span><verse>31</verse><span>This also shall please the LORD better than an ox or bullock that hath
  horns and hooves.
  </span><verse>32</verse><span>The humble shall see this, and be glad; and your heart shall live that
  seek God.
  </span><verse>33</verse><span>For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>34</verse><span>Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and everything that
  moveth therein.
  </span><verse>35</verse><span>For
  God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah; that they may
  dwell there, and have it in possession.

  </span><verse>3</verse><span>For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the
  wicked.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>For there are no bands in their death; but their strength is firm.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued like
  other men.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth
  them as a garment.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>Their eyes stand out with fatness; they have more than heart could
  wish.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression; they speak
  loftily.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh
  through the earth.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>Therefore his people return hither; and waters of a full cup are wrung

  </span><verse>12</verse><span>Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase

  consumed with terrors.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>As a dream when one awaketh; so, O LORD, when thou awakest, thou shalt
  despise their image.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>So foolish was I, and ignorant; I was as a beast before thee.

  <verse>23</verse><span>Nevertheless I am continually with thee; thou hast holden me by my

  </span><verse>6</verse><span>that the generation to come might know them, even the children which
  should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children;
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>that they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God,
  but keep his commandments;
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>and might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious
  generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose
  spirit was not steadfast with God.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in
  the day of battle.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>and forgat his works, and his wonders that he had showed them.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>Marvelous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of
  Egypt, in the field of Zoan.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>He divided the sea, and
  caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as a heap.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>In the daytime also he led them with a cloud,
  and all the night with a light of fire.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>He
  clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great
  depths.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>He brought streams also out of the
  rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the Most High in the
  wilderness.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>Yea, they spake against God; they said, "Can God furnish a table in the
  wilderness?
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams
  overflowed; can he give bread also? Can he provide flesh for his
  people?"
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth; so a fire was kindled
  against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation;
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of
  heaven,
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>and had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the
  corn of heaven.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>Man did eat angels' food; he sent them meat to the full.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven; and by his power he
  brought in the south wind.
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the
  sand of the sea;
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>and he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their
  habitations.
  </span><verse>29</verse><span>So they did eat, and were well filled; for he gave them their own
  desire;
  </span><verse>30</verse><span>they were not estranged from their lust; but while their meat was yet
  in their mouths,
  </span><verse>31</verse><span>the wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and
  smote down the chosen men of Israel.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>32</verse><span>For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous
  works.
  </span><verse>33</verse><span>Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in
  trouble.
  </span><verse>34</verse><span>When he slew them, then they sought him; and they returned and inquired
  early after God.
  </span><verse>35</verse><span>And they remembered that God was their Rock, and the high God their
  Redeemer.
  </span><verse>36</verse><span>Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto
  him with their tongues.
  </span><verse>37</verse><span>For their heart was not right with him, neither were they steadfast in
  his covenant.
  </span><verse>38</verse><span>But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed
  them not; yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up
  all his wrath.
  </span><verse>39</verse><span>For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away,
  and cometh not again.
  </span><verse>40</verse><span>How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the
  desert!
  </span><verse>41</verse><span>Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of
  Israel.
  </span><verse>42</verse><span>They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from
  the enemy;
  </span><verse>43</verse><span>how he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of
  Zoan;
  </span><verse>44</verse><span>and had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they
  could not drink.
  </span><verse>45</verse><span>He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and
  frogs, which destroyed them.
  </span><verse>46</verse><span>He gave also their increase unto the caterpillar, and their labor unto
  the locust.
  </span><verse>47</verse><span>He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycamore trees with
  frost.
  </span><verse>48</verse><span>He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot
  thunderbolts.
  </span><verse>49</verse><span>He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation,
  and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.
  </span><verse>50</verse><span>He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but
  gave their life over to the pestilence;
  </span><verse>51</verse><span>and smote all the first- born in Egypt; the chief of their strength in
  the tabernacles of Ham;
  </span><verse>52</verse><span>but made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the
  wilderness like a flock.
  </span><verse>53</verse><span>And he led them on safely, so that they feared not; but the sea
  overwhelmed their enemies.
  </span><verse>54</verse><span>And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this
  mountain, which his right hand had purchased.
  </span><verse>55</verse><span>He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an
  inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their
  tents.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>56</verse><span>Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his
  testimonies;
  </span><verse>57</verse><span>but
  turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers; they were turned
  aside like a deceitful bow.
  </span><verse>58</verse><span>For they provoked
  him to anger with their high places, and moved him to
 </span></block>

 <block><span>jealousy with their graven images.
  </span><verse>59</verse><span>When God heard this, he was wroth, and
  greatly abhorred Israel.
  </span><verse>60</verse><span>So that he forsook
  the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;
  </span><verse>61</verse><span>and delivered his strength into captivity, and
  his glory into the enemy's hand.
  </span><verse>62</verse><span>He gave his
  people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance,
  </span><verse>63</verse><span>the fire consumed their young men; and their
  maidens were not given to marriage.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>64</verse><span>Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.
  </span><verse>65</verse><span>Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that
  shouteth by reason of wine.
  </span><verse>66</verse><span>And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts; he put them to a
  perpetual reproach.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>67</verse><span>Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe
  of Ephraim;
  </span><verse>68</verse><span>but
  chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.
  </span><verse>69</verse><span>And he built his sanctuary like high palaces,
  like the earth which he hath established forever.
  </span><verse>70</verse><span>He chose David also his servant, and took him
  from the sheepfolds;
  </span><verse>71</verse><span>from following the ewes
  great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his
  inheritance.
  </span><verse>72</verse><span>So he fed them according to the
  integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.

  </span><verse>2</verse><span>let my prayer come before thee; incline thine ear unto my cry;
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>for my soul is full of troubles; and my life draweth nigh unto the
  grave.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>I am counted with them that go down into the pit; I am as a man that
  hath no strength;
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom thou
  rememberest no more; and they are cut off from thy hand.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted me with all thy
  waves. Selah.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast made me an
  abomination unto them; I am shut up, and I cannot come forth.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction; LORD, I have called daily
  upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>Wilt thou show wonders to the dead? Shall the dead arise and praise
  thee? Selah.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>Shall thy loving-kindness be declared in the grave? Or thy faithfulness
  in destruction?
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? And thy righteousness in the
  land of forgetfulness?

  <verse>13</verse><span>But unto thee have I cried, O LORD; and in the morning shall my prayer
  prevent thee.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>LORD, why castest thou off my soul? Why hidest thou thy face from me?
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up; while I suffer thy
  terrors I am distracted.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me about

  </span><verse>18</verse><span>Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, and mine acquaintance into

  <verse>1</verse><span>I will sing of the mercies of the LORD forever, with my mouth will I

  establish in the very heavens."
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>I have made a

  </span><verse>7</verse><span>God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be

  </span><verse>8</verse><span>O LORD God of hosts, who is a strong LORD like unto thee? Or to thy

  </span><verse>9</verse><span>Thou rulest the raging of the sea; when the waves thereof arise, thou
  stillest them.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou hast
  scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine; as for the world and
  the fullness thereof, thou hast founded them.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>The north and the south thou hast created them; Tabor and Hermon shall
  rejoice in thy name.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>Thou hast a mighty arm; strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne; mercy and truth
  shall go before thy face.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound; they shall walk, O
  LORD, in the light of thy countenance.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>In thy name shall they rejoice all the day; and in thy righteousness
  shall they be exalted.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>For thou art the glory of their strength; and in thy favor our horn

  </span><verse>18</verse><span>For the LORD is our defense; and the Holy One of Israel is our
  King.
 </span></block>

  <verse>19</verse><span>Then thou spakest in vision to thy Holy One, and saidst, "I have laid
  help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the
  people.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him;
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>with whom my hand shall be established; mine arm also shall strengthen
  him.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness afflict
  him.
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them that
  hate him.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him; and in my name

  </span><verse>25</verse><span>I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the

  <verse>26</verse><span>He shall cry unto me, "Thou art my Father, my God, and the Rock of my

  </span><verse>27</verse><span>Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth.
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>My mercy will I keep for him forevermore, and my covenant shall stand
  fast with him.
  </span><verse>29</verse><span>His seed also will I make to endure forever, and his throne as the days
  of heaven.
  </span><verse>30</verse><span>If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;
  </span><verse>31</verse><span>if they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;
  </span><verse>32</verse><span>then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity
  with stripes.
  </span><verse>33</verse><span>Nevertheless my loving-kindness will I not
  utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.
  </span><verse>34</verse><span>My covenant will I not break, nor alter the
  thing that is gone out of my lips.
  </span><verse>35</verse><span>Once have I
  sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David.
  </span><verse>36</verse><span>His seed shall endure forever, and his throne
  as the sun before me.
  </span><verse>37</verse><span>It shall be established
  forever as the moon, and as a faithful witness in heaven. Selah.

  <verse>38</verse><span>But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with thine

  by casting it to the ground.
  </span><verse>40</verse><span>Thou hast broken
  down all his hedges; thou hast brought his strongholds to ruin.
  </span><verse>41</verse><span>All that pass by the way spoil him; he is a
  reproach to his neighbors.
  </span><verse>42</verse><span>Thou hast set up
  the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast made all his enemies to
  rejoice.
  </span><verse>43</verse><span>Thou hast also turned the edge of his
  sword, and hast not made him to stand in the battle.
  </span><verse>44</verse><span>Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast
  his throne down to the ground.
  </span><verse>45</verse><span>The days of his
  youth hast thou shortened; thou hast covered him with shame. Selah.

  <verse>13</verse><span>They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel;

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>They made a calf in Horeb, and worshiped the molten image.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth

  </span><verse>21</verse><span>They forgat God their savior, which had done great things in Egypt;
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red Sea.
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word;

 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>28</verse><span>They joined themselves also unto Baal-Peor, and ate the sacrifices of

 <block>
  <verse>34</verse><span>They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded
  them;

  <verse>40</verse><span>Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people,

  that hated them ruled over them.
  </span><verse>42</verse><span>Their enemies
  also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their

  </span><verse>43</verse><span>Many times did he deliver them; but they

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Oh give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good; for his mercy endureth
  forever.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from the
  hand of the enemy;
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>and gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west,
  from the north, and from the south.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city
  to dwell in.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them
  out of their distresses.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of
  habitation.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his
  wonderful works to the children of men!
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with
  goodness.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in
  affliction and iron;
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>because they rebelled against the works of God, and contemned the
  counsel of the Most High;
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>therefore he brought down their heart with labor; they fell down, and
  there was none to help.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them out
  of their distresses.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake
  their bands in sunder.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his
  wonderful works to the children of men!
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in
  sunder.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>Fools, because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities,
  are afflicted.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the
  gates of death.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth them out of
  their distresses.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their
  destructions.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his
  wonderful works to the children of men!
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his
  works with rejoicing.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great
  waters;
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>these see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the
  waves thereof.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths; their
  soul is melted because of trouble.
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their
  wit's end.
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out
  of their distresses.
  </span><verse>29</verse><span>He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.
  </span><verse>30</verse><span>Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto
  their desired haven.
  </span><verse>31</verse><span>On that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his
  wonderful works to the children of men!
  </span><verse>32</verse><span>Let them
  exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the
  assembly of the elders.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>33</verse><span>He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry
  ground;
  </span><verse>34</verse><span>a fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell
  therein.
  </span><verse>35</verse><span>He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into
  water springs.
  </span><verse>36</verse><span>And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city
  for habitation;
  </span><verse>37</verse><span>and sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of
  increase.
  </span><verse>38</verse><span>He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and
  suffereth not their cattle to decrease.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>39</verse><span>Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression,
  affliction, and sorrow.
  </span><verse>40</verse><span>He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the
  wilderness, where there is no way.
  </span><verse>41</verse><span>Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh him
  families like a flock.
  </span><verse>42</verse><span>The righteous shall see it, and rejoice; and all iniquity shall stop
  her mouth.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>43</verse><span>Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall
  understand the loving- kindness of the LORD.

  <verse>1</verse><span>O God, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with my
  glory.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>Awake,
  psaltery and harp; I myself will awake early.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>I
  will praise thee, O LORD, among the people; and I will sing praises unto
  thee among the nations.

  <verse>5</verse><span>Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; and thy glory above all the
  earth;
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>that thy beloved may be delivered; save with thy right hand, and answer
  me.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>God hath spoken in his holiness, "I will rejoice, I will divide
  Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine
  head; Judah is my lawgiver;
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over Philistia
  will I triumph."
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>Who will bring me into the strong city? Who will lead me into Edom?
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? And wilt not thou, O God,
  go forth with our hosts?
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>Give us help from trouble; for vain is the help of man.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>Through God we shall do valiantly; for he it is that shall tread down
  our enemies.

  Deliver thou me

 <chapter>109
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>for the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened
  against me; they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>They compassed me about;
  </span><dunder><span>they spake against me</span></dunder><span>
  also, with words of hatred; and fought
  against me without a cause.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And,
  notwithstanding my love, they are my adversaries; yet I will continue in
  prayer for them.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And they have rewarded me evil
  for good, and hatred for my love.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>Set thou a wicked man over them; and let Satan stand at his right hand.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>When they shall be judged, let them be condemned; and let their prayer
  become sin.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>Let their days be few; let another take their office.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>Let their children be fatherless; and their wives widows.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>Let their children be continually vagabonds, and beg; let them seek
  also out of their desolate places.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>Let the extortioner catch all that they have; and let the stranger
  spoil their labor.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>Let there be none to extend mercy unto them; neither let there be any
  to favor their fatherless children.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>Let their posterity be cut off in the generation following; let their
  names be blotted out.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>Let the iniquity of their fathers be remembered before the LORD;
  and let not the sin of their mothers be blotted out.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>Let them be before the LORD continually, that
  he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>Because they remembered not to show mercy, but persecuted the poor and
  needy man, that they might even slay the broken in heart.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>As they loved cursing, so let it come upon them; as they delighted not
  in blessing, so let it be far from them.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>As they clothed themselves with cursing like as with their garments, so
  let it come into their bowels like water, and like oil into their bones.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>Let it be unto them as a garment which covereth them, and for a girdle
  wherewith they are girded continually.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>This shall be the reward of mine adversaries, from the LORD; and of
  them who speak evil against my soul.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>But do thou deliver me, O LORD my God, for thy name's sake; because thy
  mercy is good, therefore deliver thou me.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>I am gone like the shadow when it declineth; I am tossed up and down as
  the locust.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>I became also a reproach unto them; when they looked upon me they
  shaked their heads.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>26</verse><span>Help me, O LORD my God; oh save me according to thy mercy;
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>that they may know that this is thy hand; that thou, LORD, hast done
  it.
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>Let them curse, but bless thou; when they arise, let them be ashamed;
  but let thy servant rejoice.
  </span><verse>29</verse><span>Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame; and let them cover
  themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>30</verse><span>I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will praise him
  among the multitude.
  </span><verse>31</verse><span>For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him from
  those that condemn his soul.

  holiness from the womb of the morning; thou hast the dew of thy youth.

  know me; refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul.

  <verse>5</verse><span>I cried unto thee, O LORD; I said, "Thou art my refuge and my portion

  <verse>27</verse><span>Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power

  </span><verse>28</verse><span>Say not unto thy neighbor, "Go, and come again, and tomorrow I will
  give;" when thou hast it by thee.

  </span><verse>30</verse><span>Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no
  harm.
  </span><verse>31</verse><span>Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.
  </span><verse>32</verse><span>For the froward is abomination to the LORD; but his secret is with the

  </span><verse>33</verse><span>The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked; but he blesseth

  </span><verse>34</verse><span>Surely he scorneth the scorners; but he giveth grace unto the lowly.

  The instruction of a father

 <chapter>4

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know
  understanding.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>For I was my father's son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my
  mother.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>He taught me also, and said unto me, "Let thine heart retain my words;
  keep my commandments, and live.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>Get wisdom, get understanding; forget it not; neither decline from the
  words of my mouth.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee; love her, and she shall
  keep thee.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom; and with all thy
  getting get understanding.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>Exalt her, and she shall promote thee; she shall bring thee to honor,
  when thou dost embrace her.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace; a crown of glory
  shall she deliver to thee."
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall
  be many.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right
  paths.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou
  runnest, thou shalt not stumble.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go; keep her; for she is thy
  life.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil
  men.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is
  taken away, unless they cause some to fall.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and
  more unto the perfect day.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>The way of the wicked is as darkness; they know not at what they
  stumble.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine
  heart.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their
  flesh.
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of
  life.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from
  thee.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight
  before thee.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>Turn not to the right hand nor to the left; remove thy foot from
  evil.

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>My son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my understanding;
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>that thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips may keep
  knowledge.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>For the lips of a strange woman drop as a honeycomb, and her mouth is
  smoother than oil;
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>but her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are movable, that
  thou canst not know them.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of

  </span><verse>8</verse><span>Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house;
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>lest thou give thine honor unto others, and thy years unto the cruel;
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labors be in the
  house of a stranger;
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>and thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>and say, "How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>and have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to
  them that instructed me!
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and

  </span><verse>17</verse><span>Let them be only thine own, and not strangers'

  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a
  strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>For the ways of man are before the eyes of the
  LORD, and he pondereth all his goings.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>His own
  iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the
  cords of his sins.

  words of thy mouth.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the
  hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.

  </span><verse>9</verse><span>How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? When wilt thou arise out of thy

  </span><verse>10</verse><span>Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to

  </span><verse>11</verse><span>so shall thy poverty come as one that traveleth, and thy want as an

  </span><verse>14</verse><span>frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he

  Warning against adultery

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy
  mother;
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>bind
  them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy neck.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou
  sleepest, it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with
  thee.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of
  instruction are the way of life;
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>to keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of
  a strange women.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>Lust
  not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her
  eyelids.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>For by means of a whorish woman a man
  is brought to a piece of bread; and the adulteress will hunt for the
  precious life.

  <verse>27</verse><span>Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?

  shall not be innocent.

 <block>
  <verse>30</verse><span>Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is
  hungry;
  </span><verse>31</verse><span>but if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the
  substance of his house.
  </span><verse>32</verse><span>But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding; he
  that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.
  </span><verse>33</verse><span>A wound and dishonor shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped
  away.
  </span><verse>34</verse><span>For jealousy is the rage of a man; therefore he will not spare in the
  day of vengeance.

  thou givest many gifts.

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>Say unto wisdom, "Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy

  </span><verse>5</verse><span>that they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger which
  flattereth with her words."
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>and beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths a young
  man void of understanding,
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her
  house.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night;
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>and, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of a harlot, and
  subtile of heart.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>(She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house;
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every
  corner.)
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto
  him,
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>"I have peace offerings with me; this day have I paid my vows.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I
  have found thee.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works,
  with fine linen of Egypt.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning; let us solace
  ourselves with loves.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey;
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>he hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at the day
  appointed."
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering
  of her lips she forced him.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as
  a fool to the correction of the stocks;
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare,
  and knoweth not that it is for his life.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words
  of my mouth.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>For she hath cast down many wounded; yea, many strong men have been
  slain by her.

  death.

  </span><verse>24</verse><span>When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no
  fountains abounding with water.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought
  forth;
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>while as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest
  part of the dust of the world.
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>When he prepared the heavens, I was there; when he set a compass upon
  the face of the depth;
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>when he established the clouds above; when he strengthened the
  fountains of the deep;
  </span><verse>29</verse><span>when he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his
  commandment; when he appointed the foundations of the earth;
  </span><verse>30</verse><span>then I was by him, as one brought up with him; and I was daily his
  delight, rejoicing always before him;

 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness; for the throne
  is established by righteousness.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>Righteous lips are the delight of kings; and they love him that
  speaketh right.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>The wrath of a king is as messengers of death; but a wise man will
  pacify it.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>In the light of the king's countenance is life; and his favor is as
  a cloud of the latter rain.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! And to get
  understanding rather to be chosen than silver!
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>The highway of the upright is to depart from evil; he that keeps
  his way preserveth his soul.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>Pride goeth before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a
  fall.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>Better it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to
  divide the spoil with the proud.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good; and whoso
  trusteth in the LORD, happy is he.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>The wise in heart shall be called prudent; and the sweetness of the
  lips increaseth learning.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>Understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it; but
  the instruction of fools is folly.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning to
  his lips.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>Pleasant words are as a honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to
  the bones.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>25</verse><span>There is a way that seemeth right unto a man; but the end thereof
  are the ways of death.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>26</verse><span>He that laboreth, laboreth for himself; for his mouth craveth it of
  him.
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>An ungodly man diggeth up evil; and in his lips there is as a
  burning fire.
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>A froward man soweth strife; and a whisperer separateth chief
  friends.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>29</verse><span>A violent man enticeth his neighbor, and leadeth him into a way
  that is not good.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>30</verse><span>He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things; moving his lips he
  bringeth evil to pass.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>31</verse><span>The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way of
  righteousness.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>32</verse><span>He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that
  ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>33</verse><span>The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of
  the LORD.
 </span></block>

 <chapter>17</chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than a house full
  of sacrifices with strife.</span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, and
  shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>The fining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold; but the LORD
  trieth the hearts.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips; and a liar giveth ear to a
  naughty tongue.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker; and he that is glad at
  calamities shall not be unpunished.
 </span></block>

  <verse>6</verse><span>Children's children are the crown of old men; and the glory of children

  <verse>7</verse><span>Excellent speech becometh not a fool; much less do lying lips a
  prince.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it;
  whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that repeateth a
  matter separateth very friends.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>A reproof entereth more into a wise man than a hundred stripes into a
  fool.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>An evil man seeketh only rebellion; therefore a cruel messenger shall
  be sent against him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool in his
  folly.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his
  house.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water; therefore
  leave off contention, before it be meddled with.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even
  they both are abomination to the LORD.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing
  he hath no heart to it?
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for
  adversity.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>A man void of understanding striketh hands, and becometh surety in the
  presence of his friend.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>He loveth transgression that loveth strife; and he that exalteth his
  gate seeketh destruction.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>He that hath a froward heart findeth no good; and he that hath a
  perverse tongue falleth into mischief.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow; and the father of a
  fool hath no joy.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>A merry heart doeth good like a medicine; but a broken spirit drieth
  the bones.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>A wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of
  judgment.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>Wisdom is before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of a fool
  are in the ends of the earth.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>25</verse><span>A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bare
  him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>26</verse><span>Also to punish the just is not good, nor to strike princes for
  equity.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>27</verse><span>He that hath knowledge spareth his words; and a man of understanding is
  of an excellent spirit.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>28</verse><span>Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise; and he that
  shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding.
 </span></block>

 <chapter>18
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Through desire, a man, having separated himself, seeketh and
  intermeddleth with all wisdom.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may
  discover itself.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>When the wicked cometh, then cometh also contempt, and with ignominy
  reproach.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>The words of a man's mouth are as deep waters, and the wellspring of
  wisdom as a flowing brook.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>It is not good to accept the person of the wicked, to overthrow the
  righteous in judgment.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>A fool's lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for
  strokes.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>A fool's mouth is his destruction, and his lips are the snare of his
  soul.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the
  innermost parts of the belly.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great
  waster.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>The name of the LORD is a strong tower; the righteous runneth into it,
  and is safe.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>The rich man's wealth is his strong city, and as a high wall in his own
  conceit.</span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>Before destruction the heart of man is haughty; and before honor is
  humility.</span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>He that answereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly and shame
  unto him.</span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit
  who can bear?</span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise
  seeketh knowledge.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>A man's gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great
  men.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>He that is first in his own cause seemeth just; but his neighbor cometh
  and searcheth him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the
  mighty.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city; and their
  contentions are like the bars of a castle.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>A man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; and with
  the increase of his lips shall he be filled.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>Death and life are in the power of the tongue; and they that love it
  shall eat the fruit thereof.
 </span></block>

  <verse>22</verse><span>Whoso findeth
  </span><under>
   <note><span>a wife findeth a good thing and</span></note><span>a good wife</span></under><span>
  hath obtained favor of the LORD.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>The poor useth entreaties; but the rich answereth roughly.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>A man that hath friends must show himself friendly; and there is a
  friend that sticketh closer than a brother.
 </span></block>

 <chapter>19
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity, than he that is
  perverse in his lips, and is a fool.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>Also, that the soul be without knowledge, it is not good; and he that
  hasteth with his feet sinneth.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>The foolishness of man perverteth his way; and his heart fretteth
  against the LORD.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his
  neighbor.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>A false witness shall not be unpunished; and he that speaketh lies
  shall not escape.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>Many will entreat the favor of the prince; and every man is a friend to
  him that giveth gifts.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>All the brethren of the poor do hate him; how much more do his friends
  go far from him? He pursueth them with words, yet they are wanting to
  him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul; he that keeps understanding
  shall find good.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>A false witness shall not be unpunished; and he that speaketh lies
  shall perish.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to have rule
  over princes.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and it is his glory to
  pass over a transgression.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>The king's wrath is as the roaring of a lion; but his favor is as dew
  upon the grass.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>A foolish son is the calamity of his father; and the contentions of a
  wife are a continual dropping.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>House and riches are the inheritance of fathers; and a prudent wife is
  from the LORD.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer
  hunger.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>He that keeps the commandment keeps his own soul; but he that despiseth
  his ways shall die.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and that which
  he hath given will he pay him again.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his
  crying.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment; for if thou deliver him,
  yet thou must do it again.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise in thy
  latter end.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>There are many devices in a man's heart; nevertheless the counsel of
  the LORD, that shall stand.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>The desire of a man is his kindness; and a poor man is better than a
  liar.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>The fear of the LORD tendeth to life; and he that hath it shall abide
  satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>A slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom, and will not so much as
  bring it to his mouth again.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>25</verse><span>Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware; and reprove one that hath
  understanding, and he will understand knowledge.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>26</verse><span>He that wasteth his father, and chaseth away his mother, is a son that
  causeth shame, and bringeth reproach.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>27</verse><span>Cease, my son, to hear the instruction that causeth to err from the
  words of knowledge.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>28</verse><span>An ungodly witness scorneth judgment; and the mouth of the wicked
  devoureth iniquity.

  fools.
 </span></block>

 <chapter>20

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging; and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>The fear of a king is as the roaring of a lion; whoso provoketh him to
  anger sinneth against his own soul.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>It is an honor for a man to cease from strife; but every fool will be
  meddling.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>The sluggard will not plough by reason of the cold; therefore shall he
  beg in harvest, and have nothing.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water, but a man of
  understanding will draw it out.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>Most men will proclaim everyone his own goodness; but a faithful man
  who can find?
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>The just man walketh in his integrity; his children are blessed after
  him.
 </span></block>

  <verse>8</verse><span>A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all evil
  with his eyes.
 </span></block>

  <verse>9</verse><span>Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin?
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>Divers weights, and divers measures, both of them are alike abomination
  to the LORD.</span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work be pure, and
  whether it be right.</span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the LORD hath made even both of
  them.</span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes, and thou
  shalt be satisfied with bread.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>"It is naught, it is naught," saith the buyer; but when he is gone his
  way, then he boasteth.

  a precious jewel.
 </span></block>

  him for a strange women.
 </span></block>

  <verse>17</verse><span>Bread of deceit is sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth shall be
  filed with gravel.
 </span></block>

  shall save thee.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>Divers weights are an abomination unto the LORD; and a false balance is
  not good.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>Men's goings are of the LORD; how can a man then understand his own
  way?
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>25</verse><span>It is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy, and after
  vows to make inquiry.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>26</verse><span>A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over
  them.

  sacrifice.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>A high look, and a proud heart, and the ploughing of the wicked, is
  sin.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness; but of
  everyone that is hasty only to want.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and
  fro of them that seek death.
 </span></block>

  <verse>7</verse><span>The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; because they refuse to do
  judgment.
 </span></block>

  wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge.

  The words of the wise
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>Bow down thine ear, and hear the words of the wise, and apply thine
  heart unto my knowledge.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>For it is a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee; they shall
  withal be fitted in thy lips.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>That thy trust may be in the LORD, I have made known to thee this day,
  even to thee.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>Have not I written to thee excellent things in counsels and
  knowledge,
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>that I might make thee know the certainty of the words of truth; that
  thou mightest answer the words of truth to them that send unto
  thee?
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>Rob not the poor, because he is poor; neither oppress the afflicted in
  the gate;
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>for the LORD will plead their cause, and spoil the soul of those that
  spoiled them.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>Make no friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man thou shalt
  not go;
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>lest
  thou learn his ways, and get a snare to thy soul.

 <chapter>23
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what is
  before thee;
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>and put a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man given to appetite.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>Be not desirous of his dainties; for they are deceitful meat.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Labor not to be rich; cease from thine own wisdom.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? For riches certainly
  make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye, neither desire
  thou his dainty meats;
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>for as he thinketh in his heart, so is he; "Eat and drink," saith he to
  thee; but his heart is not with thee.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, and lose thy
  sweet words.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>Speak not in the ears of a fool; for he will despise the wisdom of thy
  words.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of the

  </span><verse>11</verse><span>for their Redeemer is mighty; he shall plead their cause with
  thee.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>Apply thine heart unto instruction, and thine ears to the words of
  knowledge.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>Withhold not correction from the child; for if thou beatest him with

  </span><verse>14</verse><span>Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from
  hell.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>Yea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right things.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>Let not thine heart envy sinners; but be thou in the fear of the LORD

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the way.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>Be not among wine bibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh;

  shall clothe a man with rags.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy mother
  when she is old.

  <verse>23</verse><span>Buy the truth, and sell it not; also wisdom, and instruction, and
  understanding.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>The
  father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice; and he that begetteth a
  wise child shall have joy of him.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>Thy father
  and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare thee shall rejoice.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>26</verse><span>My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways.
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>For a whore is a deep ditch; and a strange woman is a narrow pit.
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>She also lieth in wait as for a prey, and increaseth the transgressors
  among men.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>29</verse><span>Who hath woe? Who hath sorrow? Who hath contentions? Who hath babbling?
  Who hath wounds without cause? Who hath redness of eyes?
  </span><verse>30</verse><span>They that tarry long at the wine;
  they that go to seek mixed wine.
  </span><verse>31</verse><span>Look not thou upon the wine when it is red,
  when it giveth his color in the cup, when it moveth itself aright.
  </span><verse>32</verse><span>At the last it biteth like a serpent, and
  stingeth like an adder.
  </span><verse>33</verse><span>thine eyes shall
  behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter perverse things.
  </span><verse>34</verse><span>Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in
  the midst of the sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast.
  </span><verse>35</verse><span>"They have stricken me," shalt thou say," and
  I was not sick; they have beaten me, and I felt it not; when shall I
  awake? I will seek it yet again."

 <chapter>24
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Be not thou envious against evil men, neither desire to be with them;
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>for their heart studieth destruction, and their lips talk of
  mischief.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>Through wisdom is a house builded; and buy understanding it is
  established;
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>and by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and
  pleasant riches.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>A wise man is strong; yea, a man of knowledge increaseth strength.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war; and in multitude of
  counselors there is safety.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>Wisdom is too high for a fool; he openeth not his mouth in the
  gate.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous person.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>The thought of foolishness is sin; and the scorner is an abomination to
  men.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>If thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death, and those
  that are ready to be slain;
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>if thou sayest, "Behold, we knew it not; doth not he that pondereth the
  heart consider it? And he that keeps thy soul, doth not he know it? And
  shall not he render to every man according to his works?"
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>My son, eat thou honey, because it is good; and the honeycomb, which is
  sweet to thy taste;
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>so shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul; when thou hast found
  it, then there shall be a reward, and thy expectation shall not be cut
  off.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>Lay not wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the righteous;
  spoil not his resting- place;
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>for a just man falleth seven times, and riseth up again; but the wicked
  shall fall into mischief.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad
  when he stumbleth;
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>lest the LORD see it, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath
  from him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>Fret not thyself because of evil men, neither be thou envious at the
  wicked;
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>for there shall be no reward to the evil man; the candle of the wicked
  shall be put out.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>My son, fear thou the LORD and the king; and meddle not with them that
  are given to change.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of
  them both?
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>These things also belong to the wise. It is not good to have respect of
  persons in judgment.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>He that saith unto the wicked, "Thou art righteous; him shall the
  people curse, nations shall abhor him."
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>But to them that rebuke him shall be delight, and a good blessing shall
  come upon them.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>Every man shall kiss his lips that giveth a right answer.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>27</verse><span>Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the field; and
  afterwards build thine house.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>28</verse><span>Be not a witness against thy neighbor without cause; and deceive not
  with thy lips.
  </span><verse>29</verse><span>Say
  not, "I will do so to him as he hath done to me; I will render to the man
  according to his work."
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>30</verse><span>I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man
  void of understanding;
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>31</verse><span>and, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered the
  face thereof, and
 </span></block>

 <block><span>the stone wall thereof was broken down.
  </span><verse>32</verse><span>Then I saw, and considered it well; I looked
  upon it, and received instruction.
  </span><verse>33</verse><span>Yet a
  little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep;
  </span><verse>34</verse><span>so shall thy poverty come as one that
  traveleth; and thy want as an armed man.

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver.

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty,

  reward thee.

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>The north wind driveth away rain; so doth an angry countenance a

  The man spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal,
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>"Surely I am more brutish than any man, and
  have not the understanding of a man.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>I
  neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>Who hath ascended up into heaven, or
  descended? Who hath gathered the wind in his fists? Who hath bound the

  What is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou canst tell?"
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>Every word of God is pure; he is a shield unto them that put their

  </span><verse>6</verse><span>Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be

 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>Two things have I required of thee; deny me them not before I die;

  riches; feed me with food convenient for me;
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, "Who is the LORD?" Or lest
  I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain.

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, and thou

 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>There is a generation that curseth their father, and doth not bless
  their mother.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet is

  </span><verse>13</verse><span>There is a generation, oh how lofty are their eyes! And their

  </span><verse>14</verse><span>There

 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>The horseleech hath two daughters, crying, "Give, give." There are
  three things that are never satisfied, yea, four things say not, "It

  <verse>17</verse><span>The eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his

  <verse>18</verse><span>There be three things which are too wonderful for me, yea, four

  </span><verse>19</verse><span>the

  of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid.

  <verse>21</verse><span>For three things the earth is disquieted, and for four which it
  cannot bear;
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>for a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled with
  meat;
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>for an odious woman when she is married; and a handmaid that is
  heir to her mistress.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>There be four things which are little upon the earth, but they are
  exceeding wise:
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>the
  ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the
  summer;
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>the conies are but a feeble folk,
  yet make they their houses in the rocks;
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>the locusts have no king, yet go they
  forth all of them by bands;
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>the spider
  taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings' palaces.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>29</verse><span>There be three things which go well, yea, four are comely in going:
  </span><verse>30</verse><span>a lion, which is strongest among beasts, and turneth not away from
  any;
  </span><verse>31</verse><span>a greyhound; a he goat also; and a king, against whom there is no
  rising up.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>32</verse><span>If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast
  thought evil, lay thine hand upon thy mouth.
  </span><verse>33</verse><span>Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the wringing
  of the nose bringest forth blood; so the forcing of wrath bringeth
  forth strife.

  </span><verse>3</verse><span>Give

  pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>Give strong drink unto him that is ready to
  perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and

  </span><verse>8</verse><span>Open thy mouth for

  All is vanity

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is
  vanity.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>What profit hath a man of all his labor which he taketh under the sun?
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh; but the
  earth abideth forever.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place
  where he arose.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it
  whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to
  his circuits.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea in not full; unto the
  place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>All things are full of labor; man cannot utter it; the eye is not
  satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is
  done is that which shall be done; and there is no new thing under the
  sun.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>Is there anything whereof it may be said, "See, this is new"? It hath
  been already of old time, which was before us.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any
  remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come
  after.

 <heading><span>
  The vanity of wisdom
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all
  things that are done under heaven; this sore travail hath God given to
  the sons of man to be exercised therewith.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all
  is vanity and vexation of spirit.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>That which is crooked cannot be made straight; and that which is
  wanting cannot be numbered.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>I communed with mine own heart, saying, "Lo, I am come to great estate,
  and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in
  Jerusalem; yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge."
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly; I
  perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>For in much wisdom is much grief; and he that increaseth knowledge
  increaseth sorrow.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  The vanity of self-indulgence
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>2
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>I said in mine heart, "Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth;
  therefore enjoy pleasure;" and, behold, this also is vanity.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>I said of laughter, "It is mad;" and of mirth, "What doeth it?"
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine
  heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was
  that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all
  the days of their life.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards;
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kind
  of fruits;
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth
  forth trees;
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also
  I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in
  Jerusalem before me;
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings
  and of the provinces; I gat me men singers and women singers, and the
  delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments, and that of all
  sorts.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in
  Jerusalem; also my wisdom remained with me.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not
  my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labor; and this
  was my portion of all my labor.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought,
  and on the labor that I had labored to do; and, behold, all was vanity and
  vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  The vanity of trying to live wisely
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly; for what
  can the man do that cometh after the king? Even that which hath been
  already done.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth
  darkness.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>The wise man's eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness;
  and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>Then said I in my heart, "As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth
  even to me;" and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart that
  this also is vanity.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool forever;
  seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And
  how dieth the wise man? As the fool.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun
  is grievous unto me; for all is vanity and vexation of spirit.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  The vanity of labor
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>Yea, I hated all my labor which I had taken under the sun, because I
  should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? Yet shall he
  have rule over all my labor wherein I have labored, and wherein I have
  showed myself wise under the sun. This is also vanity.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labor
  which I took under the sun.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>For there is a man whose labor is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in
  equity; yet to a man that hath not labored therein shall he leave it for
  his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>For what hath man of all his labor, and of the vexation of his heart,
  wherein he hath labored under the sun?
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart
  taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink,
  and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labor. This also I
  saw, that it was from the hand of God.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I?
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight, wisdom, and
  knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and
  to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God. This also
  is vanity and vexation of spirit.

  </span><verse>11</verse><span>He hath made everything beautiful in his time; also he hath set the

  <verse>16</verse><span>And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that wickedness

  </span><verse>17</verse><span>I said in mine heart, "God shall judge the righteous and the wicked;"

  </span><verse>18</verse><span>I said in mine heart concerning the estates of the sons of men, that
  God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves

  </span><verse>19</verse><span>For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under
  the sun; and behold the tears of such as where oppressed, and they had
  no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but
  they had no comforter.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead, more than the
  living, which are yet alive.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>Yea, better is he than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not
  seen the evil work that is done under the sun.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a
  man is envied of his neighbor. This is also vanity and vexation of
  spirit.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>Better is a handful with quietness, than both the hands full with
  travail and vexation of spirit.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath neither
  child nor brother; yet is there no end of all his labor; neither is his
  eye satisfied with riches; neither saith he, "For whom do I labor, and
  bereave my soul of good?" This is also vanity, yea, it is a sore
  travail.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their
  labor.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him that
  is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>Again, if two lie together, then they have heat; but how can one be
  warm alone?
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And if one prevail against him two shall withstand him; and a threefold
  cord is not quickly broken.

  <verse>13</verse><span>Better is a poor and a wise child, than an old and foolish king, who

  his kingdom becometh poor.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>I considered all the living which walk under

  </span><verse>16</verse><span>There is no end of all the people, even of all

  <verse>1</verse><span>Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to

  </span><verse>2</verse><span>Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter
  anything before God; for God is in heaven, and thou upon earth;
  therefore let thy words be few.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool's

  and not pay.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before
  the angel, that it was an error; wherefore should God be angry at thy
  voice, and destroy the work of thine hands?
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>For in the multitude of dreams and many words there are also divers
  vanities; but fear thou God.

  <verse>10</verse><span>He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that

  <verse>13</verse><span>There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely, riches

  </span><verse>19</verse><span>Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given

  <verse>1</verse><span>There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is common

  wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet God giveth him
  not power to eat thereof, but a stranger eateth it; this is vanity, and
  it is an evil disease.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>If a man beget a hundred children, and live many years, so that the
  days of his years be many, and his soul be not filled with good, and
  also that he have no burial; I say, that an untimely birth is better

  </span><verse>4</verse><span>For he cometh in with vanity, and departeth in darkness, and his name
  shall be covered with darkness.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>Moreover he hath not seen the sun, nor known anything; this hath more
  rest than the other.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>Yea, though he
  live a thousand years twice told, yet hath he seen no good; do not all go
  to one place?
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>All the labor of man is for his

 <chapter>7
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>A good name is better than precious ointment; and the day of death than
  the day of one's birth.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of
  feasting; for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to
  his heart.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>Sorrow is better than laughter; for by the sadness of the countenance
  the heart is made better.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of
  fools is in the house of mirth.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the
  song of fools;
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>for as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the
  fool; this also is vanity.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the
  heart.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof; and the
  patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry; for anger resteth in the bosom
  of fools.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>Say not thou, "What is the cause that the former days were better than
  these?" For thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>Wisdom is good with an inheritance; and by it there is profit to them
  that see the sun.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>For wisdom is a defense, and money is a defense; but the excellency of
  knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them that have it.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>Consider the work of God; for who can make that straight, which he hath
  made crooked?
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity

  that man should find nothing after him.

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>All things have I seen in the days of my vanity; there is a just man
  that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that
  prolongeth his life in his wickedness.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>Be not righteous overmuch, neither make thyself overwise; why shouldest
  thou destroy thyself?
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>Be not overmuch wicked, neither be thou foolish; why shouldest thou die
  before thy time?
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this

  <verse>21</verse><span>Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy

  </span><verse>27</verse><span>Behold, this have I found, saith the
  Preacher, counting one by one, to find out the account;
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not; one
  man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not
  found.

  Keep the king's commandment

 <chapter>8
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Who is as the wise man? And who knoweth the interpretation of a thing?
  A man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face
  shall be changed.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>I counsel thee to keep the king's commandment, and that in regard of
  the oath of God.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>Be not hasty to go out of his sight; stand not in an evil thing; for he
  doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>Where the word of a king is, there is power; and who may say unto him,
  "What doest thou?"
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>Whoso keeps the commandment shall feel no evil thing; and a wise man's
  heart discerneth both time and judgment.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the
  misery of man is great upon him.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>For he knoweth not that which shall be; for who can tell him when it
  shall be?
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit;
  neither hath he power in the day of death; and there is no discharge in
  that war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done
  under the sun; there is a time wherein one man ruleth over another to
  his own hurt.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of
  the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done;
  this is also vanity.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily,
  therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>Though a sinner do evil a hundred times, and his days be prolonged, yet
  surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear
  before him;
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>but it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his
  days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth not before God.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just men,
  unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there
  be wicked men, to whom it happeneth according to the work of the
  righteous; I said that this also is vanity.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the
  sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry; for that shall abide
  with him of his labor the days of his life, which God giveth him under
  the sun.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that
  is done upon the earth; (for also there is that neither day nor night
  seeth sleep with his eyes)
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work
  that is done under the sun; because though a man labor to seek it out,
  yet he shall not find it; yea further; though a wise man think to know
  it, yet shall he not be able to find it.

 <chapter>9

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this, that
  the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God; no
  man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before them.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>All things come alike to all; there is one event to the righteous, and
  to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him
  that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not; as is the good, so is
  the sinner; and he that sweareth, as he that feareth an oath.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun, that
  there is one event unto all; yea, also the heart of the sons of men is
  full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after
  that they go to the dead.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope; for a living dog is
  better than a dead lion.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>For the living know that they shall die; but
  the dead know not anything, neither have they anymore a reward; for the
  memory of them is forgotten.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>Also their love,
  and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they
  anymore a portion forever in anything that is done under the sun.

 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life
  of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all the days of
  thy vanity; for that is thy portion in this life, and in thy labor which
  thou takest under the sun.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is
  no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither
  thou goest.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift,
  nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet
  riches to men of understanding, nor yet favor to men of skill; but time
  and chance happeneth to them all.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>For man also knoweth not his time; as the fishes that are taken in an
  evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so are the sons
  of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it seemed great unto
  me;
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>there was a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great
  king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom
  delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>Then said I, "Wisdom is better than strength; nevertheless the poor
  man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard."
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him that

  good.

  </span><verse>3</verse><span>Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth
  him, and he saith to everyone that he is a fool.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place;

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as an error which

  </span><verse>13</verse><span>The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness; and the end of

  hand; for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that,
  or whether they both shall be alike good.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to
  behold the sun;
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>but if a man live many years, and rejoice in them all; yet let him
  remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All that cometh
  is vanity.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the
  days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight
  of thine eyes; but know thou, that for all these things God will bring
  thee into judgment.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy
  flesh; for childhood and youth are vanity.

  Remember thy creator in thy youth

  <verse>1</verse><span>Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days
  come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no
  pleasure in them;
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>while the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not
  darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain;
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong
  men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few,
  and those that look out of the windows be darkened.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the
  grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all
  the daughters of music shall be brought low;
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall
  be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper
  shall be a burden, and desire shall fail; because man goeth to his long
  home, and the mourners go about the streets;
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the
  pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was; and the spirit shall
  return unto God who gave it.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher; all is vanity.

  <verse>9</verse><span>And moreover, because the Preacher was wise, he still taught the people
  knowledge; yea, he gave good heed, and sought out, and set in order many
  proverbs.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>The Preacher sought to find out acceptable words; and that which was
  written was upright, even words of truth.

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails fastened by the
  masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And further, by these, my son, be admonished; of making many books
  there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter. Fear God, and keep his
  commandments; for this is the whole duty of man.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing,
  whether it be good, or whether it be evil.
