 <journalaccount>
  <block><span>
   This edition of THE NEW TESTAMENT increases readability by modernizing
   the page layout. The text is formatted into standard paragraphs and white
   space and other modern tools (section headers, bullet lists, etc.) are
   used to help with readability. Chapter and verse references are visually
   subdued so as to not distract from the message.
  </span></block>

  <block><span>
   This edition uses the text from the Inspired Version, or Joseph Smith
   Translation (JST), of the Bible, while using King James Version verse
   numbers for convenience. Significant changes in wording between the KJV
   text and the JST text are indicated by an
   </span><under><span>underline</span></under><span>, and the KJV text appears in the margin.
   Significant additions not found in the KJV text are indicated by a
   </span><dunder><span>dashed underline</span></dunder><span>.
  </span></block>

  <block><span>
   Many text differences between the JST and the KJV have little to no impact
   on the meaning, such as:

   Because the goal of this version is to increase readability, simple
   differences such as these are not indicated. When a change is indicated,
   there is a significant difference that should be given attention.

  <block><span>
   In several places, the JST reorders verses. Where this occurs, the KJV
   verse numbers are inside parenthesis to denote the out of order numbering
   is intentional.

    <verse>18</verse><span>Now,
    </span><dunder><span>as it is written</span></dunder><span>, the birth of
    Jesus Christ was on this wise. After his mother, Mary, was espoused to
    Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy
    Ghost.
    </span><verse>19</verse><span>Then Joseph, her husband, being a just
    man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her
    away privily.
    </span><verse>20</verse><span>But while he thought on these
    things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a vision,
    saying:
    </span><quote><span>
     Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife; for
     that which is conceived in her, is of the Holy Ghost.
     </span><verse>21</verse><span>And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt
     call his name Jesus; for he shall save his people from their sins.

    <verse>9</verse><span>When they had heard the king, they departed; and lo, the star which

    where the young child was.
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child, with
    Mary his mother, and fell down and worshiped him. And when they had
    opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts: gold, and
    frankincense, and myrrh.
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to
    Herod, they departed into their own country another way.

     have their reward.
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast

    <dunder><span>And, again, I say unto you, go ye into the world, and care not for the
    world; for the world will hate you, and will
    persecute you, and will turn you out of their synagogues. Nevertheless, ye shall go forth from house to house, teaching
    the people; and I will go before you. And your
    heavenly Father will provide for you, whatsoever things ye need for food, what ye shall eat; and for raiment, what ye shall

    <block>
     <verse>25</verse><span>Therefore I say unto you, take no thought for your life, what ye shall
     eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your bodies, what ye shall put
     on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?
     </span><verse>26</verse><span>Behold the fowls of the air, for they sow not, neither do they reap,
     nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them.
     Are ye not much better than they?

     <dunder><span>Wherefore take no thought for these things, but keep my commandments wherewith I have commanded you</span></dunder><span>.
     </span><verse>27</verse><span>For which of you by taking thought can add one
     cubit unto his stature?
     </span><verse>28</verse><span>And why take ye thought
     for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil
     not, neither do they spin.
     </span><verse>29</verse><span>And yet I say unto
     you that even Solomon, in all his glory, was not arrayed like one of
     these.
     </span><verse>30</verse><span>Therefore, if God so clothe the grass of
     the field, which today is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven,
     </span><under>
      <note><span>shall he not much more clothe you, O ye</span></note><span>how much more will he not provide for you, if ye are not</span></under><span>
     of little faith.</span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>31</verse><span>Therefore take no thought, saying, "What shall
     we eat?" or, "What shall we drink?" or, "Wherewithal shall we be clothed?"
     </span><dunder><span>Why is it that ye murmur among yourselves, saying, "We cannot obey thy word because ye have not all
     these things," and seek to excuse yourselves, saying that</span></dunder><span>
     after all these things
     do the Gentiles seek.</span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>32</verse><span>Behold, I say unto you that your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need
     of all these things.
     </span><verse>33</verse><dunder><span>Wherefore, seek not the things of this world</span></dunder><span>
     but seek ye first
     </span><dunder><span>to build up</span></dunder><span>
     the kingdom of God, and
     </span><dunder><span>to establish</span></dunder><span>
     his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.
     </span><verse>34</verse><span>Take, therefore, no thought for the morrow; for
     the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto
     the day shall be the evil thereof.</span></block>

     <verse>6</verse><under>
      <note><span>give not</span></note><span>for it is not meet to give</span></under><span>

   The authority of Jesus

   <verse>23</verse><span>And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders
   of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, "By what
   authority doest thou these things? And who gave thee this authority?"
   </span><verse>24</verse><span>And Jesus answered and said unto them:</span><quote><span>
    I also will ask you one thing, which if ye tell me, I, likewise, will tell
    you by what authority I do these things.

   And they reasoned with themselves, saying, "If we shall say, 'From
   heaven;' he will say unto us, 'Why did ye not then believe him?'
   </span><verse>26</verse><span>But if we shall say, 'Of men;' we fear the
   people." For all people held John as a prophet.
   </span><verse>27</verse><span>And they answered Jesus, and said, "We cannot
   tell." And he said:

    Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.

     Verily I say unto you, that the publicans and the harlots shall go into

     sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding; and

    <block>
     <verse>4</verse><span>Again he sent forth other servants, saying, "Tell them that are bidden,

   <verse>1</verse><span>And he entered again into the synagogue; and
   there was a man there which had a withered hand.
   </span><verse>2</verse><span>And they watched him
   </span><dunder><span>to see</span></dunder><span>
   whether he
   would heal him on the Sabbath day; that they might accuse him.
   </span><verse>3</verse><span>And he said unto the man which had the withered

   <verse>4</verse><span>And he said unto them, "Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath days, or

   <verse>5</verse><span>And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved
   for the hardness of their hearts, he said unto the man, "Stretch forth
   thine hand." And he stretched out his hand; and his hand was restored
   whole as the other.
   </span><verse>6</verse><span>And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the

   about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they heard what great
   things he did, came unto him.
   </span><verse>9</verse><span>And he spake unto his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him,
   because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.
   </span><verse>10</verse><span>For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to
   touch him. As many as had plagues
   </span><verse>11</verse><span>and unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and
   cried, saying, "Thou art the Son of God."
   </span><verse>12</verse><span>And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known.

   </span><verse>14</verse><span>And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might
   send them forth to preach,
   </span><verse>15</verse><span>and to have power to heal sickness, and to cast out devils.
   </span><verse>16</verse><span>And Simon he surnamed Peter;

   James the son of Alpheus, and Thaddeus, and Simon the Canaanite,

   <verse>20</verse><span>And the multitude cometh together again, so

    for they said, "He is beside himself."
   </span><verse>22</verse><span>And the
   Scribes which came down from Jerusalem, said, "He hath Beelzebub, and by

    be divided against itself, how can that kingdom stand?
    </span><verse>25</verse><span>And if a house be divided against itself, that
    house cannot stand.
    </span><verse>26</verse><span>And if Satan rise up
    against himself and be divided, he cannot stand; but speedily hath an end.
    </span><verse>27</verse><span>No man can enter into a strong man's house, and
    spoil his goods, except he will first bind the strong man, and then he
    will spoil his house.

    Hearken; behold, there went out a sower to sow;

    the wayside, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>And some fell on stony ground, where it had not
    much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of
    earth; but when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no
    root, it withered away.
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>And some fell among
    thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it; and it yielded no fruit.
    </span><verse>7</verse><span>And other seed fell on good ground, and did
    yield fruit, that sprang up and increased, and brought forth, some
    thirtyfold, and some sixty, and some an hundred.

   </span><quote><span>
    Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God; but unto
    them that are without, all these things are done in parables;

    </span><verse>28</verse><span>for the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself,
    first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.

    Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God? Or with what comparison shall

   The death of John the Baptist
  </span></heading>

  <block>
   <verse>14</verse><span>And King Herod heard of Jesus; for his name was spread abroad; and he
   said that John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore,
   mighty works do show forth themselves in him.
   </span><verse>15</verse><span>Others said that "It is Elias"; and others said that "It is a prophet,
   or as one of the prophets."
   </span><verse>16</verse><span>But when Herod heard of him, he said, "It is John whom I beheaded; he
   is risen from the dead."
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>17</verse><span>For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold
   upon John, and bound him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother
   Philip's wife; for he had married her.
   </span><verse>18</verse><span>For John
   had said unto Herod, "It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's
   wife."
   </span><verse>19</verse><span>Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against
   him, and would have killed him; but she could not.
   </span><verse>20</verse><span>For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a
   just man, and a holy
   </span><dunder><span>man, and one who feared God</span></dunder><span>
   and observed
   </span><dunder><span>to worship</span></dunder><span>
   him; and when he heard him he did many things
   </span><dunder><span>for him</span></dunder><span>, and heard him gladly.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>21</verse><span>But when Herod's birthday was come, he made a
   supper for his lords, high captains, and the chief
   </span><under>
    <note><span>estates</span></note><span>priests</span></under><span>
   of Galilee.
   </span><verse>22</verse><span>And when the daughter of Herodias came
   in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king
   said unto the damsel, "Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it
   thee."
   </span><verse>23</verse><span>And he sware unto her, "Whatsoever thou
   shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom."
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>24</verse><span>And she went forth, and said unto her mother, "What shall I ask?" And
   she said, "The head of John the Baptist."
   </span><verse>25</verse><span>And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked,
   saying, "I will that thou give me, by and by, in a charger, the head of
   John the Baptist."
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>26</verse><span>And the king was exceeding sorry; but for his oath's sake, and for
   their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her.
   </span><verse>27</verse><span>And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to
   be brought; and he went and beheaded him in the prison.
   </span><verse>28</verse><span>And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel; and the
   damsel gave it to her mother.
   </span><verse>29</verse><span>And when John's disciples heard of it, they came and took up his corpse
   and laid it in a tomb.

     Parable of the sower
    </span></heading>

    <block>
     <verse>4</verse><span>And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him out
     of every city, he spake by a parable, saying:</span><quote>
      <verse>5</verse><span>A sower went out to sow his seed; and as he sowed, some fell by the
      wayside; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it.
      </span><verse>6</verse><span>And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered
      away, because it lacked moisture.
      </span><verse>7</verse><span>And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and
      choked it.
      </span><verse>8</verse><span>And others fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an
      hundredfold.</span></quote>
    </block>

    <block>
     <verse>9</verse><span>And when he had said these things, he cried, "He who hath ears to hear,
     let him hear."
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
     And his disciples asked him, saying, "What might this parable be?"
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>And he said:
     </span><quote>
      <block><span>
       Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God; but to
       others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might
       not understand.
      </span></block>

      <block>
       <verse>11</verse><span>Now the parable is this: the seed is the word of God.
       </span><verse>12</verse><span>That which fell by the wayside are they who hear; and the devil cometh
       and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe
       and be saved.
       </span><verse>13</verse><span>That which fell on the rock are they, who, when they hear, receive the
       word with joy; and they have no root, but for a while believe, and in a
       time of temptation fall away.
       </span><verse>14</verse><span>And that which fell among the thorns are they, who, when they have
       heard, go forth and are choked with cares, and riches, and pleasures of
       life, and bring no fruit to perfection.
       </span><verse>15</verse><span>But that which fell on the good ground are they, who receive the word
       in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep what they hear,
       and bring forth fruit with patience.</span></block>

      <block>
       <verse>16</verse><span>For no man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel,
       or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick, that they
       who enter in may see the light.
       </span><verse>17</verse><span>For nothing is secret which shall not be made manifest; neither hid,
       which shall not be made known, and go abroad.</span></block>

       There was a certain rich man who had a steward; and the same was accused
       unto him, that he had wasted his goods.
       </span><verse>2</verse><span>And he
       called him, and said unto him, "How is it that I hear this of thee? Give
       an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward."
      </span></block>

      <block>
       <verse>3</verse><span>Then the steward said within himself, "What shall I do? For my lord
       taketh away from me the stewardship. I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed.
       </span><verse>4</verse><span>I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship,
       they may receive me into their houses."</span></block>

      <block>
       <verse>5</verse><span>So he called every one of his lord's debtors, and said unto the first,
       "How much owest thou unto my lord?"
       </span><verse>6</verse><span>And he said, "A hundred measures of oil." And he said unto him, "Take
       thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty."</span></block>

      <block>
       <verse>7</verse><span>Then said he to another, "And how much owest thou?" And he said, "A

       write fourscore."</span></block>

      <block>
       <verse>8</verse><span>And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely;

      <block>
       <verse>9</verse><span>And I say unto you, make to yourselves friends, of the mammon of
       unrighteousness; that when ye fail, they may receive you into
       everlasting habitations.
       </span><verse>10</verse><span>He who is faithful in that which is least, is faithful also in much;
       and he who is unjust in the least, is also unjust in much.
       </span><verse>11</verse><span>If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who
       will commit to your trust the true riches?

     </span><verse>2</verse><span>Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market, a pool which is called
     in the Hebrew tongue, Bethesda, having five porches.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>In these porches lay a great many impotent folk, of blind, halt,
     withered, waiting for the moving of the water.
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled
     the water, whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped
     in, was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.

     </span><verse>7</verse><span>The impotent man answered him, "Sir, I have no man when the water is
     troubled, to put me into the pool; but while I am coming, another

     <verse>1</verse><span>After these things Jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the
     sea of Tiberias; and on this wise showed he himself.
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and
     Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of
     his disciples.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>Simon Peter saith unto them, "I go a fishing." They say unto him, "We
     also go with thee." They went forth, and entered into a ship
     immediately; and that night they caught nothing.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>4</verse><span>But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore; but the
     disciples knew not that it was Jesus.

     him, "No."
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>6</verse><span>And he said unto them, "Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and
     ye shall find." They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw
     it for the multitude of fishes.
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, "It is the
     Lord."
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
     Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher's coat
     unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea.
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>And the other disciples came in a little ship,
     (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,)
     dragging the net with fishes.
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>As soon then as
     they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid
     thereon, and bread.
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>Jesus saith unto them,
     "Bring of the fish which ye have now caught."
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>11</verse><span>Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, a

     the net broken.
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>Jesus saith unto them, "Come and dine."

    <block><span>
     And none of the disciples durst ask him, "Who art thou?" knowing that it

     bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise.

     <verse>17</verse><span>He saith unto him the third time, "Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou

     knowest that I love thee." Jesus saith unto him:

     following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, "Lord,

     </span><verse>21</verse><span>Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, "Lord, and what shall this man do?"
     </span><verse>22</verse><span>Jesus saith unto him, "If I will that he tarry till I come, what is

       father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran,
       </span><verse>3</verse><span>and said unto him, "Get thee out of thy country,
       and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall show thee."
       </span><verse>4</verse><span>Then came he out of the land of the Chaldeans,
       and dwelt in Charran; and from thence, when his father was dead, he
       removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell.
      </span></block>

      <block>
       <verse>5</verse><span>And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his
       foot on; yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession,
       and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child.</span></block>

      <block>
       <verse>6</verse><span>And God spake on this wise, that his seed should sojourn in a strange
       land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat them
       evil four hundred years.
       </span><verse>7</verse><span>"And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge," said
       God, "and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this
       place."</span></block>

      <block>
       <verse>8</verse><span>And he gave him the covenant of circumcision; and so Abraham begat
       Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac begat Jacob; and
       Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs.
       </span><verse>9</verse><span>And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt; but God
       was with him,
       </span><verse>10</verse><span>and delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favor and
       wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor
       over Egypt and all his house.</span></block>

      <block>
       <verse>11</verse><span>Now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and Charran, and
       great affliction; and our fathers found no sustenance.
       </span><verse>12</verse><span>But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent out our
       fathers first.
       </span><verse>13</verse><span>And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren; and
       Joseph's kindred was made known unto Pharaoh.
       </span><verse>14</verse><span>Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to him, and all his
       kindred, threescore and fifteen souls.
       </span><verse>15</verse><span>So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers.
       </span><verse>16</verse><span>And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulcher that
       Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor, the father of

       </span><verse>19</verse><span>The same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and evil entreated our

       him for her own son.

       mighty in words and in deeds.</span></block>

      <block>
       <verse>23</verse><span>And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit
       his brethren the children of Israel.
       </span><verse>24</verse><span>And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him
       that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian;
       </span><verse>25</verse><span>for he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by his
       hand would deliver them; but they understood not.</span></block>

      <block>
       <verse>26</verse><span>And the next day he showed himself unto them as they strove, and would
       have set them at one again, saying, "Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye
       wrong one to another?"
       </span><verse>27</verse><span>But he that did his neighbor wrong thrust him away, saying, "Who made

      <block>
       <verse>29</verse><span>Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of
       Midian, where he begat two sons.
       </span><verse>30</verse><span>And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the
       wilderness of mount Sinai an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a
       bush.
       </span><verse>31</verse><span>When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight; and as he drew near to
       behold it, the voice of the Lord came unto him,
       </span><verse>32</verse><span>saying, "I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God
       of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." Then Moses trembled, and durst not
       behold.</span></block>

      <block>
       <verse>33</verse><span>Then said the Lord to him, "Put off thy shoes from thy feet; for the

       </span><verse>34</verse><span>I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt,

      <block>
       <verse>35</verse><span>This Moses whom they refused, saying, "Who made thee a ruler and a

       </span><verse>36</verse><span>He brought them out, after that he had showed wonders and signs in the

     eight years, and was sick of the palsy.

     </span><verse>40</verse><span>But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning

     <verse>1</verse><span>There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of

     much alms to the people, and prayed to God always.

      Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God.

     <verse>9</verse><span>On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the
     city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour.
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>And he became very hungry, and would have eaten; but while they made
     ready, he fell into a trance,
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>and saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it
     had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the
     earth;
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild
     beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>13</verse><span>And there came a voice to him, "Rise, Peter; kill, and eat."
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>But Peter said, "Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is
     common or unclean."
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>And the voice spake unto him again the second time, "What God hath
     cleansed, that call not thou common."
     </span><verse>16</verse><span>This was done thrice; and the vessel was received up again into
     heaven.

    <block>
     <verse>17</verse><span>Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen
     should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made
     inquiry for Simon's house, and stood before the gate,
     </span><verse>18</verse><span>and called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were
     lodged there.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>19</verse><span>While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him:</span><quote><span>
      Behold, three men seek thee.

      should not call any man common or unclean.
      </span><verse>29</verse><span>Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying,

      <block>
       <verse>5</verse><span>I was in the city of Joppa praying; and in a trance I saw a vision, a

     before the door kept the prison.
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>And, behold, the angel of the Lord came unto him, and a light shined in
     the prison; and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying,

     <verse>1</verse><span>Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and
     teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of
     Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch,
     and Saul.
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said:</span><quote><span>
      Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.
     </span></quote>
    </block>

    <block>
     <verse>3</verse><span>And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they
     sent them away.
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed unto Seleucia;
     and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>5</verse><span>And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the
     synagogues of the Jews; and they had also John to their minister.
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a
     certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Bar- jesus;
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent
     man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of
     God.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>8</verse><span>But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation)
     withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>9</verse><span>Then Saul, (who also is called Paul,) filled with the Holy Ghost, set
     his eyes on him,
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>and said:
     </span><quote><span>
      O full of all subtilty and all mischief, thou child of the devil, thou
      enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways
      of the Lord?
      </span><verse>11</verse><span>And now, behold, the hand of the
      Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a
      season.

    <block><span>
     And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about
     seeking some to lead him by the hand.
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>Then the
     deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the
     doctrine of the Lord.

    <block>
     <verse>13</verse><span>Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in
     Pamphylia; and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem.
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>But when they departed from
     Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the
     Sabbath day, and sat down.
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>And after the
     reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent unto
     them, saying, "Ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for
     the people, say on."
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>16</verse><span>Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said:

      <block><span>
       Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience.
       </span><verse>17</verse><span>The God of this people of Israel chose our
       fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land
       of Egypt, and with an high arm brought he them out of it.
       </span><verse>18</verse><span>And about the time for forty years suffered he
       their manners in the wilderness.
       </span><verse>19</verse><span>And when he
       had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan, he divided their land
       to them by lot.

      <block>
       <verse>20</verse><span>And after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred
       and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.
       </span><verse>21</verse><span>And afterward they desired a king; and God gave unto them Saul the son
       of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of forty years.
       </span><verse>22</verse><span>And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be their
       king; to whom also he gave testimony, and said, "I have found David the
       son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfill all my
       will."</span></block>

      <block>
       <verse>23</verse><span>Of this man's seed hath God, according to his promise, raised unto
       Israel a Savior, Jesus;
       </span><verse>24</verse><span>when John had first preached before his coming the baptism of
       repentance to all the people of Israel.
       </span><verse>25</verse><span>And as John fulfilled his course, he said, "Whom think ye that I am? I
       am not he. But, behold, there cometh one after me, whose shoes of his
       feet I am not worthy to loose."</span></block>

      <block>
       <verse>26</verse><span>Men and brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever among
       you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation sent.
       </span><verse>27</verse><span>For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew
       him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every Sabbath
       day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him.
       </span><verse>28</verse><span>And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they Pilate
       that he should be slain.
       </span><verse>29</verse><span>And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him
       down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulcher.</span></block>

      <block>
       <verse>30</verse><span>But God raised him from the dead;
       </span><verse>31</verse><span>and he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee
       to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people.
       </span><verse>32</verse><span>And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was
       made unto the fathers,
       </span><verse>33</verse><span>God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath
       raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, "Thou
       art my Son, this day have I begotten thee."
       </span><verse>34</verse><span>And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to
       return to corruption, he said on this wise, "I will give you the sure
       mercies of David."</span></block>

      <block>
       <verse>35</verse><span>Wherefore he saith also in another psalm, "Thou shalt not suffer thine
       Holy One to see corruption."
       </span><verse>36</verse><span>For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God,
       fell asleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption;
       </span><verse>37</verse><span>but he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption.</span></block>

      <block>
       <verse>38</verse><span>Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man
       is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins;

     that these words might be preached to them the next Sabbath.
     </span><verse>43</verse><span>Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious
     proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas; who, speaking to them, persuaded
     them to continue in the grace of God.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>44</verse><span>And the next Sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear
     the word of God.
     </span><verse>45</verse><span>But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and
     spake against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and
     blaspheming.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>46</verse><span>Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said:</span><quote><span>
      It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to
      you; but seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of
      everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.
      </span><verse>47</verse><span>For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, "I
      have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for
      salvation unto the ends of the earth."

     <verse>50</verse><span>But the Jews stirred up the devout and honorable women, and the chief

     <verse>1</verse><span>And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together into the
     synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great multitude both of the
     Jews and also of the Greeks believed.
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds
     evil affected against the brethren.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gave
     testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to
     be done by their hands.
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>But the multitude of the city was divided; and part held with the Jews,
     and part with the apostles.

    <block>
     <verse>5</verse><span>And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also of
     the Jews with their rulers, to use them despitefully, and to stone them,
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>they were ware of it, and fled unto Lystra and Derbe, cities of
     Lycaonia, and unto the region that lieth round about;
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>and there they preached the gospel.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>8</verse><span>And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, being a
     cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked;
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>the same heard Paul speak; who steadfastly beholding him, and
     perceiving that he had faith to be healed,
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>said with a loud voice, "Stand upright on thy feet." And he leaped and
     walked.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>11</verse><span>And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their
     voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, "The gods are come down to us
     in the likeness of men."
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because he was
     the chief speaker.
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen
     and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the
     people.

    <block>
     <verse>14</verse><span>When the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard this, they rent their
     clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out,
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>and saying:
     </span><quote>
      <block><span>
       Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you,
       and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the
       living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that
       are therein;
       </span><verse>16</verse><span>who in times past suffered all
       nations to walk in their own ways.
       </span><verse>17</verse><span>Nevertheless
       he left not himself
       without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and

     <verse>19</verse><span>And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who
     persuaded the people, and, having stoned Paul, drew him out of the city,
     supposing he had been dead.
     </span><verse>20</verse><span>Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and came
     into the city; and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe,

     many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch,
     </span><verse>22</verse><span>confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue
     in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the
     kingdom of God.
     </span><verse>23</verse><span>And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed
     with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they

     </span><verse>27</verse><span>And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they
     rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the

       Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among

     Paul's vision of the man of Macedonia

    <block>
     <verse>6</verse><span>Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia,
     and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>after they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia; but
     the Spirit suffered them not.
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>9</verse><span>And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; there stood a man of
     Macedonia and prayed him, saying, "Come over into Macedonia, and help
     us."
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavored to go into
     Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach
     the gospel unto them.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>11</verse><span>Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to
     Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis;
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>and from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of
     Macedonia, and a colony; and we were in that city abiding certain
     days.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>13</verse><span>And on the Sabbath we went out of the city by a riverside, where the
     people resorted for prayer to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto
     the women which resorted thither.
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of
     Thyatira, which worshiped God, heard us; whose heart the Lord opened,
     that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul.
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying,
     "If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house,
     and abide there." And she constrained us.

     Paul and Silas in prison

    <block>
     <verse>16</verse><span>And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed
     with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain
     by soothsaying;
     </span><verse>17</verse><span>the same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, "These men are the
     servants of the most high God, which show unto us the way of salvation."
     </span><verse>18</verse><span>And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to
     the spirit, "I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of
     her." And he came out the same hour.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>19</verse><span>And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they
     caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace unto the
     rulers,
     </span><verse>20</verse><span>and brought them to the magistrates, saying, "These men, being Jews, do
     exceedingly trouble our city,
     </span><verse>21</verse><span>and teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to
     observe, being Romans."
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>22</verse><span>And the multitude rose up together against them; and the magistrates
     rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat them.

     they cast them into prison, charging the jailer to keep them safely;
     </span><verse>24</verse><span>who, having received such a charge, thrust them
     into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>25</verse><span>And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God; and
     the prisoners heard them.
     </span><verse>26</verse><span>And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of
     the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened, and
     everyone's bands were loosed.

    <block>
     <verse>27</verse><span>And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the

     are all here."

     <verse>29</verse><span>Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell

      They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us

     <verse>1</verse><span>Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to

     reasoned with them out of the scriptures,

     again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is
     Christ.

     certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set
     all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought
     to bring them out to the people.

     the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily,
     whether those things were so.
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>Therefore many of them believed; also of honorable women which were
     Greeks, and of men, not a few.

      May we know what this new doctrine is, whereof thou speakest?

       the bounds of their habitation;

     </span><verse>24</verse><span>For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver
     shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;

     said:</span><quote><span>Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth.

      hands;
      </span><verse>27</verse><span>so that not only this our craft is in

     Sailing to Italy

    <block>
     <verse>1</verse><span>And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they
     delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius, a
     centurion of Augustus' band.
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail
     by the coasts of Asia; one Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica,
     being with us.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>3</verse><span>And the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously entreated
     Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself.
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because
     the winds were contrary.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>5</verse><span>And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came
     to Myra, a city of Lycia.
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria, sailing into Italy;
     and he put us therein.
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over
     against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over
     against Salmone;
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>and, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called the Fair
     Havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>9</verse><span>Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous,
     because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>Aand said unto them, "Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with
     hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our
     lives."
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>11</verse><span>Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the
     ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part
     advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to
     Phenice, and there to winter; which is an haven of Crete, and lieth
     toward the southwest and northwest.

     <verse>13</verse><span>And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained
     their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by Crete.
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called
     Euroclydon.
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we
     let her drive.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>16</verse><span>And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much
     work to come by the boat;
     </span><verse>17</verse><span>which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship;
     and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, strake sail, and
     so were driven.
     </span><verse>18</verse><span>And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they
     lightened the ship;
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>19</verse><span>And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the
     ship.
     </span><verse>20</verse><span>And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small
     tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken
     away.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>21</verse><span>But after long abstinence, Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and
     said:
     </span><quote>
      <block><span>
       Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete,
       and to have gained this harm and loss.
       </span><verse>22</verse><span>And now
       I exhort you to be of good cheer; for there shall be no loss of any man's
       life among you, but of the ship.

      <block>
       <verse>25</verse><span>Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer; for I believe God, that it shall be

     </span><verse>37</verse><span>And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore
     and sixteen souls.
     </span><verse>38</verse><span>And when they had eaten enough, they lightened

    <block>
     <verse>39</verse><span>And when it was day, they knew not the land; but they discovered a
     certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were
     possible, to thrust in the ship.
     </span><verse>40</verse><span>And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves unto
     the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up the mainsail to the
     wind, and made toward shore.
     </span><verse>41</verse><span>And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground;
     and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmovable, but the hinder part
     was broken with the violence of the waves.

     <verse>42</verse><span>And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them

     and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first
     into the sea, and get to land;

    <block>
     <verse>3</verse><span>And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the

     whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins

    <block><span>
     For we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham, for righteousness.

     circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in
     uncircumcision.
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>And he received the sign of
     circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet
     being uncircumcised; that he might be the father of all them that believe,
     though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto
     them also;
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>and the father of circumcision to
     them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps
     of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised.

    <block>
     <verse>13</verse><span>For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to

    <block>
     <verse>19</verse><span>And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead,

     </span><verse>20</verse><span>he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong

     </span><verse>21</verse><span>and being fully persuaded, that what he had promised, he was able also
     to perform.
     </span><verse>22</verse><span>And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.

    <block>
     <verse>23</verse><span>Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;

     sin is not imputed to those who have no law.
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam to Moses,
     even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's
     transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.
     </span><dunder><span>For I say, that through the offense, death reigned over all.</span></dunder>
     <verse>15</verse><span>But the offense is not
     as the free gift, for the gift aboundeth. For, if through the offense of
     one, many be dead; much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, hath
     abounded by one man, Jesus Christ, unto many.
     </span><verse>16</verse><span>And not as, by one that sinned, is the gift;
     for the judgment is by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many
     offenses unto justification.
     </span><verse>17</verse><span>For if by one
     man's offense death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance

     obedience of one shall many be made righteous.
     </span><verse>20</verse><span>Moreover the law entered, that the offense might abound. But where sin
     abounded, grace did much more abound;

     </span><dunder><span>in times past</span></dunder><span>
     yielded your

     yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.

    <block>
     <verse>1</verse><span>Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that
     know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man
     </span><dunder><span>only</span></dunder><span>
     as
     long as he liveth?
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>For the woman which hath a
     husband is bound by the law to her husband only as long as he liveth; for
     if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>So then if, while her husband liveth, she be
     married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress; but if her
     husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress,
     though she be married to another man.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>4</verse><span>Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body
     of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is
     raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>5</verse><span>For when we were in the flesh, the motions of
     sin, which were
     </span><dunder><span>not</span></dunder><span>
     according to the law, did work in our members
     to bring forth fruit unto death.
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>But now we are
     delivered from the law wherein we were held, being dead
     </span><under>
      <note><span>wherein we were held</span></note><span>to the law</span></under><span>,
      that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the
      letter.
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>What shall we say then? Is the law sin?
     God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law; for I had not known
     lust, except the law had said, "Thou shalt not covet."
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>But sin, taking occasion by the commandment,
     wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was
     dead.

    <block>
     <verse>9</verse><span>For once I was alive without

     the law, but when the commandment
     </span><dunder><span>of Christ</span></dunder><span>
     came, sin revived, and I died.
     </span><verse>10</verse><dunder><span>And when I believed not</span></dunder><span>
     the commandment
     </span><dunder><span>of Christ which came</span></dunder><span>, which was ordained to life, I found it
     </span><dunder><span>condemned me</span></dunder><span>
     unto death.
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>For sin, taking
     occasion,
     </span><under>
      <note><span>by the commandment</span></note><span>denied the commandment</span></under><span>, and deceived me; and by it I was
      slain.
     </span><verse>12</verse><dunder><span>Nevertheless, I found</span></dunder><span>
     the law to be holy, and the commandment to be holy, and just, and good.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>13</verse><span>Was then that which is good made death unto me?
     God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin
     </span><dunder><span>by that which is good</span></dunder><span>
     working death in me; that sin, by the
     commandment, might become exceeding sinful.

     is spiritual;
     </span><dunder><span>but when I was under law</span></dunder><span>, I was yet carnal, sold under sin.
     </span><verse>15</verse><dunder><span>But now I am spiritual; for that which I am commanded to do, I do;</span></dunder>
     <under><span>and that which I am commanded not to allow, I allow not.
      </span><verse>16</verse><note><span>for that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not, but what I hate, that do I. If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law this it is good.</span></note><span>For what I know is not right, I would not do; for that which is sin, I hate. For then I do not that which I would not allow, I consent unto the law, that it is good; and I am not condemned.</span></under>

     <verse>17</verse><span>Now then, it is no more I that do sin; but
     </span><dunder><span>I seek to subdue that</span></dunder><span>
     sin which dwelleth in me.
     </span><verse>18</verse><span>For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh,
     dwelleth no good thing; for to will is present with me, but to perform
     that which is good I find not,
     </span><dunder><span>only in Christ</span></dunder><span>.
     </span><verse>19</verse><span>For the good that I would have done
     </span><dunder><span>when under the law, I find not to be good; therefore</span></dunder><span>, I do it not.
     </span><dunder><span>But the evil which I would not do under the law, I find to be good; that, I

     </span><verse>3</verse><span>For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh,
     God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin,
     condemned sin in the flesh;

     </span><verse>14</verse><span>For as many as are led by the Spirit of God,

     </span><verse>15</verse><span>For ye have not received the

     adoption; whereby we cry, "Abba, Father."
     </span><verse>16</verse><span>The

    <block>
     <verse>18</verse><span>For I reckon that the sufferings of this

     </span><verse>19</verse><span>For the earnest expectation of
     the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.
     </span><verse>20</verse><span>For the creature was made subject to
     </span><under>
      <note><span>vanity</span></note><span>tribulation</span></under><span>
     not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected

     shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious
     liberty of the children of God.

     </span><verse>23</verse><span>And not only they, but ourselves also,
     which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within
     ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.
     </span><verse>24</verse><span>For we are saved by hope; but hope that is seen
     is not hope; for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?

     </span><verse>30</verse><span>Moreover, him whom he did predestinate, him he also called; and him

    <block>
     <verse>34</verse><span>Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is

     <verse>1</verse><span>Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto

     </span><verse>2</verse><span>Nevertheless,
     </span><dunder><span>I say</span></dunder><span>, to avoid
     fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her
     own husband.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>Let the husband render unto the
     wife due benevolence; and likewise also the wife unto the husband.
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>The wife hath not power of her own body, but the

     ye not one from the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye
     may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that
     Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>And now what I speak is by permission, and not by commandment.
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>For I would that all men were even as myself. But every man hath his
     proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>8</verse><span>I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, it is good for them if
     they abide even as I.
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>But if they cannot abide, let them marry; for it is better to marry
     than that any should commit sin.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>10</verse><span>And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord: Let not the
     wife depart from her husband;
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>but if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her
     husband; but let not the husband put away his wife.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>12</verse><span>But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that
     believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her
     away.
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>And the woman which hath a husband that believeth not, and if he be
     pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the
     unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband; else were your children
     unclean; but now are they holy.
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is
     not under bondage in such cases; but God hath called us to peace.
     </span><verse>16</verse><span>For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? Or
     how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife?
    </span></block>

     everyone, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.
     </span><verse>18</verse><span>Is any man called being circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised.
     Is any called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised.
     </span><verse>19</verse><span>Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping
     of the commandments of God.

     freeman; likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ's
     servant.
     </span><verse>23</verse><span>Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.

     <verse>25</verse><span>Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of
     the Lord; yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the

     </span><verse>26</verse><span>I suppose therefore that
     this is good for the present distress, for a man so to remain that he may
     do greater good.
     </span><verse>27</verse><span>Art thou bound unto a wife?
     Seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? Seek not a wife.
     </span><verse>28</verse><span>But if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if
     a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless, such shall have trouble
     in the flesh. For I spare you
     </span><dunder><span>not</span></dunder><span>.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>29</verse><dunder><span>But I speak unto you who are called unto the ministry.</span></dunder><span>
     For this I
     say, brethren, the time that remaineth is but short,
     </span><dunder><span>that ye shall be sent forth unto the ministry</span></dunder><span>. Even they who have
     wives, shall be as though they had none;
     </span><dunder><span>for ye are called and chosen to do the Lord's work</span></dunder><span>.
     </span><verse>30</verse><span>And it shall be with them who weep, as though
     they wept not; and them who rejoice, as though they rejoiced not, and them
     who buy, as though they possessed not;
     </span><verse>31</verse><span>and them
     who use this world, as not using it; for the fashion of this world passeth
     away.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>32</verse><dunder><span>But I would, brethren, that ye magnify your calling</span></dunder><span>. I would have
     you without carefulness. For he who is unmarried, careth for the things
     that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord;
     </span><dunder><span>therefore, he prevaileth</span></dunder><span>.
     </span><verse>33</verse><span>But he who is
     married, careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please
     his wife;
     </span><dunder><span>therefore, there is a difference, for he is hindered</span></dunder><span>.
     </span><verse>34</verse><span>There is a
     difference also, between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth
     for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in
     spirit; but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how
     she may please her husband.
     </span><verse>35</verse><span>And this I speak
     for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that
     which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.

     pass the flower of age, and need so require, let him do what he
     </span><under>
      <note><span>will</span></note><span>hath promised</span></under><span>, he sinneth not; let them marry.
     </span><verse>37</verse><span>Nevertheless he that standeth steadfast in his
     heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so
     decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.
     </span><verse>38</verse><span>So then he that giveth
     </span><under>
      <note><span>her</span></note><span>himself</span></under><span>
     in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth

     </span><verse>11</verse><span>and through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom
     Christ died?
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak
     conscience, ye sin against Christ.

     </span><verse>22</verse><span>To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak; I am made all
     things to all men, that I might by all means save some.

     </span><verse>4</verse><span>Every
     man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoreth his head.
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with
     her head uncovered dishonoreth her head; for that is even all one as if
     she were shaven.
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>For if the woman be not
     covered, let her also be shorn; but if it be a shame for a woman to be
     shorn or shaven, let her be covered.
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>For a man
     indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory
     of God; but the woman is the glory of the man.
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>For the man is not of the woman; but the woman
     of the man.

    <block>
     <verse>23</verse><span>For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you,
     that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took
     bread;
     </span><verse>24</verse><span>and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, "Take, eat; this
     is my body, which is broken for you; this do in remembrance of me."
     </span><verse>25</verse><span>After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying,
     "This cup is the new testament in my blood; this do ye, as oft as ye
     drink it, in remembrance of me.

     drink of that cup.
     </span><verse>29</verse><span>For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh
     condemnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.
     </span><verse>30</verse><span>For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.

     were hearing, where were the smelling?
     </span><verse>18</verse><span>But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as
     it hath pleased him.
     </span><verse>19</verse><span>And if they were all one member, where were the body?

     again the head to the feet, "I have no need of you."
     </span><verse>22</verse><span>Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more
     feeble, are necessary;
     </span><verse>23</verse><span>and those members of the body, which we think to be less honorable,
     upon these we bestow more abundant honor; and our uncomely parts
     have more abundant comeliness.
     </span><verse>24</verse><span>For our comely parts have no need; but God hath tempered the body
     together, having given more abundant honor to that part which
     lacked;
     </span><verse>25</verse><span>that there should be no schism in the body; but that the members
     should have the same care one for another.

     unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.

     <verse>3</verse><span>For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received,
     how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>and that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day
     according to the scriptures;
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>and that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve;
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>after that, he was seen of about five hundred brethren at once; of
     whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen
     asleep.
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>After that, he was seen of James, then of all the apostles.

    <block>
     <verse>8</verse><span>And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.

     an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>But by the grace of God I am what I am; and his grace which was
     bestowed upon me was not in vain; for I labored more abundantly than
     they all; yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.

     <verse>12</verse><span>Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some
     among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not
     risen;
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>and if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your
     faith is also vain.
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have
     testified of God that he raised up Christ; whom he raised not up, if
     so be that the dead rise not.
     </span><verse>16</verse><span>For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised;
     </span><verse>17</verse><span>and if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your
     sins.
     </span><verse>18</verse><span>Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.
     </span><verse>19</verse><span>If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most

    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>20</verse><span>But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits
     of them that slept.
     </span><verse>21</verse><span>For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of
     the dead.
     </span><verse>22</verse><span>For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.
     </span><verse>23</verse><span>But every man in his own order; Christ the firstfruits; afterward
     they that are Christ's at his coming.
     </span><verse>24</verse><span>Afterward cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the
     kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all
     rule, and all authority and power.
     </span><verse>25</verse><span>For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.
     </span><verse>26</verse><span>The last enemy, death, shall be destroyed.
     </span><verse>27</verse><span>For he saith, when it is manifest that he hath put all things under
     his feet, and that all things are put under, he is excepted of the
     Father who did put all things under him.
     </span><verse>28</verse><span>And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son
     also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that
     God may be all in all.

     </span><verse>31</verse><span>I protest

     </span><verse>32</verse><span>If after the manner of men I have fought
     with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not?

     body do they come?"
     </span><verse>36</verse><span>Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it
     die;
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>37</verse><span>and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not
     that body which shall be, but grain, it may be of wheat, or some
     other;
     </span><verse>38</verse><span>but God giveth it a body as it hath
     pleased him, and to every seed his own body.
     </span><verse>39</verse><span>All flesh is not the same flesh; but there
     is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of
     fishes, and another of birds.
     </span><verse>40</verse><span>Also
     celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial,
     </span><dunder><span>and bodies telestial</span></dunder><span>;
     but the glory of the celestial, one; and the terrestrial, another;
     </span><dunder><span>and the telestial, another</span></dunder><span>.
     </span><verse>41</verse><span>There is one glory
     of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the
     stars; for one star differeth from another star in glory.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>42</verse><span>So also is the resurrection of the dead:
     </span><dot><span>it is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption;</span></dot>
     <dot>
      <verse>43</verse><span>it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory;</span></dot>
     <dot><span>it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;</span></dot>
     <dot>
      <verse>44</verse><span>it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body.</span></dot>
    </block>

    <block><span>
     There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.
     </span><verse>45</verse><span>And so it is written, the first man Adam
     was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.
     </span><verse>46</verse><span>Howbeit, that which is natural first, and
     not that which is spiritual; but afterwards, that which is spiritual;
     </span><verse>47</verse><span>the first man is of the earth, earthy; the
     second man is the Lord from heaven.
     </span><verse>48</verse><span>As is
     the earthy, such are they also that are earthy; and as is the
     heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.
     </span><verse>49</verse><span>And as we have borne the image of the
     earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>50</verse><span>Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the
     kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.
     </span><verse>51</verse><span>Behold, I show you a mystery; we shall not all sleep, but we shall
     all be changed,
     </span><verse>52</verse><span>in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the sound of the last
     trump; for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised
     incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
     </span><verse>53</verse><span>For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must
     put on immortality.
     </span><verse>54</verse><span>So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this
     mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass
     the saying that is written, "Death is swallowed up in victory."
     </span><verse>55</verse><span>O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?
     </span><verse>56</verse><span>The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.
     </span><verse>57</verse><span>But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord
     Jesus Christ.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>58</verse><span>Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast, unmovable, always

     anything, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgive I it in the
     person of Christ;

     <verse>12</verse><span>Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and a

     </span><verse>13</verse><span>I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother;
     but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into
     Macedonia.

     every place.
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>For we are unto God a sweet savor of Christ, in them that are
     saved, and in them that perish;
     </span><verse>16</verse><span>to the one we are the savor of death unto death; and to the other
     the savor of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?
     </span><verse>17</verse><span>For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God; but as of
     sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in

     <verse>1</verse><span>Do we begin again to commend ourselves? Or need we, as some others,
     epistles of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from
     you?
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all
     men;
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ
     ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the
     living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshly tables of the
     heart.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>4</verse><span>And such trust have we through Christ toward God.
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of
     ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of
     the letter, but of the Spirit; for the letter killeth, but the
     Spirit giveth life.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>7</verse><span>But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones,
     was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly
     behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which
     glory was to be done away;
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>how shall not the ministration of the Spirit be rather glorious?
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth
     the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect,
     by reason of the glory that excelleth.
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which
     remaineth is glorious.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>12</verse><span>Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of
     speech;
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>and not as Moses, which put a veil over his face, that the children
     of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is
     abolished;
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>but their minds were blinded; for until this day remaineth the same
     veil untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which veil is
     done away in Christ.
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their
     heart.
     </span><verse>16</verse><span>Nevertheless, when their heart shall turn to the Lord, the veil
     shall be taken away.
     </span><verse>17</verse><span>Now the Lord is that Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is,
     there is liberty.
     </span><verse>18</verse><span>But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the
     Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as
     by the Spirit of the Lord.

     have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in
     craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but, by
     manifestation of the truth, commending ourselves to
     every man's conscience in the sight of God.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them
     that are lost;

     the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine

     Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake.

     <verse>1</verse><span>For we know that, if our earthly house of this tabernacle were

     eternal in the heavens.
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with
     our house which is from heaven;
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened; not
     for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality
     might be swallowed up of life.
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also
     hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.

     </span><verse>7</verse><span>(for we walk by faith, not by sight;)
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>we are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the
     body, and to be present with the Lord.
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>Wherefore we labor, that, whether present or absent, we may be
     accepted of him.

     we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to

     because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then are all dead;
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>and he died for all, that they which live
     should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died

     <verse>5</verse><span>For when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we

     fears.
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down,
     comforted us by the coming of Titus;
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>and not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was
     comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your
     mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more.
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though
     I did repent; for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you
     sorry, though it were but for a season.
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to
     repentance; for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye
     might receive damage by us in nothing;
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>for godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented
     of; but the sorrow of the world of the world worketh death.
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>For behold this selfsame thing that ye sorrowed after a godly sort,
     what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of
     yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what
     vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge! In all things ye

     bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>how that in a great trial of affliction, the abundance of their joy
     and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>For to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power they
     were willing of themselves;
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>praying us with much entreaty that we would receive the gift, and
     take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>And this they did, not as we required, but first gave their own
     selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>Insomuch that we desired Titus that as he had begun, so he would
     also finish in you the same grace also.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>7</verse><span>Therefore, as ye abound in everything, in faith, and utterance, and
     knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye
     abound in this grace also.
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of
     others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>9</verse><span>For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was
     rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty
     might be rich.
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>And herein I give my advice; for this is expedient for you, who
     have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year
     ago.
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a
     readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that
     which ye have.
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to
     that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>For I mean not that other men be eased, and ye be burdened;
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>but by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a
     supply for their want, that their
     abundance also may be a supply for your want; that there may be equality;

     </span><verse>19</verse><span>and not that only, but who was also chosen
     of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is
     administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and declaration of

     </span><verse>20</verse><span>avoiding this, that no man
     should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us;
     </span><verse>21</verse><span>providing for honest things, not only in
     the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.
     </span><verse>22</verse><span>And we have sent with them our brother,
     whom we have proved diligent in many things, but now much more
     diligent.
     </span><verse>23</verse><dunder><span>Therefore we send him unto you, in consequence of the great confidence which
     we have in you, that you will receive the things concerning you, to the glory of
     Christ</span></dunder><span>; whether we send by the hand of Titus, my partner and fellow
     laborer, or our brethren, the messengers of the churches.

     toward you;
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>but I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present with
     that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which
     think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh;
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>(for the weapons of our warfare are
     not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of
     strongholds;)
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>casting down imaginations, and
     every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God,

     </span><verse>8</verse><span>For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the
     Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I
     should not be ashamed:
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>that I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.

     <verse>12</verse><span>For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves

     </span><verse>13</verse><span>But we will not boast of things without our measure, but according
     to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a
     measure to reach even unto you.
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we
     reached not unto you; for we are come as far as to you also in

     </span><verse>15</verse><span>not boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other men's

     you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to

     </span><verse>3</verse><span>But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through
     his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity
     that is in Christ.

     well bear with me.

     measure.
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart

     </span><verse>9</verse><span>And he said unto me, "My grace is sufficient for thee;" for my
     strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I
     rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest
     upon me.
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in

     </span><verse>12</verse><span>Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all
     patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except

     <verse>14</verse><span>Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be

     abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.

     there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings,

     second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore
     have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not
     spare;
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward
     is not weak, but is mighty in you.
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he lived by the
     power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with
     him by the power of God toward you.

    <block>
     <verse>5</verse><span>Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own

     you, except ye be reprobates?
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates.
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear
     approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be
     as reprobates.
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong; and this also
     we wish, even your perfection.
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I

     <verse>1</verse><span>Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with
     Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel
     which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were
     of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to
     be circumcised.
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>Notwithstanding, there were some brought in by false brethren
     unawares, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have
     in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage;
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>to whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the
     truth of the gospel might continue with you.
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>But of those who seemed to be somewhat, whatsoever they were, it
     maketh no matter to me; God accepteth no man's person; for they who
     seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me;
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>but contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the
     uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the
     circumcision was unto Peter;
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>(for he that wrought effectually in Peter
     to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me
     toward the Gentiles;)
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>and when James,
     Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that
     was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of
     fellowship; that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the
     circumcision.
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>Only they would that we

     <verse>11</verse><span>But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face,
     because he was to be blamed.
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>For before that certain came from James, he did eat with Gentiles;
     but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing
     them which were of the circumcision.
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that
     Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the
     truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, "If thou,
     being a Jew, livest after the manner of the Gentiles, and not as do
     the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the

     </span><verse>16</verse><span>Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not,

     </span><verse>17</verse><span>And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God
     in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after,
     cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.

     <verse>1</verse><span>And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this
     world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit
     that now worketh in the children of disobedience;
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the
     lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh, and of the
     mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he
     loved us,
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with
     Christ, (by grace ye are saved;)
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>and hath raised us up together, and made us to sit together in
     heavenly places in Christ Jesus;
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his
     grace, in his kindness toward us, through Christ Jesus.
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of
     yourselves; but it is the gift of God;
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>not of works, lest any man should boast.
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>For we are
     his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God
     hath before ordained that we should walk in them.

    <block>
     <verse>11</verse><span>Wherefore remember, that ye were in time past Gentiles in the
     flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the
     Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>that at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the
     commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise,
     having no hope, and without God in the world;
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>but now, in Christ Jesus, ye who sometimes were far off are made
     nigh by the blood of Christ.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>14</verse><span>For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down
     the middle wall of partition between us;
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of
     commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of
     twain one new man, so making peace;
     </span><verse>16</verse><span>and that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross,
     having slain the enmity thereby;
     </span><verse>17</verse><span>and came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them
     that were nigh.
     </span><verse>18</verse><span>For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the
     Father.

     citizens with the saints, and of the household of God;

     Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone;

     Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by
     death.

     </span><verse>23</verse><span>Now I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to
     be with Christ; which is far better;

     obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.

     that ye had heard he had been sick.
     </span><verse>27</verse><span>For indeed he was sick nigh unto death; but God had mercy on him;
     and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon

     regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.

     <verse>12</verse><span>Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect;
     but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am
     apprehended of Christ Jesus.
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended; but this one
     thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching
     forth unto those things which are before,
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in
     Christ Jesus.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>15</verse><span>Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded; and if in
     anything ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto
     you.
     </span><verse>16</verse><span>Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the

     even weeping, as the enemies of the cross of Christ;

     grace unto you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord
     Jesus Christ.

    <block>
     <verse>2</verse><span>We give thanks always, making mention of you all, in our

     </span><verse>3</verse><span>Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labor of
     love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the
     sight of God and our Father;
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>5</verse><span>For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in
     power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know
     what manner of men we were among you for your sake.
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received
     the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost;
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>so that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and
     Achaia.
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in
     Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith toward
     God is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak anything.
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>For they themselves show of us what manner of entering in we
     had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the
     living and true God;
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the
     dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to
     come.
    </span></block>

    <chapter>2
    </chapter>

    <block>
     <verse>1</verse><span>For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that
     it was not in vain;
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>but
     even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully
     entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to
     speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>For our exhortation was not of deceit,
     nor of uncleanness, not in guile;
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>but as
     we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so
     we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts.
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>For neither at any time used we
     flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloak of covetousness; God is
     witness;
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>nor of men sought we glory,
     neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been
     burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>But we were gentle among you, even as a
     nurse cherisheth her children;
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>so being
     affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted
     unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls,
     because you were dear unto us.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>9</verse><span>For ye remember, brethren, our labor and travail; for laboring
     night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of
     you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and
     unblamably we behaved ourselves among you that believe;
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>as ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one
     of you, as a father doth his children,
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>that ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his
     kingdom and glory.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>13</verse><span>For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when
     ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it
     not as the word of men, but, as it is in truth, the word of God,
     which effectually worketh also in you that believe.
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which
     in Judea are in Christ Jesus; for ye also have suffered like
     things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews;
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and
     have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to
     all men;
     </span><verse>16</verse><span>forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be
     saved, to fill up their sins always; for the wrath is coming
     upon them to the uttermost.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>17</verse><span>But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in
     presence, not in heart, endeavored the more abundantly to see
     your face with great desire.
     </span><verse>18</verse><span>Wherefore we would have come unto you,
     even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us.
     </span><verse>19</verse><span>For what is our hope, or joy, or crown
     of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus
     Christ at his coming?
     </span><verse>20</verse><span>For ye are our
     glory and joy.
    </span></block>

    <chapter>3
    </chapter>

    <block>
     <verse>1</verse><span>Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good
     to be left at Athens alone;
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>and sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our
     fellow -laborer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and
     to comfort you concerning your faith;
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>that no man should be moved by these afflictions; for
     yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we
     should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye know.
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know
     your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and
     our labor be in vain.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>6</verse><span>But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us
     good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good
     remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also
     to see you;
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our
     affliction and distress by your faith;
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>for now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the
     joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face,
     and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>11</verse><span>Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,
     direct our way unto you.
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward
     another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you;
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>to the end he may establish your hearts unblamable in holiness
     before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus
     Christ with all his saints.
    </span></block>

    <chapter>4
    </chapter>

    <block>
     <verse>1</verse><span>Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by
     the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to
     walk and to please God, so ye would abound more and more.
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye
     should abstain from fornication;
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in
     sanctification and honor;
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which
     know not God;
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>that no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter;
     because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also
     have forewarned you and testified.
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who
     hath also given unto us his Holy Spirit.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>9</verse><span>But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto
     you; for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all
     Macedonia; but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more
     and more;
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>and that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and
     to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>that ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and
     that ye may have lack of nothing.

     The coming of the Lord

    <block>
     <verse>13</verse><span>But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning
     them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which
     have no hope.
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them
     also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that they who
     are alive at the coming of the Lord, shall not prevent them who
     remain unto the coming of the Lord, who are asleep.
     </span><verse>16</verse><span>For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,
     with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God; and
     the dead in Christ shall rise first;
     </span><verse>17</verse><span>then they who are alive, shall be caught up together into the clouds with
     them who remain, to meet the Lord in the air; and so shall we be
     ever with the Lord.

    </span></block>

    <chapter>5
    </chapter>

    <block>
     <verse>1</verse><span>But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need
     that I write unto you.
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so
     cometh as a thief in the night.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>For when they shall say, "Peace and safety;" then sudden
     destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with
     child; and they shall not escape.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>4</verse><span>But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should
     overtake you as a thief.
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day;
     we are not of the night, nor of darkness.
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and
     be sober.
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>For they that sleep, sleep in the night; and they that be
     drunken, are drunken in the night.
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the
     breastplate of faith and love; and for a helmet, the hope of
     salvation.
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation
     by our Lord Jesus Christ,
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live
     together with him.
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another,
     even as also ye do.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>12</verse><span>And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labor among

     </span><verse>13</verse><span>and to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake.
     And be at peace among yourselves.
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>Now we exhort you, brethren:

     <dot><span>be patient toward all men.</span></dot>

     <verse>1</verse><span>For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of
     the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the
     kings, and blessed him;
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>to whom also Abraham
     gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of
     righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, "king of
     peace;"
     </span><verse>3</verse><dunder><span>for this Melchizedek was ordained a priest after the order of the Son of God, which order was</span></dunder><span>
     without father,
     without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end
     of life. And
     </span><dunder><span>all those who are ordained unto this priesthoo</span></dunder><span>d
     are made like unto the Son of God, abiding a priest continually.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>4</verse><span>Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch
     Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office
     of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according
     to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins
     of Abraham;
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>but he whose descent is not counted
     from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the
     promises.
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>And without all contradiction the less
     is blessed of the better.
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>And here men that die
     receive tithes; but there he receiveth them, of whom it is witnessed that
     he liveth.
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>And as I may so say, Levi also, who
     receiveth tithes, paid tithes in Abraham.
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>For
     he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchizedek met him.

    <block>
     <verse>11</verse><span>If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it
     the people received the law,) what further need was there that another
     priest should rise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be called
     after the order of Aaron?
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change
     also of the law.
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of
     which no man gave attendance at the altar.
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe
     Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>And it is yet far more evident; for that after the similitude of
     Melchizedek there ariseth another priest,
     </span><verse>16</verse><span>Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the
     power of an endless life.

     candlestick, and the table, and the showbread; which is called the

     gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand
     full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication;

     proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.

     her fruit every month; and the leaves of the tree were for the healing
     of the nations.
