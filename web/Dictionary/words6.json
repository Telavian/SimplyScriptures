It represents a close articulation, formed by pressing the root of the tongue against the upper part of the mouth, with a depression of the lower jaw and opening of the teeth.  It is usually denominated a guttural, but is more properly a palatal.  Before all the vowels,it has one invariable sound, corresponding with that of c, before a, o, and u, as in keel,ken. In monosyllables, it is used after c, as in crack, check, deck, being necessary to exhibit a correct pronunciation in the derivatives, cracked, checked, decked, cracking, for without it, c, before the vowels e and i, would be sounded like s.\nFormerly, k was added to c, in certain words of Latin origin, as in musick, publick, republick.  But in modern practice, k is very properly omitted, being entirely superfluous, and the more properly, as it is never written in the derivatives, musical, publication, republican.  It is retained in traffick, as in monosyllables, on account of the pronunciation of the derivatives, trafficked, trafficking.\nK is silent before n, as in know, knife, knee.  As a numeral, K stands for 250; and with a stroke over it, for 250,000.  This character was not used by the ancient Romans, and rarely in the later ages of their empire.  In the place of k, they used c, as in clino, for Greek.  In the Teutonic dialects, this Greek letter is sometimes represented by h.  [See H.]"},{"Word":"Kaaling","Definition":"KAALING, n.

See lay.  A law is that which is laid, set or fixed, like statute, constitution, from L. statuo.]\n1.  A rule, particularly an established or permanent rule, prescribed by the supreme power of a state to its subjects, for regulating their actions, particularly their social actions.  Laws are imperative or mandatory, commanding what shall be done; prohibitory, restraining from what is to be forborn; or permissive, declaring what may be done without incurring a penalty.  The laws which enjoin the duties of piety and morality, are prescribed by God and found in the Scriptures.\nLaw is beneficence acting by rule.\n2.  Municipal law, is a rule of civil conduct prescribed by the supreme power of a state, commanding what its subjects are to do, and prohibiting what they are to forbear; a statute.\nMunicipal or civil laws are established by the decrees, edicts or ordinances of absolute princes, as emperors and kings, or by the formal acts of the legislatures of free states.  Law therefore is sometimes equivalent to decree, edict, or ordinance.\n3.  Law of nature, is a rule of conduct arising out of the natural relations of human beings established by the Creator, and existing prior to any positive precept.  Thus it is a law of nature, that one man should not injure another, and murder and fraud would be crimes, independent of any prohibition from a supreme power.\n4.

The invariable tendency or determination of any species of matter to a particular form with definite properties, and the determination of a body to certain motions, changes, and relations, which uniformly take place in the same circumstances, is called a physical law.  These tendencies or determinations, whether called laws or affections of matter, have been established by the Creator, and are, with a peculiar felicity of expression, denominated in Scripture, ordinances of heaven.\n7.  Laws of nations, the rules that regulate the mutual intercourse of nations or states.  These rules depend on natural law, or the principles of justice which spring from the social state; or they are founded on customs, compacts, treaties, leagues and agreements between independent communities.\nBy the law of nations, we are to understand that code of public instruction, which defines the rights and prescribes the duties of nations, in their intercourse with each other.\n8.  Moral law, a law which prescribes to men their religious and social duties, in other words, their duties to God and to each other.  The moral law is summarily contained in the decalogue or ten commandments, written by the finger of God on two tables of stone, and delivered to Moses on mount Sinai.  \nEx. 20.\n9.  Ecclesiastical law, a rule of action prescribed for the government of a church; otherwise called canon law.\n10.  Written law, a law or rule of action prescribed or enacted by a sovereign, and promulgated and recorded in writing; a written statute, ordinance, edict or decree.\n11.  Unwritten or common law, a rule of action which derives its authority from long usage, or established custom, which has been immemorially received and recognized by judicial tribunals.  As this law can be traced to no positive statutes, its rules or principles are to be found only in the records of courts, and in the reports of judicial decisions.\n12.  By-law, a law of a city, town or private corporation.  [See By.]\n13.  Mosaic law, the institutions of Moses, or the code of laws prescribed to the Jews, as distinguished from the gospel.\n14.

A rule of direction; a directory; as reason and natural conscience.\nThese, having not the law, as a law to themselves.  Rom. 2.\n16.  That which governs or has a tendency to rule; that which has the power of controlling.\nBut I see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.  Romans 7.\n17.  The word of God; the doctrines and precepts of God, or his revealed will.\nBut his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in his law doth he meditate day and night.  Ps. 1.\n18.

A rule or axiom of science or art; settled principle; as the laws of versification or poetry.\n21.  Law martial, or martial law, the rules ordained for the government of an army or military force.\n22.  Marine laws, rules for the regulation of navigation, and the commercial intercourse of nations.\n23.  Commercial law, law-merchant, the system of rules by which trade and commercial intercourse are regulated between merchants.\n24.  Judicial process; prosecution of right in courts of law.\nTom Touchy is a fellow famous for taking the law of every body.\nHence the phrase, to go to law, to prosecute; to seek redress in a legal tribunal.\n25.

In general, law is a rule of action prescribed for the government of rational beings or moral agents, to which rule they are bound to yield obedience, in default of which they are exposed to punishment; or law is a settled mode or course of action or operation in irrational beings and in inanimate bodies.\nCivil law, criminal law.

[L. libertas, from liber, free.]\n1.  Freedom from restraint, in a general sense, and applicable to the body, or to the will or mind.  The body is at liberty, when not confined; the will or mind is at liberty, when not checked or controlled.  A man enjoys liberty, when no physical force operates to restrain his actions or volitions.\n2.  Natural liberty, consists in the power of acting as one thinks fit, without any restraint or control, except from the laws of nature.  It is a state of exemption from the control of others, and from positive laws and the institutions of social life.  This liberty is abridged by the establishment of government.\n3.  Civil liberty, is the liberty of men in a state of society, or natural liberty, so far only abridged and restrained, as is necessary and expedient for the safety and interest of the society, state or nation.  A restraint of natural liberty, not necessary or expedient for the public, is tyranny or oppression.  civil liberty is an exemption from the arbitrary will of others, which exemption is secured by established laws, which restrain every man from injuring or controlling another.  Hence the restraints of law are essential to civil liberty.\nThe liberty of one depends not so much on the removal of all restraint from him, as on the due restraint upon the liberty of others.\nIn this sentence, the latter word liberty denotes natural liberty.\n4.  Political liberty, is sometimes used as synonymous with civil liberty.  But it more properly designates the liberty of a nation, the freedom of a nation or state from all unjust abridgment of its rights and independence by another nation.  Hence we often speak of the political liberties of Europe, or the nations of Europe.\n5.  Religious liberty, is the free right of adopting and enjoying opinions on religious subjects, and of worshiping the Supreme Being according to the dictates of conscience, without external control.\n6.  Liberty, in metaphysics, as opposed to necessity, is the power of an agent to do or forbear any particular action, according to the determination or thought of the mind, by which either is preferred to the other.\nFreedom of the will; exemption from compulsion or restraint in willing or volition.\n7.  Privilege; exemption; immunity enjoyed by prescription or by grant; with a plural.  Thus we speak of the liberties of the commercial cities of Europe.\n8.  Leave; permission granted.  The witness obtained liberty to leave the court.\n9.  A space in which one is permitted to pass without restraint, and beyond which he may not lawfully pass; with a plural; as the liberties of a prison.\n10.  Freedom of action or speech beyond the ordinary bounds of civility or decorum.  Females should repel all improper liberties.\nTo take the liberty to do or say any thing, to use freedom not specially granted.\nTo set at liberty, to deliver from confinement; to release from restraint.\nTo be at liberty, to be free from restraint.\nLiberty of the press, is freedom from any restriction on the power to publish books; the free power of publishing what one pleases, subject only to punishment for abusing the privilege, or publishing what is mischievous to the public or injurious to individuals."},{"Word":"Libidinous","Definition":"LIBID\u0027INOUS, a.

We observe its primary sense is nearly the same as that of seek.  Hence, to look for is to seek.]\n1.  To direct the eye towards an object, with the intention of seeing it.\nWhen the object is within sight, look is usually followed by on or at.  We look on or at a picture; we look on or at the moon; we cannot look on or at the unclouded sun, without pain.\nAt, after look, is not used in our version of the Scriptures.  In common usage, at or on is now used indifferently in many cases, and yet in other cases, usage has established a preference.  In general, on is used in the more solemn forms of expression.  Moses was afraid to look on God.  The Lord look on you and judge.  In these and similar phrases, the use of at would be condemned, as expressing too little solemnity.\nIn some cases, at seems to be more properly used before very distant objects; but the cases can hardly be defined.\nThe particular direction of the eye is expressed by various modifying words; as, to look down, to look up, to look back to look forward, to look from, to look round, to look out, to look under.  When the object is not in sight, look is followed by after, or for.  Hence, to look after, or look for, is equivalent to seek or search, or to expect.\n2.  To see; to have the sight or view of.\nFate sees thy life lodged in a brittle glass, and looks it through, but to it cannot pass.\n3. To direct the intellectual eye; to apply the mind or understanding; to consider; to examine. Look at the conduct of this man; view it in all its aspects. Let every man look into the state of his own heart. Let us look beyond the received notions of men on this subject.\n4.  To expect.\nHe must look to fight another battle, before he could reach Oxford.  [Little used.\n5.  To take care; to watch.\nLook that ye bind them fast.\n6.  To be directed.\nLet thine eyes look right on.  Prov. 4.\n7.  To seem; to appear; to have a particular appearance.  The patient looks better than he did.  The clouds look rainy.\nI am afraid it would look more like vanity than gratitude.\nObserve how such a practice looks in another person.\nSo we say, to look stout or big; to look peevish; to look pleasant or graceful.\n8.

To seek; to search; as, to look for lost money, or lost cattle.\nTo look into, to inspect closely; to observe narrowly; to examine; as, to look into the works of nature; to look into the conduct of another; to look into one\u0027s affairs.\nWhich things the angels desire to look into.  1Peter 1.\n1.  To look on, to regard; to esteem.\nHer friends would look on her the worse.\n2.  To consider; to view; to conceive of; to think.\nI looked on Virgil as a succinct, majestic writer.\n3.  To be a mere spectator.\nI\u0027ll be a candle-holder and look on.\nTo look over, to examine one by one; as, to look over a catalogue of books; to look over accounts.\nTo overlook, has a different sense, to pass over without seeing.\nTo look out, to be on the watch.  The seaman looks out for breakers.\n1.  To look to, or unto, to watch; to take care of.\nLook well to thy herds.  Prov. 27.\n2.

The sense is probably to be prompt, free, willing, from leaning, advancing, or drawing forward.]\n1.  In a general sense to be pleased with; to regard with affection, on account of some qualities which excite pleasing sensations or desire of gratification.  We love a friend, on account of some qualities which give us pleasure in his society.  We love a man who has done us a favor; in which case, gratitude enters into the composition of our affection.  We love our parents and our children, on account of their connection with us, and on account of many qualities which please us.  We love to retire to a cool shade in summer.  We love a warm room in winter.  we love to hear an eloquent advocate.  The christian loves his Bible.  In short, we love whatever gives us pleasure and delight, whether animal or intellectual; and if our hearts are right, we love God above all things, as the sum of all excellence and all the attributes which can communicate happiness to intelligent beings.  In other words, the christian loves God with the love of complacency in his attributes, the love of benevolence towards the interest of his kingdom, and the love of gratitude for favors received.  \nThou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind - \nThou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.  Matt. 22.\n2.  To have benevolence or good will for.  John 3.\nLOVE, n.  \n1.  An affection of the mind excited by beauty and worth of any kind, or by the qualities of an object which communicate pleasure, sensual or intellectual.  It is opposed to hatred.  Love between the sexes, is a compound affection, consisting of esteem, benevolence, and animal desire.  Love is excited by pleasing qualities of any kind, as by kindness, benevolence, charity, and by the qualities which render social intercourse agreeable.  In the latter case, love is ardent friendship, or a strong attachment springing from good will and esteem, and the pleasure derived from the company, civilities and kindness of others.\nBetween certain natural relatives, love seems to be in some cases instinctive.  Such is the love of a mother for her child, which manifests itself toward an infant, before any particular qualities in the child are unfolded.  This affection is apparently as strong in irrational animals as in human beings.\nWe speak of the love of amusements, the love of books, the love of money, and the love of whatever contributes to our pleasure or supposed profit.\nThe love of God is the first duty of man, and this springs from just views of his attributes or excellencies of character, which afford the highest delight to the sanctified heart.  Esteem and reverence constitute ingredients in this affection, and a fear of offending him is its inseparable effect.\n2.  Courtship; chiefly in the phrase, to make love, that is, to court; to woo; to solicit union in marriage.\n3.  Patriotism; the attachment one has to his native land; as the love of country.\n4.

Formerly the condition was,that if the mortgager should repay the money at the day specified, he might then re-enter on the estate granted in pledge; but the modern practice is for the mortgagee, on receiving payment, to reconvey the land to the mortgager.  Before the time specified for payment, that is, between the time of contract and the time limited for payment, the estate is conditional, and the mortgagee is called tenant in mortgage; but on failure of payment at the time limited, the estate becomes absolute in the mortgagee.  But in this case, courts of equity interpose,and if the estate is of more value than the debt, they will on application grant a reasonable time for the mortgager to redeem the estate.

The word matter is evidently from the Ar. madda, to secrete, eject or discharge a purulent substance; and I think cannot have any direct connection with mud.

But other parts of the body, as the heart, the urinary bladder, the stomach, \u0026c. are of a muscular texture, and susceptible of contraction and dilatation, but are not subject to the will, and are therefore called involuntary muscles. The red color of the muscles is owing to the blood vessels which they contain.  The ends of the muscles are fastened to the bones which they move, and when they act in opposition to each other, they are called antagonists.\nMuscles are divided into the head, belly and tail.  The head is the part fixed on the immovable joint called its origin, and is usually tendinous; the belly is the middle fleshy part,which consists of the true muscular fibers; the tail is the tendinous portion inserted into the part to be moved, called the insertion; but in the tendon, the fibers are more compact than in the belly of the muscle,and do not admit the red globules.\n2.

Ordinal numbers are those which express order; as first, second, third, fourth, \u0026c.\nDeterminate number, is that referred to a given unit, as a ternary or three; an indeterminate number, is referred to unity in general, and called quantity.\nHomogeneal numbers, are those referred to the same units; those referred to different units are termed heterogeneal.\nWhole numbers, are called integers.\nA rational number, is one commensurable with unity.  A number incommensurable with unity, is termed irrational or surd.\nA prime or primitive number, is divisible only by unity; as three, five, seven, \u0026c.\nA perfect number, is that whose aliquot parts added together, make the whole number, as 28, whose aliquot parts, 14. 7. 4. 2. 1. make the number 28.\nAn imperfect number, is that whose aliquot parts added together, make more or less than the number.  This is abundant or defedtive; abundant, as 12, whose aliquot parts, 6. 4. 3. 2. 1. make 16; or defective, as 16 whose aliquot parts, 8. 4. 2. 1. make 15 only.\nA square number, is the product of a number multiplied by itself; as, 16 is the square number of four.\nA cubic number, is the product of a square number by its root; as, 27 is the product of the square number 9 by its root 3.\nGolden number, the cycle of the moon, or revolution of 19 years, in which time the conjunctions, oppositions and other aspects of the moon are nearly the same as they were on the same days of the month 19 years before.\nNUM\u0027BER, v.t. \n1. To count; to reckon; to ascertain the units of any sum, collection or multitude.\nIf a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.  Genesis 8.\n2.

The sound of oo is shortened in words ending in a close articulation, as in book and foot.\nThe long sound of O, is usually denoted by e, at the end of a word or syllable, as in bone, lonely; or by a servile a, as in moan, foal.  It is generally long before ll, as in roll; but it is short in doll, loll, and in words of more syllables than one, as in folly, volley.\nAs a numeral, O was sometimes used by the ancients for 11, and with a dash over it for 11,000.\nAmong the ancients, O was a mark of tripe time, from the notion that the ternary or number 3, is the most perfect of numbers, and properly expressed by a circle, the most perfect figure.\nO is often used as an exclamation, expressing a wish.\nO, were he present.\nIt sometimes expresses surprise.
