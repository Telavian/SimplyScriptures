A well known substance manufactured chiefly from the sugar cane, arundo saccharifera; but in the United States, great quantities of this article are made from the sugar maple; and in France, a few years since, it was extensively manufactured from the beet.  The saccharine liquor is concentrated by boiling, which expels the water; lime is added to neutralize the acid that is usually present; the gresser impurities rise to the surface, and are separated in the form of scum; and finally as the liquor cools,the sugar separates from the melasses in grains.  The sirup or melasses is drained off, leaving the sugar in the state known in commerce by the name of raw or muscovado sugar.  This is farther purified by means of clay, or more extensively by bullocks\u0027 blood, which forming a coagulum, envelops the impurities.  Thus clarified, it takes the names of lump, loaf, refined, \u0026c. according to the different degrees of purification.  Sugar is a proximate element of the vegetable kingdom, and is found in most ripe fruits and many farinaceous roots.  By fermentation, sugar is converted into alcohol, and hence forms the basis of those substances which are used for making intoxicating liquors, as melasses, grapes, apples, malt, \u0026c.\nThe ultimate elements of sugar are oxygen, carbon and hydrogen.

It represents a close joining of the end of the tongue to the root of the upper teeth, as may be perceived by the syllables at, et, ot, ut, in attempting to pronounce which, the voice is completely intercepted.  It is therefore numbered among the mutes, or close articulations, and it differs from d chiefly in its closeness; for in pronouncing ad, ed, we perceive the voice is not so suddenly and entirely intercepted, as in pronouncing at and et.  T by itself has one sound only, as in take, turn, bat, bolt, smite, bitter.  So we are accustomed to speak; but in reality, t can be hardly said to have any sound at all. Its use, like that of all mute articulations, is to modify the manner of uttering the vocal sound which precedes or follows it.\nWhen t is followed by h, as in think and that, the combination really forms a distinct sound for which we have no single character.  This combination has two sounds in English; aspirated, as in think, and vocal, as in that.\nThe letters ti, before a vowel, and unaccented, usually pass into the sound of sh, as in nation, motion, partial substantiate; which are pronounced nashon, moshon, parshal, substanshate.  In the case, t loses entirely its proper sound or use, and being blended with the subsequent letter, a new sound results from the combination, which is in fact a simple sound.  In a few words, the combination ti has the sound of the English ch, as in Christian, mixtion, question.\nT, as an abbreviation, stands for theologia; as, S.T.D. sanctoe theologioe doctor, doctor of divinity. In ancient monuments and writings, T is an abbreviature, which stands for Titus, Titius or Tullius.  As a numeral, T, among the Latins, stood for 160, and with a dash over the top, T, for 160,000.\nIn music, T is the initial of tenor, vocal and instrumental; of tacet, for silence, as adagio tacet, when a person is to rest during the whole movement.  In concertos and symphonies, it is the initial of tutti, the whole band, after a solo.

That is a word used as a definitive adjective, pointing to a certain person or thing before mentioned, or supposed to be understood.  \u0027Here is that book we have been seeking this hour.\u0027  \u0027Here goes that man we were talking of.\u0027\n It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than for that city. Matt.10.\n2.  That is used definitively, to designate a specific thing or person emphatically.\n The woman was made whole from that hour. Matt.9.\nIn these cases, that is an adjective.  In the two first examples,the may be substituted for it.  \u0027Here is the book we have been seeking.\u0027  \u0027Here goes the man we were talking of.\u0027  But in other cases, the cannot supply its place, and that may be considered as more emphatically definite than the.\n3.  That is used as the representative of a noun, either a person or a thing.  In this use, it is often a pronoun and a relative. When it refers to persons, it is equivalent to who, and when it refers to a thing, it is equivalent to which.  In this use, it represents either the singular number or the plural.\n He that reproveth a scorner, getteth to himself shame. Prov.9.\n They that hate me without a cause, are more than the hairs of my head. Ps.63.\n A judgment that is equal and impartial, must incline to the greater probabilities.\n They shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend. Matt.13.\n4.  That is also the representative of a sentence or part of a sentence, and often of a series of sentences.  In this case, that is not strictly a pronoun, a word standing for a noun; but is, so to speak, a pro-sentence, the substitute for a sentence, to save the repetition of it.\n And when Moses heard that, he was content. Lev.10.\n That here stands for the whole of what Aaron had said, or the whole of the preceding verse.\n I will know your business,that I will.\n Ye defraud, and that your brethren. 1 Cor.6.\nThat sometimes in this use, precedes the sentence or clause to which it refers.\nThat be far from thee, to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked. Gen.18.\nThat here represents the clause in italics.\n5.  That sometimes is the substitute for an adjective. You allege that the man is innocent; that he is not.\n6.  That, in the following use, has been called a conjunction.  \u0027I heard that the Greeks had defeated the Turks.\u0027  But in this case, that has the same character as in No.4.  It is the representative of the part of the sentence which follows, as may be seen by inverting the order of the clauses.  \u0027The Greeks had defeated the Turks; I heard that.\u0027  \u0027It is not that I love you less.\u0027  That here refers to the latter clause of the sentence, as a kind of demonstrative.\n7.  That was formerly used for that which, like what.\n We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen. John 3.  [This use is no longer held legitimate.]\n8.  That is used in opposition to this, or by way of distinction.\n9.  When this and that refer to foregoing words, this, like the Latin hie, and French ceci, refers to the latter, and that to the former.  It is the same with these and those.\n Self-love and reason to one end aspire,\n Pain their aversion, pleasure their desire,\n But greedy that, its object would devour,\n This taste the honey, and not wound the flow\u0027r.\n    10. That sometimes introduces an explanation of something going before. \u0027Religion consists in living up to those principles; that is, in acting in conformity to them.\u0027  Here that refers to the whole first clause of the sentence.\n    11. \u0027Things are preached, not in that they are taught, but in that they are published.\u0027  Here that refers to the words which follow it.\nSo when that begins a sentence, \u0027That we may fully understand the subject, let us consider the following propositions.\u0027  That denotes purpose, or rather introduces the clause expressing purposes, as will appear by restoring the sentence to its natural order.  \u0027Let us consider the following propositions, that, [for the purpose expressed in the following clause,] we may fully understand the subject.\u0027  \u0027Attend that you may receive instruction;\u0027 that referring to the last member.\nIn that, a phrase denoting consequence, cause or reason; that referring to the following sentence."},{"Word":"Thatch","Definition":"THATCH, n.

The sun is the source of light and heat.\n This he calls the preaching of the cross.\n2.

It is however chiefly used to denote the barter or purchase and sale of goods, wares and merchandise, either by wholesale or retail.  Trade is either foreign, or domestic or inland.  Foreign trade consists in the exportation and importation of goods, or the exchange of the commodities of different countries.  Domestic or home trade is the exchange or buying and selling of goods within a country.  Trade is also by the wholesale, that is, by the package or in large quantities, or it is by retail, or in small parcels.\nThe carrying trade is that of transporting commodities from one country to another by water.\n2.

The country shopkeepers trade with London merchants.  Our banks are permitted to trade in bills of exchange.\n1.  To buy and sell or exchange property, in a single instance.
