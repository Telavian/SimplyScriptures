It is uttered with a guttural extrusion of the breath, and in some words, particularly at the end or after a labial and a dental letter, with a sort of quivering motion or slight jar of the tongue.

It is the same in the Welsh language.  But as the letter is not aspirated in English, h is entirely superfluous; rhapsody, rheum, rhetoric, being pronounced rapsody, reum, retoric.\nAs an abbreviation, R. in English, stands for rex, king, as George R.\nAs a numeral, R, in Roman authors, stands for 80, and with a dash over it, for 80,000.

It therefore comprehends theology, as a system of doctrines or principles, as well as practical piety; for the practice of moral duties without a belief in a divine lawgiver, and without reference to his will or commands, is not religion.\n2.  Religion, as distinct from theology, is godliness or real piety in practice, consisting in the performance of all known duties to God and our fellow men, in obedience to divine command, or from love to God and his law.  James 1.\n3.  Religion, as distinct from virtue, or morality, consists in the performance of the duties we owe directly to God, from a principle of obedience to his will.

Any system of faith and worship.

Conformity to human laws, or to other human standard of truth, propriety or justice.  When laws are definite, right and wrong are easily ascertained and understood.

Just claim by courtesy, customs, or the principles of civility and decorum.  Every man has a right to civil treatment.  The magistrate has a right to respect.\n7.

Rights are natural, civil, political, religious, personal, and public.\n11.  Authority; legal power.  We have no right to disturb others in the enjoyment of their religious opinions.\n12.

It is found native in the earth, or it is produced by evaporation and crystallization from water impregnated with saline particles.\n2.  In chimistry, a body compounded of an acid united to some base, which may be either an alkali, an earth, or a metallic oxyd.  Accordingly, salts are alkaline, earthy, or metallic.  Many compounds of this kind, of which common salt, (muriate of soda,) is the most distinguished, exist in nature; but most of these, together with many others not known in nature, have been formed by the artificial combination of their elements.  Their entire number exceeds 2000.  When the acid and base mutually saturate each other, so that the individual properties of each are lost, the compound is a neutral salt; when the acid predominates, it is a super salt; and when the base predominates, it is a sub salt.

It is now treated as a mere auxiliary to other verbs, serving to form some of the tenses. In the present tense, shall, before a verb in the infinitive, forms the future tense; but its force and effect are different with different persons or personal pronouns. Thus in the first person, shall simply foretells or declares what will take place; as, I or we shall ride to town on Monday. This declaration simply informs another of a fact that is to take place. The sense of shall here is changed from an expression of need or duty, to that of previous statement or information, grounded on intention or resolution. When uttered with emphasis, \u0027I shall go,\u0027 it expresses firm determination, but not a promise.\n           2. In the second and third persons, shall implies a promise, command or determination. \u0027You shall receive your wages,\u0027 \u0027he shall receive his wages,\u0027 imply that you or he ought to receive them; but usage gives these phrases the force of a promise in the person uttering them.\n     When shall is uttered with emphasis in such phrases, it expresses determination in the speaker, and implies an authority to enforce the act. \u0027Do you refuse to go? Does he refuse to go? But you or he shall go.\u0027\n           3. Shall I go, shall he go, interrogatively, asks, for permission or direction. But shall you go, asks for information of another\u0027s intention.\n           4. But after another verb, shall, in the third person, simply foretells. He says that he shall leave town to-morrow. So also in the second person; you say that you shall ride to-morrow.\n           5. After if, and some verbs which expresscondition or supposition, shall, in all the persons, simply foretells; as,\nIf  I shall say, or we shall say,  \n    Thou shalt say, ye or you shall say,"},{"Word":"Shalloon","Definition":"SHALLOON\u0027,  n.

The English shilling, or shilling sterling, is equivilent to nearly 22 cents, 22 hundredths, money of the United States. Our ancestors introduced the name with the coin into this country, but by depreciation the value of the shilling shrunk in New England and Virginia one fourth, or to a fraction less than 17 cents, in New York to 12 1/2 cents, in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland to about 11 cents.\n     This denomination of money still subsists in the United States, although there is no coin of that value current, except the Spanish coin of 12 1/2/ cents, which is a shilling in the money in the state of New York. Since the adoption of the present coins of the United States, eagles, dollars, cents, \u0026c. the use of the shilling is continued only by habit."},{"Word":"Shilly-shally","Definition":"SHILLY-SHALLY,  n.

This native depravity or alienation of affections from God and his law, is supposed to be what the apostle calls the carnal mind or mindedness, which is enmity against God, and is therefore denominated sin or sinfulness.
