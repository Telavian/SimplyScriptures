Thus we say, the father of a son, as well as the son of a father.  In both senses, other languages also use the same word, as in the French de, de la, and Italian di, dell.

A man raises his hand by his own power, or by power moves another body.  The exertion of power proceeds from the will, and in strictness, no being destitute of will or intelligence, can exert power.

We have power to speak when we are silent.\nPower has been distinguished also into active and passive,the power of doing or moving, and the power of receiving impressions or of suffering.  In strictness, passive power is an absurdity in terms.

In a general sense, a declaration, written or verbal, made by one person to another, which binds the person who makes it, either in honor, conscience or law, to do or forbear a certain act specified; a declaration which gives to the person to whom it is made, a right to expect or to claim the performance or forbearance of the act.  The promise of a visit to my neighbor, gives him a right to expect it, and I am bound in honor and civility to perform the promise.  Of such a promise human laws have no cognizance; but the fulfillment of it is one of the minor moralities, which civility, kindness and strict integrity require to be observed.\n2.  In law, a declaration, verbal or written, made by one person to another for a good or valuable consideration, in the nature of a covenant, by which the promiser binds himself, and as the case may be, his legal representatives, to do or forbear some act; and gives to the promisee a legal right to demand and enforce a fulfillment.\n3.  A binding declaration of something to be done or given for another\u0027s benefit; as the promise of a grant of land.  A promise may be absolute or conditional; lawful or unlawful; express or implied. An absolute promise must be fulfilled at all events.  The obligation to fulfill a conditional promise depends on the performance of the condition. An unlawful promise is not binding, because it is void; for it is incompatible with a prior paramount obligation of obedience to the laws.  An express promise, is one expressed in words or writing.  An implied promise, is one which reason and justice dictate.  If I hire a man to perform a day\u0027s labor, without any declaration that I will pay him, the law presumes a promise on my part that I will give him a reasonable reward, and will enforce much implied promise.\n4.  Hopes; expectation, or that which affords expectation of future distinction; as a youth of great promise.\n My native country was full of youthful promise.\n5.  That which is promised; fulfillment or grant of what is promised.\n He commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father. Acts.1.\n6.  In Scripture,the promise of God is the declaration or assurance which God has given in his word of bestowing blessings on his people.  Such assurance resting on the perfect justice,power, benevolence and immutable veracity of God, cannot fail of performance.\n The Lord is not slack concerning his promises. 2 Pet.3.\nPROM\u0027ISE, v.t.  To make a declaration to another, which binds the promiser in honor, conscience or law, to do or forbear some act; as, to promise a visit to a friend; to promise a cessation of hostilities; to promise the payment of money.\n1.  To afford reason to expect; as, the year promises a good harvest.\n2.  To make declaration or give assurance of some benefit to be conferred; to pledge or engage to bestow.\n The proprietors promised large tracts of land.\nPROM\u0027ISE, v.i.  To assure one by a promise or binding declaration.  The man promises fair; let us forgive him.\n1.  To afford hopes or expectations; to give ground to expect good.

See Portion.]\n1.  The comparative relation of any one thing to another.  Let a man\u0027s exertions be in proportion to his strength.\n2.  The identity or similitude of two ratios.  Proportion differs from ratio.  Ratio is the relation which determines the quantity of one thing from the quantity of another, without the intervention of a third.  Thus the ratio of 5 and 10 is 2; the ratio of 8 and 16 is 2.  Proportion is the sameness or likeness of two such relations. Thus 5 is to 10, as 8 to 16, or A is to B, as C is to D; that is, 5 bears the same relation to 10, as 8 does to 16.  Hence we say, such numbers are in proportion.\nProportion, in mathematics, an equality or ratios.\nThe term proportion is sometimes improperly used for ratio.  The ratio between two quantities, is expressed by the quotient of one divided by the other; thus, the ratio of 10 to 5 is 2, and the ratio of 16 to 8 is 2.  These two equal ratios constitute a proportion, which is expressed by saying, 10 is to 5 as 16 is to 8; or more concisely, 10: 5:: 16: 8.  [See Ratio.]\n3.  In arithmetic, a rule by which, when three numbers are given, a fourth number is found, which bears the same relation to the third as the second does to the first; or a fourth number is found, bearing the same relation to the second as the first does to the third.  The former is called direct, and the latter, inverse proportion.\n4.  Symmetry; suitable adaptation of one part or thing to another; as the proportion of one limb to another in the human body; the proportion of the length and breadth of a room to its highth.\n Harmony, with every grace,\n Place in the fair proportions of her face.\n5.  Equal or just share; as, to ascertain the proportion of profit to which each partner in a company is entitled.\n6.  Form; size.  [Little used.]\n7.  The relation between unequal things of the same kind, by which their several parts correspond to each other with an equal augmentation and diminution, as in reducing and enlarging figures.\n[This more properly belongs to ratio.]\nHarmonical or musical proportion, is when, of three numbers,the first is to the third as the difference of the first and second to the difference of the second and third. Thus 2.3.6. are in harmonical proportion; for 2 is to 6 as 1 to 3.  So also four numbers are harmonical, when the first is to the fourth, as the difference of the first and second is to the difference of the third and fourth. Thus, 24.16.12.9. are harmonical, for 24 : 9 :: 8 : 3.\nArithmetical and geometrical proportion.  [See Progression, No.4.]\nReciprocal proportion, an equality between a direct and a reciprocal ratio. Thus, 4 : 2 :: 1/3 : 1/6.  [See Reciprocals, and Reciprocal ratio.]\nPROPORTION, v.t.

It is supposed to be an articulation more deeply guttural than that of K; indeed it might have been pronounced as we pronounce qu; for we observe that in the Latin language, from which the moderns have borrowed the letter, it is always followed by u, as it is in English.  This letter is not in the Greek alphabet.  This letter is superfluous; for ku or koo, in English, have precisely the same sounds as qu.  It is alleged that in expressing q, the cheeks are contracted, and the lips put into a canular form, for the passage of the breath; circumstances which distinguish it from k.  This appears to be a mistake.  This position of the organs is entirely owing to the following letter u; and kuestion and question are pronounced precisely alike, and with the same configuration of the organs.  It appears then that q is precisely k, with this difference in use, that q is always followed by u in English, and k is not.  Q never ends an English word.\nAs a numeral, Q stands for 500, and with a dash above the Q, for 500,000.\nUsed as an abbreviation, Q stands for quantity, or quantum; as among physicians, q. pl. quantum placet, as much as you please; q s quantum sufficit, as much as is required, or as is sufficient.\nAmong mathematicians, Q.E.D. stands for quod erat demonstrandum, which was to be demonstrated; Q.E.F. quod erat faciendum, which was to be done.\nIn English, Q is an abbreviation for question."},{"Word":"Quab","Definition":"QUAB, n.  \nA fish of Russian rivers, which delights in clear water."},{"Word":"Quachilto","Definition":"QUACHIL\u0027TO, n.
