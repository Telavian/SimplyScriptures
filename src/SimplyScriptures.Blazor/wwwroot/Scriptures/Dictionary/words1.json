[{"Word":"A","Definition":"A is the first letter of the Alphabet in most of the known languages of the earth; in the Ethiopic, however it is the thirteenth, and in the Runic the tenth. It is naturally the first letter, because it represents the first vocal sound naturally formed by the human organs; being the sound uttered with a mere opening of the mouth without constraint, and without any effort to alter the natural position or configuration of the lips. The A has been proven to be the first natural vocal sound, and entitled to the first place in alphabets. \nA has in English, three sounds; the long or slender, as in place, fate; the broad, as in wall, fall, which is shortened in salt, what; and the open, as in father, glass, which is shortened in rather, fancy. Its primitive sound was probably aw.  A is also an abbreviation used before words beginning with an articulation; as a table, instead of an table, or one table.  This is a modern change.\nThis letter serves as a prefix to many English words, as in asleep; awake; afoot; aground; agoing.  In some cases, this is a contraction of Teutonic ge, as in asleep, aware, from the Saxon geslapan, to sleep, to beware.  Sometimes it is a corruption of the Saxon on, as again from ongean , awake from onwacian to watch or wake.  Before participles, it may be a contraction of the Celtic ag, the sign of the participle of the present tense; as, ag-radh, saying; a saying, a going. Or this may be a contraction of on, or what is equally probable, it may have proceeded from a mere accidental sound produced by negligent utterance.  In some words, a may be a contraction of at, of, in, to, or an.  In some words of Greek original, a is privative, giving to them a negative sense, as in anonymous.\nAmong the ancients, A was a numeral denoting 500, and with a dash A 5000. In the Julian Calendar, A is the first of the seven dominical letters.\nAmong logicians, A, as an abbreviation, stands for a universal affirmative proposition. A asserts; E denies. Thus in barbara, a thrice repeated denotes so many of the propositions to be universal.\nThe Romans used A to signify a negative or dissent in giving their votes; A standing for antiquo, I oppose or object to the proposed law. Opposed to this letter were U R, uti rogas, be it as you desire - the words used to express assent to a proposition. These letters were marked on wooden ballots, and each voter had an affirmative and a negative put into his hands, one of which at pleasure he gave as his vote, - In criminal trials, A stood for absolvo, I acquit, C for condemno, I condemn; and N L for non liquet, it is not evident; and the judges voted by ballots this marked.  In inscriptions, A stands for Augustus; or for ager, aiunt, , aurum, argentum, \u0026c.\nA is also used for anno, or ante; as in Anno Domini, the year of our Lord; anno mundi, the year of the world; ante meridiem, before noon, and for arts, in artium magister, master of arts. \nIn algebra, a and first letters of the alphabet represent known quantities - the last letters are sometimes used to represent unknown quantities.\nmusic, A is the nominal of the sixth note in the natural diatonic scale - called by Guido la. It is also the name of one of the two natural moods; and it is the open note of the 2d string of the violin, by which the other strings are tuned and regulated.\nIn pharmacy, a or aa, abbreviations of the Greek ana, signify of each separately, or that the things mentioned should be taken in quantities of the same weight or measure.\nIn chimistry, A A A stand for amalgama, or amalgamation.\nIn commerce, A stands for accepted, as in case of a bill of exchange.  Merchants also number their books by the letters - A,B,C, instead of figures.  Public officers number their exhibits in the same manner; as the document A, or B.\nAlpha and Omega, the first and last letters of the Greek Alphabet, are used in Scripture for the beginning and end - representative of Christ.\nIn mathematics, letters are used as representatives of numbers, lines, angles and quantities.  In arguments, letters are substituted for persons, in cases supposed, or stated for illustration, as A contracts with B to deliver property to D. - In the English phraseology \u0022a landlord as a hundred a year,\u0022 \u0022 the sum amounted to ten dollars a man,\u0022 a is merely the adjective one, and this mode of expression is idiomatic; a hundred in a year; ten dollars to a man."},{"Word":"A-posteriori","Definition":"A-POSTERIORI, [L. posterior, after.]\nArguments a posteriori, are drawn from effect, consequences or facts; in opposition to reasoning a priori, or from causes previously known."},{"Word":"Aam","Definition":"AAM, n.

The pronunciation of the first vowel ought to accord with that is antiquity, anger, anchor, \u0026c.  [Lt. ante, antiquus.] We usually apply ancient and old to things subject to gradual decay. We say, an old man, an ancient record; but never the old sun, old stars, an old river or mountain.\n1.  Old; that happened or existed in former times, usually at a great distance of time; as, ancient authors, ancient days.  Old, says Johnson, relates to the duration of the thing itself, as an old coat; and ancient to time in general, as an ancient dress.  But this distinction is not always observed.  We say, in old times, as well as ancient times; old customs, \u0026c.  In general, however, ancient is opposed to modern, and old to new, fresh or recent.  When we speak of a thing that existed formerly, which as ceased to exist, we commonly use ancient, as ancient republics\u0027 ancient heroes, and not old republics, old heroes.  But when the thing which began or existed in former times, is still in existence, we use either ancient or old; as, ancient statues or paintings, or old statues or paintings; ancient authors, or old authors, meaning books.

Ancient is also used for a flag or streamer, in a ship of war; and for an ensign or the bearer of a flag, as in Shakespeare.  Cowel supposed the word, when used for a flag, to be a corruption of end-sheet, a flag at the stern.

Natural aversion; instinctive contrariety or opposition in feeling; an aversion felt at the presence, real or ideal, of a particular object.  This word literally denotes a natural aversion, which may be of different degrees, and in some cases may excite terror or horror at the presence of an object.  Such is the aversion of animals for their natural enemies, as the antipathy of a mouse to a cat, or a weasel.  Sometimes persons have an insuperable constitutional antipathy to certain kinds of food.\nThe word is applied also to aversion contracted by experience or habit; as when a person has suffered an injury from some food, or from an animal, which before was not an object of hatred; or when a particular kind of food or medicine is taken into a sickly stomach, and which nauseates it; the effect is antipathy, which is often of long continuance.\n2.  In ethics, antipathy is hatred, aversion or repugnancy; hatred to persons; aversion to persons or things; repugnancy to actions.  Of these hatred is most voluntary.  Aversion, and antipathy, in its true sense, depend more on the constitution; repugnancy may depend on reason or education.\nInveterate antipathies against particular nations, and passionate attachments to others, are to be avoided.\n3.

This principle, introduced into the commerce of Europe, from the Rhodian laws, and recognized by the regulations of Wisby, is now an established rule in the maritime laws of Europe; for it is most reasonable, that when one man\u0027s property is sacrificed to save a ship, all persons whose property is saved, or in like hazard, should bear their proportion of the loss.\n2.  From the practice of contributing to bear losses, in proportion to each man\u0027s property, this word has obtained the present popular sense, which is, that of a mean proportion, medial sum or quantity, made out of unequal sums or quantities.  Thus, if A loses 5 dollars, B 9 and C 16, the sum is 30, and the average, 10.\n3.

As balance signifies equal weight, or equality, it is by custom used for the weight or sum necessary to make two unequal weights or sums equal; that which is necessary to bring them to a balance or equipoise.  Hence, in accounts, balance is the difference of two sums; as upon an adjustment of accounts, a balance was found against A, in favor of B.  Hence, to pay a balance, is to pay the difference and make the two accounts equal.\n5.  Balance of trade is an equal exportation of domestic productions, and importation of foreign. But, usually, the term is applied to the difference between the amount or value of the commodities exported and imported.

To regulate different powers, so as to keep them in a state of just proportion; as, to balance Europe, or the powers of Europe.\n4.

Originally, the barons, being the feudatories of princes, were the proprietors of land held by honorable service.  Hence, in ancient records, the word barons comprehends all the nobility.  All such in England had, in early times, a right to sit in parliament.  As a baron was the proprietor of a manor, and each manor had its court-baron; hence the barons claimed, and to this day enjoy, the right of judging in the last resort; a right pertaining to the house of lords, or peers, as the representatives of the ancient barons, land-holders, manor-holders.\n Anciently, barons were greater, or such as held their lands of the king in capite; or lesser, such as held their lands of the greater barons by military service in capite.\n The title of baron is no longer attached to the possession of a manor, but given by the king\u0027s letters patent, or writ of summons to parliament; that is, the dignity is personal, and not territorial.\n The radical word,vir,fir,a man, is Celtic, as well as Teutonic; but the word baron was not known in the British isles, till introduced from the continent under the Norman princes.\n2.  Baron is a title of certain officers, as barons of the exchequer, who are the four judges who try cases between the king and his subjects, relating to the revenue.

In the face, the regularity and symmetry of the features, the color of the skin, the expression of the eye, are among the principal properties which constitute beauty.  But as it is hardly possible to define all the properties which constitute beauty, we may observe in general, that beauty consists in whatever pleases the eye of the beholder, whether in the human body, in a tree, in a landscape, or in any other object.\n Beauty is intrinsic, and perceived by the eye at first view, or relative, to perceive which the aid of the understanding and reflection is requisite.  Thus, the beauty of a machine is not perceived, till we understand its uses, and adaptation to its purpose. This is called the beauty of utility. By any easy transition, the word beauty is used to express what is pleasing to the other senses, or to the understanding.

[See Apis.]  The species are numerous, of which the honey-bee is the most interesting to man.  It has been cultivated from the earliest periods, for its wax and honey.  It lives in swarms or societies, of from 10,000 to 50,000 individuals.  These swarms contain three classes of bees, the females or queen bees, the males or drones, and the neuters or working bees.  Of the former, there is only one in each hive or swarm, whose sole office is to propagate the species.  It is much larger than the other bees.  The drones serve merely for impregnating the queen, after which they are destroyed by the neuters.  These last are the laborers of the hive.  They collect the honey, form the cells, and feed the other bees and the young.  They are furnished with a proboscis by which they suck the honey from flowers, and a mouth by which they swallow it, and then convey it to the hive in their stomachs, where they disgorge it into the cells.  The pollen of flowers settles on the hairs with which their body is covered, whence it is collected into pellets, by a brush on their second pair of legs,and deposited in a hollow in the third pair.  It is called bee bread, and is the food of the larvae or young.  The adult bees feed on honey.  The wax was supposed to be formed from pollen by a digestive process, but it is now ascertained that it is formed from the honey by a similar process. The females and neuters have a barbed sting, attached to a bag of poison, which flows into the wound inflicted by the sting.  When a hive is overstocked, a new colony is sent out under the direction of a queen bee.  This is called swarming."},{"Word":"Bee-bread","Definition":"BEE\u0027-BREAD, n.

In the Greek, Latin, and some Protestant churches, a prelate, or person consecrated for the spiritual government and direction of a diocese.  In Great Britain, bishops are nominated by the king, who, upon request of the dean and chapter, for leave to elect a bishop, sends a conge d\u0027elire, or license to elect, with a letter missive, nominating the person whom he would have chosen.  The election, by the chapter, must be made within twelve days, or the king has a right to appoint whom he pleases.  Bishops are consecrated by an archbishop, with two assistant bishops.  A bishop must be thirty years of age; and all bishops, except the bishop of Man, are peers of the realm.\n  By the canons of the Protestant Episcopal church in the United States, no diocese or state shall proceed to the election of a bishop, unless there are at least six officiating presbyters residing therein, who shall be qualified, according to the canons, to vote for a bishop; a majority of whom  at least must concur in the election.  But the conventions of two or more dioceses, or states, having together nine or more such presbyters,may join in the election of a bishop.  A convention is composed of the clergy, and a lay delegation, consisting of one or more members from each parish.  In every state, the bishop is to be chosen according to such rules as the convention of that state shall ordain.  The mode of election, in most or all of the states,is by a concurrent vote of the clergy and laity, in convention, each body voting separately.  Before a bishop can be consecrated, he must receive a testimonial of approbation from the General Convention of the church; or if that is not in session, from a majority of the standing committee in the several dioceses.
