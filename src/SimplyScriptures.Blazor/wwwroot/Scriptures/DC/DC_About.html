            This edition of Doctrine And Covenants
            increases readability by modernizing the page
            layout. The text is formatted into standard paragraphs and white space and other modern
            tools (section headers, bullet lists, etc.) are used to help with readability. The verse and
            chapter numbering of the 1981 edition have been maintained to locate specific verses, but
            those references are visually subdued so as to not distract from the message.

            Words that are part of the scriptural record appear in serif font. Anything not part of that
            record (dates and locations, verse numbers, section numbers, and section headers) appears in this sans-serif font. Anything in a sans-serif font is an addition of men and can be treated
            accordingly.

            This edition captures some of the various changes that have been made to these works over
            time. Words that were changed between the 1833 Book Of Commandments
            and 1835 Doctrine And Covenants
            are indicated by an
            </span><under><span>underline</span></under><span>
            in the main text and the previous text is shown in the margin and denoted by
            </span><bcchar></bcchar><span>. Words that were added in the 1835
            Doctrine And Covenants
            to sections already printed in the 1833
            Book Of Commandments
            are denoted by
            </span><dunder><span>dotted underline</span></dunder><span>. Changes from the original manuscripts
            are denoted by a
            </span><ddunder><span>dashed underline</span></ddunder><span>
            with the original text in margin notes denoted by

            Section headers in Doctrine And Covenants
            contain reference information as shown

            Other non-canonized records have been added to help with historical context. These appear
            in chronological position among the sections of
            Doctrine And Covenants. They have a
            similar header, including source information, but lack a section number. Those that aren’t
            found in History Of The Church
            are designated by JSP and can be found at the Joseph
            Smith Papers project (</span><a href="https://www.josephsmithpapers.org"><span>https://www.josephsmithpapers.org</span></a><span>).
