            <verse>1</verse><span>The words of God, which he spake unto Moses at a time when Moses was caught up into an
            exceedingly high mountain,
            </span><verse>2</verse><span>and he saw God face to face, and he talked with him, and the glory of
            God was upon Moses; therefore Moses could endure his presence.

        <verse>3</verse><span>And God spake unto Moses, saying:

            <block><span>
                Behold, I am the Lord God Almighty, and Endless is my name; for I am without
                beginning of days or end of years; and is not this endless?
            </span></block>

            <block>
                <verse>4</verse><span>And, behold, thou art my son; wherefore look, and I will show thee the
                workmanship of mine hands; but not all, for my works are without end, and
                also my words, for they never cease.
                </span><verse>5</verse><span>Wherefore, no man can behold all my works, except he behold all my glory;
                and no man can behold all my glory, and afterwards remain in the flesh
                on the earth.
            </span></block>

            <block>
                <verse>6</verse><span>And I have a work for thee, Moses, my son; and thou art in the similitude
                of mine Only Begotten; and mine Only Begotten is and shall be the Savior,
                for he is full of
                grace and truth; but there is no God beside me, and all things are present
                with me, for I know them all.

            <block>
                <verse>7</verse><span>And now, behold, this one thing I show unto thee, Moses, my son, for thou
                art in the world, and now I show it unto thee.

        <verse>8</verse><span>And it came to pass that Moses looked, and beheld the world upon which
        he was created; and Moses beheld the world and the ends thereof, and all
        the children of men which are, and which were created; of the same he greatly
        marveled and wondered.

        MOSES IS TEMPTED
    </span></blockheading>
    <block>
        <verse>9</verse><span>And the presence of God withdrew from Moses, that his glory was not upon
        Moses; and Moses was left unto himself. And as he was left unto himself,
        he fell unto the earth.
        </span><verse>10</verse><span>And it came to pass that it was for the space of many hours before Moses
        did again receive his natural strength like unto man; and he said unto
        himself:
        </span><quote><span>
            Now, for this cause I know that man is nothing, which thing I never had
            supposed.
            </span><verse>11</verse><span>But now mine own eyes have beheld God; but not my natural, but my spiritual
            eyes, for my natural eyes could not have beheld; for I should have withered
            and died in his presence; but his glory was upon me; and I beheld his face,
            for I was transfigured before him.

        First attempt

    <block>
        <verse>12</verse><span>And it came to pass that when Moses had said these words, behold, Satan
        came tempting him, saying, “Moses, son of man, worship me.”
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>13</verse><span>And it came to pass that Moses looked upon Satan and said:
        </span><quote>
            <block><span>
                Who art thou? For behold, I am a son of God, in the similitude of his
                Only Begotten; and where is thy glory, that I should worship thee?
                </span><verse>14</verse><span>For behold, I could not look
                upon God, except his glory should come upon me, and I were transfigured
                before him. But I can look upon thee in the natural man. Is it not so,
                surely?
                </span><verse>15</verse><span>Blessed be the name of my God, for his Spirit hath not altogether withdrawn
                from me, or else where
                is thy glory, for it is darkness unto me? And I can judge between thee
                and God; for God said unto me, “Worship God, for him only shalt thou serve.”
            </span></block>

            <block>
                <verse>16</verse><span>Get thee hence, Satan; deceive me not; for God said unto me, “Thou art
                after the similitude of mine Only Begotten.”
                </span><verse>17</verse><span>And he also gave me commandments when he called unto me out of the burning
                bush, saying, “Call upon God in the name of mine Only Begotten, and worship
                me.”
            </span></block>

        </quote>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>18</verse><span>And again Moses said:
        </span><quote><span>
            I will not cease to call upon God, I have other things to inquire of him:
            for his glory has been upon me, wherefore I can judge between him and
            thee. Depart hence, Satan.

        Second attempt
    </span></heading>

    <block>
        <verse>19</verse><span>And now, when Moses had said these words, Satan cried with a loud voice,
        and ranted
        upon the earth, and commanded, saying, “I am the Only Begotten, worship
        me.”
        </span><verse>20</verse><span>And it came to pass that Moses began to fear exceedingly; and as he began
        to fear, he saw the
        bitterness of hell. Nevertheless, calling upon God, he received strength,
        and he commanded, saying:
        </span><quote><span>
            Depart from me, Satan, for this one God only will I worship, which is
            the God of glory.
        </span></quote>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>21</verse><span>And now Satan began to tremble, and the earth shook; and Moses received
        strength, and called upon God, saying:
        </span><quote><span>
            In the name of the Only Begotten, depart hence, Satan.
        </span></quote>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>22</verse><span>And it came to pass that Satan cried with a loud voice, with weeping,
        and wailing, and gnashing of teeth; and he departed hence, even from the
        presence of Moses, that he beheld him not.
        </span><verse>23</verse><span>And now of this thing Moses bore record; but because of wickedness it
        is not had among the children of men.

        THE LORD RETURNS
    </span></blockheading>
    <block>
        <verse>24</verse><span>And it came to pass that when Satan had departed from the presence of
        Moses, that Moses lifted up his eyes unto heaven, being filled with the
        Holy Ghost, which beareth
        record of the Father and the Son;
        </span><verse>25</verse><span>and calling upon the name of God, he beheld his glory again, for it was
        upon him; and he heard a voice, saying:
        </span><quote><span>
            Blessed art thou, Moses,</span><break></break>
            <indent><span>for I, the Almighty, have chosen thee,</span></indent><span>

    <block>
        <verse>27</verse><span>And it came to pass, as the voice was still speaking, Moses cast his eyes
        and beheld the earth, yea, even all of it; and there was not a particle
        of it which he did not behold,
        discerning it by the Spirit of God.
        </span><verse>28</verse><span>And he beheld also the inhabitants thereof, and there was not a soul which
        he beheld not; and he discerned them by the Spirit of God; and their numbers
        were great, even numberless as the sand upon the sea shore.
        </span><verse>29</verse><span>And he beheld many lands; and each land was called earth, and there were
        inhabitants on the face thereof.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>30</verse><span>And it came to pass that Moses called upon God, saying:

        <verse>31</verse><span>And behold, the glory of the Lord was upon Moses, so that Moses stood

        <verse>1</verse><span>And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Moses, saying:</span><break></break><span>
        Behold, I reveal unto you concerning this heaven, and this earth; write
        the words which I speak. I am the Beginning and the End, the Almighty God;
        by mine Only Begotten I
        created these things; yea, in the beginning I created the heaven, and
        the earth upon which thou standest.
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>And the earth was without form, and void; and I caused darkness to come

        the light from the darkness.
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>And I, God, called the light day, and the darkness, I called night. And
