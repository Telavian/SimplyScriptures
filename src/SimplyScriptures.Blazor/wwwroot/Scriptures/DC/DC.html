                This edition of Doctrine And Covenants
                increases readability by modernizing the page
                layout. The text is formatted into standard paragraphs and white space and other modern
                tools (section headers, bullet lists, etc.) are used to help with readability. The verse and
                chapter numbering of the 1981 edition have been maintained to locate specific verses, but
                those references are visually subdued so as to not distract from the message.

                Words that are part of the scriptural record appear in serif font. Anything not part of that
                record (dates and locations, verse numbers, section numbers, and section headers) appears in this sans-serif font. Anything in a sans-serif font is an addition of men and can be treated
                accordingly.

                This edition captures some of the various changes that have been made to these works over
                time. Words that were changed between the 1833 Book Of Commandments
                and 1835 Doctrine And Covenants
                are indicated by an

                Other non-canonized records have been added to help with historical context. These appear
                in chronological position among the sections of
                Doctrine And Covenants. They have a
                similar header, including source information, but lack a section number. Those that aren’t
                found in History Of The Church
                are designated by JSP and can be found at the Joseph

        <span>
            Dear Brethren:
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <span>
            We deem it to be unnecessary to entertain you with a lengthy preface to
            the following volume, but merely to say, that it contains in short, the
            leading items of the religion which we have professed to believe.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <span>
            The first part of the book will be found to contain a series of Lectures
            as delivered before a Theological class in this place, and in consequence
            of their embracing the important
            doctrine of salvation, we have arranged them into the following work.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <span>
            The second part contains items or principles for the regulation of the
            church, as taken
            from the revelations which have been given since its organization, as
            well as from former ones.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <span>
            There may be an aversion in the minds of some against receiving any thing
            purporting to be articles of religious faith, in consequence of there being
            so many now extant; but if men believe a system, and profess that it was
            given by inspiration, certainly, the more
            intelligibly they can present it, the better. It does not make a principle
            untrue to print it, neither does it make it true not to print it.
        </span>
    </block>

        <span>
            The church viewing this subject to be of importance, appointed, through
            their servants and delegates the High Council, your servants to select
            and compile this work. Several reasons might be adduced in favor of this
            move of the Council, but we only add a few
            words. They knew that the church was evil spoken of in many places—its
            faith and belief misrepresented, and the way of truth thus subverted. By
            some it was represented as disbelieving the Bible,
            by others as being an enemy to all good order and uprightness, and by
            others as being injurious to the peace of all governments civil and political.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <span>
            We have, therefore, endeavored to present, though in few words, our belief,
            and when we say this, humbly trust, the faith and principles of this society
            as a body.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <span>
            We do not present this little volume with any other expectation than that
            we are to be
            called to answer to every principle advanced, in that day when the secrets
            of all hearts will be revealed, and the reward of every man's labor
            be given him.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <span>
            With sentiments of esteem and sincere respect, we subscribe ourselves
            your brethren in the bonds of the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.

            Faith being the first principle in revealed religion, and the foundation
            of all righteousness, necessarily claims the first place in a course of
            lectures which are designed to unfold to the understanding the doctrine
            of Jesus Christ.

            In presenting the subject of faith, we shall observe the following order:
        </span><dot>
            <verse>3</verse><span>
                First, faith itself—what it is.

            <verse>4</verse><span>
                Second, the object on which it rests;

            <verse>5</verse><span>
                Third, the effects which flow from it.

    <block>
        <verse>6</verse><span>
            Agreeable to this order we have first to show what faith is.

        <verse>7</verse><span>
            The author of the epistle to the Hebrews, in the eleventh chapter of that
            epistle, and first verse, gives the following definition of the word faith:
        </span><quote>
            <verse>8</verse><span>
                Now faith is the substance (assurance) of things hoped for, the evidence
                of things not seen.
            </span>
        </quote>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>9</verse><span>
            From this we learn that faith is the assurance which men have of the existence
            of things which they have not seen, and the principle of action in all
            intelligent beings.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>10</verse><span>
            If men were duly to consider themselves, and turn their thoughts and reflections
            to the operations of their own minds, they would readily discover that
            it is faith, and faith only, which is the moving cause of all action in
            them; that without it, both mind and body would be in a state of inactivity,
            and all their exertions would cease, both physical and mental.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>11</verse><span>
            Were this class to go back and reflect upon the history of their lives,
            from the period of their first recollection, and ask themselves what principle
            excited them to action, or what gave them energy and activity in all their
            lawful avocations, callings, and pursuits, what would be the answer? Would
            it not be that it was the assurance which we had of the
            existence of things which we had not seen as yet? Was it not the hope
            which you had, in consequence of your belief in the existence of unseen
            things, which stimulated you to action and exertion, in order to obtain
            them? Are you not dependent on your faith, or belief, for the acquisition
            of all knowledge, wisdom, and intelligence? Would you exert
            yourselves to obtain wisdom and intelligence, unless you did believe that
            you could obtain them? Would you have ever sown if you had not believed
            that you would reap? Would you have ever planted if you had not believed
            that you would gather? Would you have ever asked unless you had believed
            that you would receive? Would you have ever sought unless you had believed
            that you would have found? Or would you have ever knocked
            unless you had believed that it would have been opened unto you? In a
            word, is there anything that you would have done, either physical or mental,
            if you had not previously believed? Are not all your exertions of every
            kind dependent on your faith? Or may we not ask, what have you, or what
            do you possess, which you have not obtained by reason of your faith? Your
            food, your raiment, your lodgings, are they not all by reason of your
            faith? Reflect, and ask yourselves if these things are not so. Turn your
            thoughts on your own minds, and see if faith is not the moving cause of
            all action in yourselves; and if the moving cause in you, is it not in
            all other intelligent beings?
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>12</verse><span>
            And as faith is the moving cause of all action in temporal concerns, so
            it is in spiritual; for the Savior has said, and that truly, that “He that
            believeth and is baptized shall be saved” (Mark 16:16).
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>13</verse><span>
            As we receive by faith all temporal blessings that we do receive, so we
            in like manner
            receive by faith all spiritual blessings that we do receive. But faith
            is not only the principle of action, but of power also, in all intelligent
            beings, whether in heaven or on earth. Thus says the author of the epistle
            to the Hebrews 11:3:
        </span><quote>
            <verse>14</verse><span>
                Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of
                God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.
            </span>
        </quote>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>15</verse><span>
            By this we understand that the principle of power, which existed in the
            bosom of God, by which the worlds were framed, was faith; and that it is
            by reason of this principle of power existing in the Deity, that all created
            things exist—so that all things in heaven, on earth, or under the earth,
            exist by reason of faith, as it existed in Him.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>16</verse><span>
            Had it not been for the principle of faith, the worlds would never have
            been framed, neither would man have been formed of the dust. It is the
            principle by which Jehovah works, and through which he exercises power
            over all temporal, as well as eternal things. Take this principle or attribute
            (for it is an attribute) from the Deity, and he would cease to exist.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>17</verse><span>
            Who cannot see that if God framed the worlds by faith, that it is by faith
            that he exercises power over them, and that faith is the principle of power?
            And that if the
            principle of power, it must be so in man as well as in the Deity? This
            is the testimony of all the sacred writers, and the lesson which they have
            been endeavoring to teach to man.

        <verse>18</verse><span>
            The Savior says, in explaining the reason why the disciples could not
            cast out the devil, that it was because of their unbelief: “For verily
            I say unto you,” said he, “If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed,
            ye shall say unto this mountain, ‘Remove hence to yonder
            place!’ and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.”

            In addition to this we are told in Hebrews 11:32–35, that Gideon, Barak,
            Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets through faith subdued
            kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths
            of lions, quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword,
            out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in
            fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens, and that women received
            their dead raised to life again, etc.

            We here understand that the sacred writers say that all these things were
            done by faith. It was by faith that the worlds were framed—God spake, chaos
            heard, and worlds came into order, by reason of the faith there was in
            Him. So with man also—he spake by faith in the name of God, and the sun
            stood still, the moon obeyed, mountains removed, prisons fell,
            lions’ mouths were closed, the human heart lost its enmity, fire its violence,
            armies their power, the sword its terror, and death its dominion; and all
            this by reason of the faith
            which was in him.

            Had it not been for the faith which was in man, they might have spoken
            to the sun, the moon, the mountains, prisons, lions, the human heart, fire,
            armies, the sword, or to death in vain!

            Faith then, is the first great governing principle which has power, dominion,
            and authority over all things; by it they exist, by it they are upheld,
            by it they are changed, or by it they remain, agreeable to the will of
            God. Without it, there is no power, and
            without power there could be no creation, nor existence!

            It “is the assurance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.”
            (Hebrews 11:1)
            That is, it is the assurance we have of the existence of unseen things;
            and being the
            assurance which we have of the existence of unseen things, must be the
            principle of action in all intelligent beings.

            We here observe that God is the only supreme governor and independent
            being in whom all fulness and perfection dwells; who is omnipotent, omnipresent,
            and omniscient;
            without beginning of days or end of life; and that in him every good gift,
            and every good principle dwells; and that he is the Father of lights. In
            him the principle of faith dwells independently; and he is the object in
            whom the faith of all other rational and accountable beings centers for
            life and salvation.

            In order to present this part of the subject in a clear and conspicuous
            point of light, it is necessary to go back and show the evidences which
            mankind has had, and the foundation on which these evidences are, or were,
            based since the creation, to believe in the existence of a God.

            We do not mean those evidences which are manifested by the works of creation
            which we daily behold with our natural eyes. We are sensible that after
            a revelation of Jesus Christ, the works of creation throughout their vast
            forms and varieties, clearly exhibit his eternal power and Godhead. Romans
            1:20 “For the invisible things of him from the
            creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things
            that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead.” But we mean those evidences
            by which the first thoughts were suggested to the minds of men that there
            was a God who created all things.

            From the foregoing we learn man’s situation at his first creation; the
            knowledge with
            which he was endowed, and the high and exalted station in which he was
            placed—lord, or governor of all things on earth, and at the same time enjoying
            communion and intercourse with his Maker, without a vail to separate between.
            We shall next proceed to examine the account given of his fall, and of
            his being driven out of the garden of Eden, and from the presence of the

                    And they [Adam and Eve] heard the voice of the Lord God, as they were
                    walking in the garden, in the cool of the day. And Adam and his wife hid
                    themselves from the presence of the Lord God, among the trees of the garden.
                    And the Lord God called unto Adam, and said unto him, “Where are you going?”
                    And he said, “I heard your voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because
                    I beheld that I was naked, and I hid myself.”

            Two important items are shown from the former quotations. First, after
            man was
            created, he was not left without intelligence, or understanding, to wander
            in darkness, and spend an existence in ignorance and doubt on the great
            and important point which
            effected his happiness, as to the real fact by whom he was created, or
            unto whom he was amenable for his conduct. God conversed with him face
            to face. In his presence he was permitted to stand, and from his own mouth
            he was permitted to receive instruction—he heard his voice, walked before
            him, and gazed upon his glory, while intelligence burst
            upon his understanding, and enabled him to give names to the vast assemblage
            of his Maker’s works.

            Second, we have seen that though man did transgress, his transgression
            did not deprive him of the previous knowledge with which he was endowed,
            relative to the existence and glory of his Creator; for no sooner did he
            hear his voice, than he sought to hide himself
            from his presence.

                    and to have dominion over all the beasts of the field, and to eat his bread
                    by the sweat of his brow, as I, the Lord had commanded him...and he called
                    upon the name of the Lord, and so did Eve his wife also. And they heard
                    the voice of the Lord, from the way
                    toward the garden of Eden, speaking unto them, and they saw him not, for
                    they were shut out from his presence. But he gave unto them commandments,
                    that they should worship the Lord their God; and should offer the firstlings
                    of their flocks for an
                    offering unto the Lord. And Adam was obedient unto the commandment.

            our first parents were driven out of the garden of Eden, and were even
            separated from the presence of God by a vail, they still retained a knowledge
            of his existence, and that sufficiently to move them to call upon him.
            And further, that no sooner was the plan of redemption revealed to man

                    In process of time Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering
                    unto the Lord. And Abel also brought of the firstlings of his flock, and
                    of the fat thereof. And the Lord had respect unto Abel, and to his offering.
                    But unto Cain and to his offering, he had not respect. Now Satan knew this,
                    and it pleased him. And Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell.
                    And the Lord said unto Cain, “Why are you angry? Why is your countenance
                    fallen? If you do well will you not be accepted? And if you do not well,
                    sin lies at the door, and Satan desires to have you, and except you shall
                    hearken unto my commandments, I will deliver you up; and it shall be unto

            that it was by a manifestation of God to man, and that God continued, after
            man’s transgression, to manifest himself to him and his posterity; and

            laid the foundation for the exercise of their

            Not only was there a manifestation made unto Adam of the existence of

            talk with Cain after his
            great transgression in slaying his brother, and that Cain knew that it
            was the Lord that was talking with him; so that when he was driven out
            from the presence of his brethren, he
            carried with him the knowledge of the existence of a God. And through
            this means, doubtless, his posterity became acquainted with the fact that
            such a being existed.

            From this we can see that the whole human family in the early age of their
            existence, in all their different branches, had this knowledge disseminated
            among them; so that the
            existence of God became an object of faith in the early age of the world.
            And the
            evidences which these men had of the existence of a God, was the testimony
            of their fathers in the first instance.

            The reason why we have been thus particular on this part of our subject
            is that this class may see by what means it was that God became an object
            of faith among men after the
            fall, and what it was that stirred up the faith of multitudes to feel
            after him—to search after a knowledge of his character, perfections, and
            attributes, until they became
            extensively acquainted with him; and not only commune with him, and behold
            his glory, but be partakers of his power, and stand in his presence.

            Let this class mark particularly that the testimony which these men had
            of the existence of a God, was the testimony of man. For previous to the
            time that any of Adam’s posterity had obtained a manifestation of God to
            themselves, Adam, their common father, had testified unto them of the existence
            of God, and of his eternal power and Godhead.

            For instance, Abel, before he received the assurance from heaven that
            his offerings were acceptable unto God, had received the important information
            of his father that such a being did exist, who had created, and who did
            uphold all things. Neither can there be a doubt existing on the mind of
            any person, that Adam was the first who did communicate the knowledge of
            the existence of a God to his posterity; and that the whole faith of the
            world, from that time down to the present, is in a certain degree dependent
            on the knowledge first communicated to them by their common progenitor.
            And it has been handed down to the day and generation in which we live, as we shall show
            from the face of the sacred records.

            he begat Cainan 815 years, making him 905 years old when he died (5:10–11).
            And Cainan lived after he begat
            Mahalaleel 840 years, making him 910 years old at his death (5:13–14).
            And Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared 830 years, making him 895 years
            old when he died (5: 16–17). And Jared lived after he begat Enoch 800 years,
            making him 962 years old at his death (5:19–20). And Enoch walked with
            God after he begat Methuselah 300 years, making

            From the foregoing it is easily to be seen, not only how the knowledge
            of God came into the world, but upon what principle it was preserved; that
            from the time it was first communicated, it was retained in the minds of
            righteous men, who taught not only their own posterity, but the world;
            so that there was no need of a new revelation to man after Adam’s creation
            to Noah, to give them the first idea or notion of the existence of a God;
            and not only of a God, but of the true and living God.

            Having traced the chronology of the world from Adam to Noah, we will now
            trace it from Noah to Abraham. Noah was 502 years old when Shem was born—98
            years afterward the flood came, being the 600
        </span><superscript><span>th</span></superscript><span>
            year of Noah’s age. And Moses informs us that Noah lived after the flood
            350 years; making him 950 years old when he died (Genesis 9:28–29).

            Shem was 100 years old when Arphaxad was born (Genesis 11:10). Arphaxad
            was 35 when Salah was born (11:12). Salah was 30 when Eber was born (11:14).
            Eber was 34
            when Peleg was born, in whose days the earth was divided (11:16). Peleg
            was 30 when Reu was born (11:18). Reu was 32 when Serug was born (11:20).
            Serug was 30 when
            Nahor was born (11:22). Nahor was 29 when Terah was born (11:24). Terah
            was 70 when Haran and Abraham were born (11:26).

            There is some difficulty in the account given by Moses, of Abraham’s birth.
            Some have supposed that Abraham was not born until Terah was 130 years
            old. This conclusion is
            drawn from a variety of scriptures, which are not to our purpose at present
            to quote. Neither is it a matter of any consequence to us, whether Abraham
            was born when Terah was 70 years old, or 130. But in order that there may
            no doubt exist upon any mind, in
            relation to the object lying immediately before us in presenting the present
            chronology, we will date the birth of Abraham at the latest period—that
            is, when Terah was 130 years old. It appears from this account, that from
            the flood to the birth of Abraham was 352 years.

            Moses informs us that Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad 500 years (Genesis
            11:11).
            This added to 100 years, which was his age when Arphaxad was born, makes
            him 600 years old when he died. Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah 403
            years (11:13). This added to 35 years, which was his age when Salah was
            born, makes him 438 years old when he
            died. Salah lived after he begat Eber 403 years (11:15). This added to
            30 years, which was his age when Eber was born, makes him 433 years old
            when he died. Eber lived after he begat Peleg 430 years (11:17). This added
            to 34 years, which was his age when Peleg was born, makes him 464 years
            old. Peleg lived after he begat Reu 209 years (11:19). This
            added to 30 years, which was his age when Reu was born, makes him 239
            years old when he died. Reu lived after he begat Serug 207 years (11:21).
            This added to 32 years, which was his age when Serug was born, makes him
            239 years old when he died. Serug lived after he begat Nahor 200 years
            (11:23). This added to 30 years, which was his age when
            Nahor was born, makes him 230 years old when he died. Nahor lived after
            he begat Terah 119 years (11:25). This added to 29 years, which was his
            age when Terah was born, makes him 148 years old when he died. Terah was
            130 years old when Abraham was born, and is supposed to have lived 75 years
            after his birth, making him 205 years old when he died.

            We have now traced the chronology of the world, agreeable to the account
            given in our present Bible,
            from Adam to Abraham, and have clearly determined beyond the power of
            controversy, that there was no difficulty in preserving the knowledge of
            God in the world from the creation of Adam, and the manifestation made
            to his immediate descendants, as set forth in the former part of this lecture;
            so that the students in this class need not have any dubiety resting on
            their minds on this subject; for they can easily see that it is impossible
            for it to be otherwise, but that the knowledge of the existence of a God
            must have continued from father to son, as a matter of tradition, at least.
            For we cannot suppose that a knowledge of this important fact could have
            existed in the mind of any of the
            before-mentioned individuals, without their having made it known to their
            posterity.

            We have now shown how it was that the first thought ever existed in the
            mind of any individual, that there was such a being as a God who had created
            and did uphold all things; that it was by reason of the manifestation which
            he first made to our father Adam, when he stood in his presence and conversed
            with him face to face at the time of his
            creation.

            Let us here observe that after any portion of the human family is made
            acquainted with the important fact that there is a God who has created
            and does uphold all things, the extent of their knowledge respecting his
            character and glory, will depend upon their
            diligence and faithfulness in seeking after him, until like Enoch, the
            Brother of Jared, and Moses, they shall obtain faith in God, and power
            with him to behold him face to face.

            We have now clearly set forth how it is, and how it was, that God became
            an object of faith for rational beings; and also upon what foundation the
            testimony was based, which excited the inquiry and diligent search of the
            ancient saints to seek after and obtain a knowledge of the glory of God.
            And we have seen that it was human testimony, and
            human testimony only, that excited this inquiry in the first instance
            in their minds. It was the credence they gave to the testimony of their
            fathers—this testimony having aroused their minds to inquire after the
            knowledge of God. The enquiry frequently terminated, indeed, always terminated
            when rightly pursued, in the most glorious discoveries and eternal certainty.

                things, and we by him. (Lecture 2:2)

    <verse>6</verse><question>
        <span>
            How did men first come to the knowledge of the existence of a God, so
            as to exercise faith in him?
        </span>
    </question>
    <block>
        <span>
            In order to answer this question, it will be necessary to go back and
            examine man at his creation; the circumstances in which he was placed,
            and the knowledge which he had of God. (Lecture 2:3–11).
        </span><dot>
            <span>
                First, when man was created he stood in the presence of God (Genesis 1:27–28).
                From this we learn that man, at his creation, stood in the presence of
                his God, and had most perfect knowledge of his existence.

            <span>
                Second, God conversed with him after his transgression. (Genesis 3:8–22;
                Lecture 2:13–17) From this we learn that, though man did transgress, he
                was not deprived of the previous knowledge which he had of the existence
                of God. (Lecture 2:19)
            </span>

        <dot>
            <span>
                Third, God conversed with man after he cast him out of the garden. (Lecture
                2:22– 25).

            <span>
                Fourth, God also conversed with Cain after he had slain Abel. (Genesis
                4:4–16; Lecture 2:26–29).

    <verse>7</verse><question><span>What is the object of the foregoing quotation?</span></question>
    <block>
        <span>
            It is that it may be clearly seen how it was that the first thoughts were
            suggested to the minds of men of the existence of God, and how extensively
            this knowledge was spread among the immediate descendants of Adam (Lecture
            2:30–33).
        </span>
    </block>

    <verse>8</verse><question>
        <span>
            What testimony had the immediate descendants of Adam in proof of the existence
            of a God?
        </span>
    </question>
    <block>
        <span>
            The testimony of their father. And after they were made acquainted with
            his existence, by the testimony of their father, they were dependent upon
            the exercise of their own faith for a knowledge of his character, perfections
            and attributes (Lecture 2:23–26).

    <verse>9</verse><question>
        <span>
            Had any others of the human family, beside Adam, a knowledge of the existence
            of God, in the first instance, by any other means than human testimony?
        </span>
    </question>
    <block>
        <span>
            They had not. For previous to the time that they could have power to obtain
            a manifestation for themselves, the all-important fact had been communicated
            to them by their common father; and so from father to child the knowledge
            was communicated as extensively as the knowledge of his existence was known;
            for it was by this means, in the first instance, that men had a knowledge
            of his existence (Lecture 2:35–36).

            Into two parts: First, by embracing that period of the world from Adam
            to Noah; and second, from Noah to Abraham; from which period the knowledge
            of the existence of God has been so general that it is a matter of no dispute
            in what manner the idea of his existence has been retained in the world.

            In the second lecture it was shown how it was that the knowledge of the
            existence of God came into the world, and by what means the first thoughts
            were suggested to the minds of men that such a being did actually exist;
            and that it was by reason of the knowledge of his existence that there
            was a foundation laid for the exercise of faith in him, as the only being
            in whom faith could center for life and salvation. For faith could
            not center in a being of whose existence we had no idea, because the idea
            of his existence in the first instance is essential to the exercise of
            faith in him.

            Let us here observe, that three things are necessary, in order that any
            rational and intelligent being may exercise faith in God unto life and
            salvation:
        </span><dot>
            <verse>3</verse><span>
                First, the idea that he actually exists.
            </span>
        </dot>
        <dot>
            <verse>4</verse><span>
                Second, a correct idea of his character, perfections and attributes.
            </span>
        </dot>
        <dot>
            <verse>5</verse><span>
                Third, an actual knowledge that the course of life which he is pursuing,
                is according to his will.
            </span>
        </dot>
    </block>

    <block>
        <span>
            For without an acquaintance with these three important facts, the faith
            of every rational being must be imperfect and unproductive, but with this
            understanding, it can become perfect and fruitful, abounding in righteousness
            unto the praise and glory of God the
            Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.

            Having previously been made acquainted with the way the idea of his existence
            came into the world, as well as the fact of his existence, we shall proceed
            to examine his
            character, perfections, and attributes in order that this class may see,
            not only the just grounds which they have for the exercise of faith in
            him for life and salvation, but the reasons that all the world also, as
            far as the idea of his existence extends, may have to exercise faith in
            him, the Father of all living.

            As we have been indebted to a revelation which God made of himself to
            his creatures in the first instance, for the idea of his existence, so
            in like manner we are indebted to the
            revelations which he has given to us for a correct understanding of his
            character,
            perfections, and attributes; because without the revelations which he
            has given to us, no man by searching could find out God (Job 11:7–9).

                1 Corinthians 2:9–11 But as it is written, “Eye has not seen, nor ear
                heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God
                has prepared for them that love him.” But God has revealed them unto us
                by his Spirit: for the Spirit searches all things, yea, the deep things
                of God. For what man knows the things of a man, save the spirit of man
                which is in him? even so the things of God no man knows, but by the Spirit
                of God.

            From the foregoing testimonies, we learn the following things respecting

        </span><dot>
            <verse>13</verse><span>
                First, that he was God before the world was created, and the same God

                Third, that he changes not, neither is there variableness with him; but
                that he is the same from everlasting to everlasting, being the same yesterday
                today and forever; and that his course is one eternal round, without variation.

            An acquaintance with these attributes in the divine character, is essentially
            necessary, in order that the faith of any rational being can center in
            him for life and salvation. For if he did not in the first instance believe
            him to be God, that is, the creator and upholder of all things, he could
            not center his faith in him for life and salvation; for fear there should
            be a greater than he, who would thwart all his plans; and he, like the
            gods of the heathen,
            would be unable to fulfil his promises; but seeing he is God over all,
            from everlasting to everlasting, the creator and upholder of all things,
            no such fear can exist in the minds of those who put their trust in him,
            so that in this respect their faith can be without wavering.

            But second, unless he was merciful and gracious, slow to anger, long-suffering,
            and full of goodness, such is the weakness of human nature, and so great
            the frailties and
            imperfections of men, that unless they believed that these excellencies
            existed in the divine character, the faith necessary to salvation could
            not exist; for doubt would take the place of faith, and those who know
            their weakness and liability to sin, would be in constant doubt of salvation,
            if it were not for the idea which they have of the excellency of the
            character of God, that he is slow to anger, and long-suffering, and of
            a forgiving disposition, and does forgive iniquity, transgression and sin.

    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>21</verse><span>
            An idea of these facts does away doubt, and makes faith exceedingly strong.
            But it is equally as necessary that men should have the idea that he is
            a God who changes not, in order to have faith in him, as it is to have
            the idea that he is gracious and long-suffering. For without the idea of
            unchangeableness in the character of the Deity, doubt would take the place
            of faith. But with the idea that he changes not, faith lays hold upon the
            excellencies in his character with unshaken confidence, believing he is
            the same yesterday, today, and forever, and that his course is one eternal
            round.

    <block>
        <verse>22</verse><span>
            And again, the idea that he is a God of truth and cannot lie, is equally
            as necessary to the exercise of faith in him, as the idea of his unchangeableness.
            For without the idea that he was a God of truth and could not lie, the
            confidence necessary to be placed in his word in order to the exercise
            of faith in him could not exist. But having the idea that he is not man
            that he can lie, it gives power to the minds of men to exercise faith in
            him.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>23</verse><span>
            But it is also necessary that men should have an idea that he is no respecter
            of persons. For with the idea of all the other excellencies in his character,
            and this one wanting, men could not exercise faith in him, because if he
            were a respecter of persons, they could not tell what their privileges
            were, nor how far they were authorized to exercise faith in him, or whether
            they were authorized to do it at all, but all must be confusion; but no
            sooner are the minds of men made acquainted with the truth on this point
            (that he is no respecter of persons), than they see that they have authority
            by faith to lay hold on eternal life, the
            richest boon of heaven, because God is no respecter of persons, and that
            every man in every nation has an equal privilege.

        <verse>24</verse><span>
            And lastly, but not less important to the exercise of faith in God, is
            the idea that he is love; for with all the other excellencies in his character,
            without this one to influence them, they could not have such powerful dominion
            over the minds of men; but when the idea is planted in the mind that he
            is love, who cannot see the just ground that men of
            every nation, kindred, and tongue, have to exercise faith in God so as
            to obtain eternal life?

            From the above description of the character of the Deity which is given
            by him in the
            revelations to men, there is a sure foundation for the exercise of faith
            in him among every people, nation, and kindred, from age to age, and from
            generation to generation.

            Let us here observe that the foregoing is the character which is given
            of God in his
            revelations to the Former Day Saints, and it is also the character which
            is given of him in his revelations to the Latter Day Saints, so that the
            saints of former days and those of latter days are both alike in this respect;
            the Latter Day Saints having as good grounds to
            exercise faith in God as the Former Day Saints had, because the same character
            is given of him to both.

    <verse>6</verse><question><span>What are they?</span></question>
    <block>
        <span>
            First, that God does actually exist; second, correct ideas of his character,
            his perfections, and attributes; and third, that the course which we pursue
            is according to his mind and will (Lecture 3:3–5).

    <verse>7</verse><question>
        <span>
            Would the idea of any one or two of the above-mentioned things, enable

        </span>
    </question>
    <block>
        <span>
            It would not, for without the idea of them all, faith would be imperfect
            and unproductive (Lecture 3:5).
        </span>
    </block>

    <verse>8</verse><question>
        <span>

        </span>
    </question>
    <block>
        <span>
            It would; for by the idea of these three things, faith could become perfect

            (Lecture 3:5).

    <block>
        <span>
            We learn the six following things: First, that he was God before the world
            was created, and the same God that he was after it was created. Second,
            that he is merciful and
            gracious, slow to anger, abundant in goodness, and that he was so from
            everlasting, and
            will be so to everlasting. Third, that he changes not, neither is there
            variableness with him, and that his course is one eternal round. Fourth,
            that he is a God of truth and cannot lie.
            Fifth, that he is no respecter of persons; and sixth, that he is love
            (Lecture 3:12–18).

    <verse>13</verse><question>
        <span>
            Where do you find the revelations which give us this idea of the character

    <block>
        <span>
            In the Bible and

    <verse>14</verse><question>
        <span>
            What effect would it have on any rational being not to have an idea that

        </span>
    </question>
    <block>
        <span>
            It would prevent him from exercising faith in him unto life and salvation.

    </block>

    <verse>15</verse><question><span>Why would it prevent him from exercising faith in God?</span></question>
    <block>
        <span>
            Because he would be as the heathen, not knowing but there might be a being
            greater and more powerful than he; and thereby he be prevented from fulfilling
            His promises (Lecture 3:19).

    <verse>16</verse><question><span>Does this idea prevent this doubt?</span></question>

        <span>
            It does; for persons having this idea are enabled thereby to exercise
            faith without this doubt (Lecture 3:19).
        </span>
    </block>

    <verse>17</verse><question>
        <span>
            Is it not also necessary to have the idea that God is merciful and gracious,
            long-suffering and full of goodness?
        </span>
    </question>
    <block>
        <span>
            It is (Lecture 3:20).
        </span>
    </block>

    <verse>18</verse><question><span>Why is it necessary?</span></question>
    <block>
        <span>
            Because of the weakness and imperfections of human nature, and the great
            frailties of man; for such is the weakness of man, and such his frailties,
            that he is liable to sin continually, and if God were not long-suffering
            and full of compassion, gracious and merciful, and of a forgiving disposition,
            man would be cut off from before him; in consequence of which he would
            be in continual doubt and could not exercise faith; for where doubt is,
            there faith has no power; but by man’s believing that God is full of compassion
            and forgiveness, longsuffering and slow to anger, he can exercise faith
            in him and overcome doubt, so as to be exceedingly strong (Lecture 3:20).
        </span>
    </block>

    <verse>19</verse><question>
        <span>
            Is it not equally as necessary that man should have an idea that God changes
            not, neither is there variableness with him, in order to exercise faith
            in him unto life and salvation?
        </span>
    </question>
    <block>
        <span>
            It is; because without this, he would not know how soon the mercy of God
            might change into cruelty, his long-suffering into rashness, his love into
            hatred, and in consequence of which doubt man would be incapable of exercising
            faith in him; but having the idea that he is unchangeable, man can have
            faith in him continually, believing that what he was
            yesterday, he is today, and will be forever (Lecture 3:21).
        </span>
    </block>

    <verse>20</verse><question>
        <span>
            It is not necessary also, for men to have an idea that God is a being
            of truth, before they can have perfect faith in him?
        </span>
    </question>
    <block>
        <span>
            It is; for unless men have this idea they cannot place confidence in his
            word, and not being able to place confidence in his word, they could not
            have faith in him; but believing that he is a God of truth, and that his
            word cannot fail, then faith can rest in him without doubt (Lecture 3:22).
        </span>
    </block>

    <verse>21</verse><question>
        <span>
            Could man exercise faith in God so as to obtain eternal life unless he
            believed that God was no respecter of persons?
        </span>
    </question>
    <block>
        <span>
            He could not; because without this idea he could not certainly know that
            it was his privilege so to do, and in consequence of this doubt his faith
            could not be sufficiently strong to save him (Lecture 3:23).
        </span>
    </block>

    <verse>22</verse><question>
        <span>
            Would it be possible for a man to exercise faith in God, so as to be saved,
            unless he had an idea that God was love?
        </span>
    </question>
    <block>
        <span>
            He could not; because man could not love God unless he had an idea that
            God was love, and if he did not love God, he could not have faith in him
            (Lecture 3:24).

    <block>
        <span>
            It is calculated to lay a foundation for the exercise of faith in him,

            It is; in all his revelations whether to the Former Day Saints, or to
            the Latter Day Saints, so that they all have the authority to exercise
            faith in him, and to expect by the exercise of their faith to enjoy the

            Having shown in the third lecture, that correct ideas of the character
            of God are necessary in order to the exercise of faith in him unto life
            and salvation, and that without correct
            ideas of his character, the minds of men could not have sufficient power
            with God to the exercise of faith necessary to the enjoyment of eternal
            life, and that correct ideas of his
            character lay a foundation as far as his character is concerned for the
            exercise of faith, so as to enjoy the fulness of the blessing of the gospel
            of Jesus Christ, even that of eternal glory; we shall now proceed to show
            the connection there is between correct ideas of the
            attributes of God, and the exercise of faith in him unto eternal life.

        <verse>2</verse><span>
            Let us here observe that the real design which the God of heaven had in
            view in making the human family acquainted with his attributes, was that
            they through the ideas of the existence of his attributes, might be enabled
            to exercise faith in him, and through the
            exercise of faith in him, might obtain eternal life. For without the idea
            of the existence of the attributes which belong to God, the minds of men
            could not have power to exercise
            faith on him so as to lay hold upon eternal life. The God of heaven understanding
            most perfectly the constitution of human nature, and the weakness of man,
            knew what was necessary to be revealed, and what ideas must be planted
            in their minds in order that they might be enabled to exercise faith in
            him unto eternal life.

    <block>
        <verse>3</verse><span>
            Having said so much, we shall proceed to examine the attributes of God,
            as set forth in his revelations to the human family, and to show how necessary
            correct ideas of his
            attributes are, to enable men to exercise faith in him. For without these
            ideas being
            planted in the minds of men, it would be out of the power of any person
            or persons to
            exercise faith in God so as to obtain eternal life. So that the divine
            communications made to man in the first instance, were designed to establish
            in their minds the ideas necessary to enable them to exercise faith in
            God, and through this means to be partakers of his glory.

            By a little reflection it will be seen that the idea of the existence
            of these attributes in the Deity is necessary to enable any rational being
            to exercise faith in him. For without the
            idea of the existence of these attributes in the Deity, men could not
            exercise faith in him for life and salvation; seeing that without the knowledge
            of all things, God would not be able to save any portion of his creatures;
            for it is by reason of the knowledge which he has of all things, from the
            beginning to the end, that enables him to give that understanding to his
            creatures, by which they are made partakers of eternal life; and if it
            were not for the
            idea existing in the minds of men that God had all knowledge, it would
            be impossible for them to exercise faith in him.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>12</verse><span>
            And it is not less necessary that men should have the idea of the existence
            of the attribute power in the Deity. For unless God had power over all
            things, and was able by his power to control all things, and thereby deliver
            his creatures who put their trust in him from the power of all beings that
            might seek their destruction, whether in heaven, on earth, or in hell,
            men could not be saved; but with the idea of the existence of this attribute
            planted in the mind, men feel as though they had nothing to fear who put
            their trust in God,
            believing that he has power to save all who come to him, to the very uttermost.

    <block>
        <verse>13</verse><span>
            It is also necessary in order to the exercise of faith in God, unto life
            and salvation, that men should have the idea of the existence of the attribute
            justice in him. For without the idea of the existence of the attribute
            justice in the Deity, men could not have confidence sufficiently to place
            themselves under his guidance and direction; for they would be filled
            with fear and doubt, lest the Judge of all the earth would not do right;
            and thus fear, or doubt, existing in the mind, would preclude the possibility
            of the exercise of faith in him for life and salvation. But when the idea
            of the existence of the attribute justice in the
            Deity, is fairly planted in the mind, it leaves no room for doubt to get
            into the heart, and the mind is enabled to cast itself upon the Almighty
            without fear and without doubt, and with most unshaken confidence, believing
            that the Judge of all the earth will do right.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>14</verse><span>
            It is also of equal importance that men should have the idea of the existence
            of the attribute judgment in God, in order that they may exercise faith
            in him for life and
            salvation; for without the idea of the existence of this attribute in
            the Deity, it would be impossible for men to exercise faith in him for
            life and salvation, seeing that it is through the exercise of this attribute
            that the faithful in Christ Jesus are delivered out of the hands of those
            who seek their destruction; for if God were not to come out in swift judgment
            against the workers of iniquity and the powers of darkness, his saints
            could not be saved; for it is by judgment that the Lord delivers his saints
            out of the hands of all their enemies, and those who reject the gospel
            of our Lord Jesus Christ. But no sooner is the idea of the existence of
            this attribute planted in the minds of men, than it gives power to the
            mind for the exercise of faith and confidence in God. And they are enabled
            by faith to lay hold on the promises which are set before them, and wade
            through all the tribulations and
            afflictions to which they are subjected by reason of the persecution from
            those who know not God, and obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ;
            believing that in due time the Lord will come out in swift judgment against
            their enemies, and they shall be cut off from before him, and that in his
            own due time he will bear them off conquerors and more than conquerors
            in all things.

        <verse>15</verse><span>
            And again it is equally important that men should have the idea of the
            existence of the attribute mercy in the Deity, in order to exercise faith
            in him for life and salvation. For without the idea of the existence of
            this attribute in the Deity, the spirits of the saints would faint in the
            midst of the tribulations, afflictions, and persecutions which they have
            to endure for righteousness’ sake; but when the idea of the existence of
            this attribute is once established in the mind, it gives life and energy
            to the spirits of the saints; believing that the mercy of God will be poured
            out upon them in the midst of their afflictions, and that he will compassionate
            them in their sufferings, and that the mercy of God will lay hold of them
            and secure them in the arms of his love, so that they will receive a full
            reward for all their sufferings.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>16</verse><span>
            And lastly, but not less important to the exercise of faith in God, is
            the idea of the existence of the attribute truth in him. For without the
            idea of the existence of this
            attribute, the mind of man could have nothing upon which it could rest
            with certainty. All would be confusion and doubt, but with the idea of
            the existence of this attribute in the Deity in the mind, all the teachings,
            instructions, promises, and blessings become
            realities, and the mind is enabled to lay hold of them with certainty
            and confidence. Believing that these things, and all that the Lord has
            said, shall be fulfilled in their time;
            and that all the cursings, denunciations, and judgments pronounced upon
            the heads of the unrighteous will also be executed in the due time of the
            Lord; and by reason of the truth and veracity of him, the mind beholds
            its deliverance and salvation as being certain.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>17</verse><span>
            Let the mind once reflect sincerely and candidly upon the ideas of the
            existence of the before-mentioned attributes in the Deity, and it will
            be seen that as far as his attributes are concerned, there is a sure foundation
            laid for the exercise of faith in him for life and
            salvation. For inasmuch as God possesses the attribute knowledge, he can
            make all things known to his saints necessary for their salvation; and
            as he possesses the attribute power he is able thereby to deliver them
            from the power of all enemies; and seeing also, that justice
            is an attribute of the Deity, he will deal with them upon the principles
            of righteousness and equity, and a just reward will be granted unto them
            for all their afflictions and
            sufferings for the truth’s sake. And as judgment is an attribute of the
            Deity also, his saints can have the most unshaken confidence that they
            will, in due time, obtain a perfect
            deliverance out of the hands of all their enemies, and a complete victory
            over all those
            who have sought their hurt and destruction. And as mercy is also an attribute
            of the Deity, his saints can have confidence that it will be exercised
            toward them; and through the
            exercise of that attribute toward them, comfort and consolation will be
            administered unto them abundantly, amid all their afflictions and tribulations.
            And lastly, realizing that truth is an attribute of the Deity, the mind
            is led to rejoice amid all its trials and temptations, in hope of that
            glory which is to be brought at the revelation of Jesus Christ; and in
            view of that crown which is to be placed upon the heads of the saints in
            the day when the Lord shall distribute rewards unto them, and in prospect
            of that eternal weight of glory, which the Lord has promised to bestow
            upon them, when he shall bring them into the midst of his throne to dwell
            in his presence eternally.

        <verse>18</verse><span>
            In view, then, of the existence of these attributes, the faith of the
            saints can become
            exceedingly strong, abounding in righteousness unto the praise and glory
            of God, and can exert its mighty influence in searching after wisdom and
            understanding, until it has obtained a knowledge of all things that pertain
            to life and salvation.

            Such then is the foundation which is laid through the revelation of the
            attributes of God for the exercise of faith in him for life and salvation;
            and seeing that these are attributes of the Deity, they are unchangeable—being
            the same yesterday, today and forever—which gives to the minds of the Latter
            Day Saints the same power and authority to exercise faith in God which
            the Former Day Saints had. So that all the saints in this respect have
            been, are, and will be alike until the end of time; for God never changes,
            therefore his attributes and character remain forever the same. And as
            it is through the revelation of these that a foundation is laid for the
            exercise of faith in God unto life and salvation. The foundation, therefore,
            for the exercise of faith was, is, and ever will be the same. So that all
            men have had, and will have, an equal privilege.

            In our former lectures we treated of the being, character, perfections,
            and attributes of God. What we mean by perfections is, the perfections
            which belong to all the attributes of his nature. We shall in this lecture
            speak of the Godhead; we mean the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

        <verse>2</verse><span>
            There are two personages who constitute the great, matchless, governing,
            and supreme power over all things—by whom all things were created and made
            that are created and made, whether visible or invisible; whether in heaven,
            on earth, or in the earth, under the earth, or throughout the immensity
            of space. They are the Father and the Son: The Father being a personage
            of spirit, glory, and power, possessing all perfection and fulness. The
            Son, who was in the bosom of the Father, a personage of tabernacle, made
            or fashioned
            like unto man, or being in the form and likeness of man—or rather, man
            was formed after his likeness and in his image. He is also the express
            image and likeness of the personage of the Father, possessing all the fulness
            of the Father, or the same fulness with the Father, being begotten of him;
            and was ordained from before the foundation of the world to be a propitiation
            for the sins of all those who should believe on his name; and is called
            the Son because of the flesh—and descended in suffering below that which
            man can suffer, or in other words, suffered greater sufferings, and was
            exposed to more powerful contradictions than any man can be. But notwithstanding
            all this, he kept the law of God and remained without sin; showing thereby
            that it is in the power of man to keep the law and remain also without
            sin. And also, that by him a righteous judgment might come upon all flesh,
            and that all who walk not in the law of God, may justly be condemned by
            the law, and have no excuse for their sins. And he being the Only Begotten
            of the Father, full of grace and truth, and having overcome, received a
            fulness of the glory of the Father—possessing the same mind with the Father;
            which Mind is the Holy Spirit, that bears record of the
            Father and the Son; and these three are one, or in other words, these
            three constitute the great, matchless, governing, and supreme power over
            all things; by whom all things were created and made, that were created
            and made: and these three constitute the Godhead and are one: the Father
            and the Son possessing the same mind, the same wisdom, glory, power, and
            fulness; filling all in all—the Son being filled with the fulness of the
            Mind, glory, and power; or in other words the Spirit, glory, and power
            of the Father—possessing all knowledge and glory, and the same kingdom;
            sitting at the right hand of power, in the express image and likeness of
            the Father—a Mediator for man—being filled with the
            fulness of the Mind of the Father, or in other words, the Spirit of the
            Father; which Spirit is shed forth upon all who believe on his name and
            keep his commandments; and all those who keep his commandments shall grow
            up from grace to grace, and become heirs of the heavenly kingdom, and joint
            heirs with Jesus Christ; possessing the same mind, being
            transformed into the same image or likeness, even the express image of
            him who fills all in all; being filled with the fulness of his glory, and
            become one in him, even as the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are one.

            From the foregoing account of the Godhead, which is given in his revelations,
            the saints have a sure foundation laid for the exercise of faith unto life
            and salvation, through the atonement and mediation of Jesus Christ, by
            whose blood they have a forgiveness of sins, and also a sure reward laid
            up for them in heaven—even that of partaking of the fulness of the Father
            and the Son, through the Spirit. As the Son partakes of the fulness of
            the Father through the Spirit, so the saints are, by the same Spirit, to
            be partakers of the same fulness, to enjoy the same glory; for as the Father
            and the Son are one, so in like manner the saints
            are to be one in them through the love of the Father, the mediation of
            Jesus Christ, and the gift of the Holy Spirit; they are to be heirs of
            God and joint heirs with Jesus Christ.

                    face of his throne, and spreads his cloud upon it. He has compassed the

        <verse>1</verse><span>
            Having treated in the preceding lectures of the ideas of the character,
            perfections, and attributes of God, we next proceed to treat of the knowledge
            which persons must have
            that the course of life which they pursue is according to the will of
            God, in order that they may be enabled to exercise faith in him unto life
            and salvation.

            This knowledge supplies an important place in revealed religion; for it
            was by reason of it that the ancients were enabled to endure as seeing
            him who is invisible. An actual
            knowledge to any person that the course of life which he pursues is according
            to the will of God, is essentially necessary to enable him to have that
            confidence in God, without
            which no person can obtain eternal life. It was this that enabled the
            ancient saints to endure all their afflictions and persecutions, and to
            take joyfully the spoiling of their goods, knowing (not believing merely)
            that they had a more “enduring substance” (Hebrews 10:34).

        <verse>3</verse><span>
            Having the assurance that they were pursuing a course which was agreeable
            to the will of God, they were enabled to take, not only the spoiling of
            their goods and the wasting of their substance joyfully, but also to suffer
            death in its most horrid forms; knowing (not merely believing) that when
            this earthly house of their tabernacle was dissolved, they had a building
            of God, a house “not made with hands, eternal in the heavens” (2 Corinthians
            5:1).

            Such was, and always will be, the situation of the saints of God, that
            unless they have an actual knowledge that the course that they are pursuing
            is according to the will of God, they will grow weary in their minds and
            faint; for such has been, and always will be, the opposition in the hearts
            of unbelievers and those that know not God, against the pure and unadulterated
            religion of heaven (the only thing which ensures eternal life), that they
            will persecute to the uttermost all that worship God according to his revelations,
            receive the truth in the love of it, and submit themselves to be guided
            and directed by his will, and
            drive them to such extremities that nothing short of an actual knowledge
            of their being the favorites of heaven, and of their having embraced that
            order of things which God has established for the redemption of man, will
            enable them to exercise that confidence in him necessary for them to overcome
            the world, and obtain that crown of glory which is laid up for them that
            fear God.

            For a man to lay down his all, his character and reputation, his honor
            and applause, his good name among men, his houses, his lands, his brothers
            and sisters, his wife and
            children, and even his own life also, counting all things but filth and
            dross for the
            excellency of the knowledge of Jesus Christ, requires more than mere belief
            or supposition that he is doing the will of God, but actual knowledge;
            realizing that when these
            sufferings are ended he will enter into eternal rest, and be a partaker
            of the glory of God.

            For unless a person does know that he is walking according to the will
            of God, it would be offering an insult to the dignity of the Creator were
            he to say that he would be a partaker of his glory when he should be done
            with the things of this life. But when he has this knowledge, and most
            assuredly knows that he is doing the will of God, his confidence can be
            equally strong that he will be a partaker of the glory of God.

        <verse>7</verse><span>
            Let us here observe, that a religion that does not require the sacrifice
            of all things, never has power sufficient to produce the faith necessary
            unto life and salvation; for from the first existence of man, the faith
            necessary unto the enjoyment of life and salvation never could be obtained
            without the sacrifice of all earthly things; it was through this sacrifice,
            and this only, that God has ordained that men should enjoy eternal life;
            and it is through the medium of the sacrifice of all earthly things, that
            men do actually know that they are doing the things that are well pleasing
            in the sight of God. When a man has offered in sacrifice all that he has
            for the truth’s sake, not even withholding his life, and believing before
            God that he has been called to make this sacrifice, because he seeks to
            do his will, he does know most assuredly that God does and will accept
            his sacrifice and offering, and that he has not nor will not seek his face
            in vain. Under these circumstances then, he can obtain the faith necessary
            for him to lay hold on eternal life.

            It is in vain for persons to fancy to themselves that they are heirs with
            those, or can be heirs with them, who have offered their all in sacrifice,
            and by this means obtained faith in God and favor with him so as to obtain
            eternal life, unless they in like manner offer unto him the same sacrifice,
            and through that offering obtain the knowledge that they are
            accepted of him.

            It was in offering sacrifices that Abel, the first martyr, obtained knowledge
            that he was accepted of God. And from the days of righteous Abel to the
            present time, the knowledge that men have that they are accepted in the
            sight of God, is obtained by offering sacrifice. And in the last days,
            before the Lord comes, he is to gather together his saints who have made
            a covenant with him by sacrifice. Psalm 50:3–5 “Our God shall come, and
            shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be
            very tempestuous round about
            him. He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he
            may judge his people. Gather my saints together unto me; those that have
            made a covenant unto me by sacrifice.”
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>10</verse><span>
            Those then who make the sacrifice will have the testimony that their course
            is pleasing in the sight of God, and those who have this testimony will
            have faith to lay hold on eternal life, and will be enabled through faith
            to endure unto the end, and receive the
            crown that is laid up for them that love the appearing of our Lord Jesus
            Christ. But those who do not make the sacrifice cannot enjoy this faith,
            because men are dependent upon this sacrifice in order to obtain this faith;
            therefore, they cannot lay hold upon eternal life, because the revelations
            of God do not guarantee unto them the authority so to do; and
            without this guarantee faith could not exist.

        <verse>11</verse><span>
            All the saints of whom we have account in all the revelations of God which
            are extant, obtained the knowledge which they had of their acceptance in
            his sight, through the
            sacrifice which they offered unto him. And through the knowledge thus
            obtained, their
            faith became sufficiently strong to lay hold upon the promise of eternal
            life, and to endure as seeing him who is invisible; and were enabled, through
            faith, to combat the powers of darkness, contend against the wiles of the
            adversary, overcome the world, and obtain the end of their faith, even
            the salvation of their souls.

            But those who have not made this sacrifice to God, do not know that the
            course which they pursue is well pleasing in his sight; for whatever may
            be their belief or their opinion, it is a matter of doubt and uncertainty
            in their mind; and where doubt and uncertainty is, there faith is not,
            nor can it be. For doubt and faith do not exist in the same person at the
            same time. So that persons whose minds are under doubts and fears cannot
            have unshaken confidence; and where unshaken confidence is not, there faith
            is weak; and where faith is weak, the persons will not be able to contend
            against all the opposition, tribulations, and afflictions which they will
            have to encounter in order to be heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ
            Jesus; and they will grow weary in their minds, and the adversary will
            have power over them and destroy them.

            In the preceding lectures, we treated of what faith was, and of the object

            As we have seen in our former lectures that faith was the principle of
            action and of power in all intelligent beings, both in heaven and on earth,
            it will not be expected that we will in a lecture of this description attempt
            to unfold all its effects; neither is it necessary to our purpose so to
            do; for it would embrace all things in heaven and on earth, and encompass
            all the creations of God, with all their endless varieties. For no world
            has yet been framed that was not framed by faith; neither has there been
            an intelligent being on any of God’s creations who did not get there by
            reason of faith, as it existed in himself or in some other
            being; nor has there been a change or a revolution in any of the creations
            of God but it has been effected by faith. Neither will there be a change
            or a revolution unless it is effected in the same way in any of the vast
            creations of the Almighty; for it is by faith that the Deity works.

            Let us here offer some explanation in relation to faith that our meaning
            may be clearly comprehended. We ask then, what are we to understand by
            a man’s working by faith? We answer, We understand that when a man works
            by faith he works by mental exertion instead of physical force. It is by
            words instead of exerting his physical powers, with which every being works
            when he works by faith. God said, “Let there be light: and there was
            light”. Joshua spake, and the great lights which God had created stood
            still. Elijah commanded, and the heavens were stayed for the space of three
            years and six months, so that it did not rain. He again commanded, and
            the heavens gave forth rain. All this was done by faith, and the Savior
            says, If you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, say to this mountain,
            “Remove,” and it will remove; or say to this sycamore tree, “Be ye plucked
            up and planted in the midst of the sea;” and it shall obey you. Faith then
            works by words, and with these its mightiest works have been, and will
            be, performed.

            It surely will not be required of us to prove that this is the principle
            upon which all
            eternity has acted and will act; for every reflecting mind must know that
            it is by reason of this power that all the hosts of heaven perform their
            works of wonder, majesty, and glory. Angels move from place to place by
            virtue of this power—it is by reason of it that they are enabled to descend
            from heaven to earth; and were it not for the power of faith, they
            never could be ministering spirits to them who should be heirs of salvation,
            neither could they act as heavenly messengers; for they would be destitute
            of the power necessary to enable them to do the will of God.

            It is only necessary for us to say that the whole visible creation, as
            it now exists, is the effect of faith. It was faith by which it was framed,
            and it is by the power of faith that it continues in its organized form,
            and by which the planets move round their orbits and sparkle forth their
            glory. So then faith is truly the first principle in the science of
            Theology, and when understood, leads the mind back to the beginning and
            carries it forward to the end; or in other words, from eternity to eternity.

            As faith then is the principle by which the heavenly hosts perform their
            works, and by
            which they enjoy all their felicity, we might expect to find it set forth
            in a revelation from God as the principle upon which his creatures here
            below must act, in order to obtain the felicities enjoyed by the saints
            in the eternal world; and that when God would undertake to raise up men
            for the enjoyment of himself, he would teach them the necessity of living
            by faith; and the impossibility there was of their enjoying the blessedness
            of eternity without it, seeing that all the blessings of eternity are the
            effects of faith.

            Therefore it is said, and appropriately too, that without faith it is
            impossible to please God. If it should be asked, Why is it impossible to
            please God without faith? the answer would be because without faith it
            is impossible for men to be saved; and as God desires the salvation of
            man, he must of course desire that they should have faith, and he could
            not be pleased unless they had, or else he could be pleased with their
            destruction.

            From this we learn that the many exhortations which have been given by
            inspired men to those who had received the word of the Lord, to have faith
            in him, were not mere common-place matters, but were for the best of all
            reasons; and that was because without it there was no salvation, neither
            in this world nor in that which is to come. When men begin to live by faith,
            they begin to draw near to God; and when faith is perfected, they
            are like him; and because he is saved they are saved also; for they will
            be in the same
            situation he is in, because they have come to him; and when he appears
            they shall be like him, for they will see him as he is.

        <verse>9</verse><span>
            As all the visible creation is an effect of faith, so is salvation also.
            (We mean salvation in its most extensive latitude of interpretation, whether
            it is temporal or spiritual.) In order to have this subject clearly set
            before the mind, let us ask what situation must a person be in, in order
            to be saved? Or what is the difference between a saved man and one who
            is not saved? We answer from what we have before seen of the heavenly worlds:
            they must be persons who can work by faith, and who are able by faith,
            to be ministering spirits to them who shall be heirs of salvation. And
            they must have faith to enable them to act in the presence of the Lord,
            otherwise they cannot be saved. And what constitutes the real
            difference between a saved person and one not saved, is the difference
            in the degree of their faith. One’s faith has become perfect enough to
            lay hold upon eternal life, and the other’s has not. But to be a little
            more particular let us ask, where shall we find a prototype into whose
            likeness we may be assimilated, in order that we may be made
            partakers of life and salvation? Or in other words, where shall we find
            a saved being? For if we can find a saved being, we may ascertain without
            much difficulty, what all others must be in order to be saved. They must
            be like that individual or they cannot be saved. We think that it will
            not be a matter of dispute, that two beings who are unlike each other cannot
            both be saved; for whatever constitutes the salvation of one, will constitute
            the salvation of every creature which will be saved. And if we find one
            saved being in all existence, we may see what all others must be, or else
            not be saved. We ask then, where is the prototype? Or where is the saved
            being? We conclude as to the answer of this question there will be no dispute
            among those who believe the Bible, that it is Christ.
            All will agree in this that he is the prototype or standard of salvation, or in
            other words that he is a saved being. And if we should continue our interrogation,
            and ask how it is that he is
            saved, the answer would be because he is a just and holy being; and if
            he were anything different from what he is, he would not be saved; for
            his salvation depends on his being precisely what he is and nothing else;
            for if it were possible for him to change in the least
            degree, so sure he would fail of salvation and lose all his dominion,
            power, authority, and glory—which constitutes salvation; for salvation
            consists in the glory, authority, majesty, power, and dominion which Jehovah
            possesses, and in nothing else; and no being can possess it but himself
            or one like him. Thus says John in his first epistle, 3:2–3 “Behold, now
            we are the sons of God, and it doth not appear what we shall be: but we
            know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him: for we shall see
            him as he is. And any man that
            has this hope in him, purifies himself, even as he is pure.” Why purify
            himself as he is pure? Because, if they do not, they cannot be like him.

            The Lord said unto Moses, Leviticus 19:2 “Speak unto all the congregation
            of the children of Israel, and say unto them, Ye shall be holy: for I the Lord
            your God am holy.” And Peter says, first epistle 1:15–16 “But as he who
            has called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation; because
            it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.” And the
            Savior says, Matthew 5:48 “Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father
            who is in heaven is perfect.” If any should ask, Why all these sayings?
            the answer is to be found from what is before quoted from John’s epistle,
            that when he (the Lord) shall appear, the saints will be like him. And
            if they are not holy, as he is holy, and perfect as he is perfect, they
            cannot be like him; for no being can enjoy his glory without possessing
            his perfections and
            holiness, no more than they could reign in his kingdom without his power.

            This clearly sets forth the propriety of the Savior’s saying, recorded
            in John’s testimony, 14:12 “Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth
            on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these;
            because I go unto the Father.” This taken in connection with some of the
            sayings in the Savior’s prayer, recorded in the 17
        </span><superscript><span>th</span></superscript><span>
            chapter, gives great clearness to his expressions. He says, in John 17:20–24
            “Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also who shall believe on
            me through their words; that they all may be one; as thou, Father, art
            in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may
            believe that thou hast sent me. And the glory which thou gavest me I have
            given them; that they may be one, even as we are one: I in them, and thou
            in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know
            that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me. Father,
            I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am;
            that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst
            me before the foundation of the world.”

            All these sayings put together, give as clear an account of the state
            of the glorified saints as language could give. The works that Jesus had
            done they were to do, and greater works than those which he had done among
            them should they do, and that because he went to the Father. He does not
            say that they should do these works in time; but they should do greater
            works because he went to the Father. He says in the 24
        </span><superscript><span>th</span></superscript><span>
            verse: “Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with
            me where I am; that they may behold my glory.” These sayings taken in connection,
            make it very plain that the greater works,
            which those that believed on his name were to do, were to be done in eternity,
            where he is going and where they should behold his glory. He had said in
            another part of his prayer, that he desired of his Father that those who
            believed on him should be one in him, as he and the Father were one in
            each other. “Neither pray I for these [the apostles] alone, but for them
            also who shall believe on me through their words: that they all may be
            one.” That is, they who believe on him through the apostles’ words, as well
            as the apostles themselves, “That they all may be one; as thou, Father,
            art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us.”

            What language can be plainer than this? The Savior surely intended to
            be understood by his disciples. And he so spake that they might understand
            him, for he declares to his Father in language not to be easily mistaken,
            that he wanted his disciples, even all of them, to be as himself and the
            Father. For as he and the Father were one, so they might be one with them.
            And what is said in the 22
        </span><superscript><span>nd</span></superscript><span>
            verse is calculated to more firmly establish this belief, if it needs
            anything to establish it. He says, “And the glory which thou gavest me
            I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one.” As much as to say,
            that unless they have the glory which the Father had given him, they could
            not be one with them. For he
            says he had given them the glory that the Father had given him, that they
            might be one, or in other words, to make them one.

            This fills up the measure of information on this subject, and shows most
            clearly that the Savior wished his disciples to understand that they were
            to be partakers with him in all things—not even his glory excepted.

            It is scarcely necessary here to observe what we have previously noticed,
            that the glory which the Father and the Son have, is because they are just
            and holy beings. And that if they were lacking in one attribute or perfection
            which they have, the glory which they have never could be enjoyed by them;
            for it requires them to be precisely what they are in order to enjoy it;
            and if the Savior gives this glory to any others, he must do it in the
            very way set forth in his prayer to his Father by making them one with
            him, as he and the
            Father are one. In so doing he would give them the glory which the Father
            has given him; and when his disciples are made one with the Father and
            the Son, as the Father and the Son are one, who cannot see the propriety
            of the Savior’s saying, “The works which I do shall they do also; and greater
            works than these shall they do; because I go to the Father”?

            These teachings of the Savior most clearly show unto us the nature of
            salvation, and what he proposed unto the human family when he proposed
            to save them; that he
            proposed to make them like unto himself, and he was like the Father—the
            great prototype of all saved beings. And for any portion of the human family
            to be assimilated into their
            likeness is to be saved, and to be unlike them is to be destroyed. And
            on this hinge turns the door of salvation.

        <verse>17</verse><span>
            Who cannot see then, that salvation is the effect of faith? For as we
            have previously observed, all the heavenly beings work by this principle;
            and it is because they are able so to do that they are saved; for nothing
            but this could save them. And this is the lesson
            which the God of heaven, by the mouth of all his holy prophets, has been
            endeavoring to teach to the world. Hence, we are told that without faith
            it is impossible to please God and that salvation “is of faith, that it
            might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed”
            (Romans 4:16). And that Israel, who followed after the law of
            righteousness, has not attained to the law of righteousness. “Wherefore?
            Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the
            law. For they stumbled at that stumbling-stone.” (Romans 9:32). And Jesus
            said unto the man who brought his son to him, to get the devil who tormented
            him, cast out, “If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that
            believeth” (Mark 9:23). These with a multitude of other scriptures which
            might be quoted, plainly set forth the light in which the Savior, as well
            as the Former Day Saints, viewed the plan of salvation—that it was a system
            of faith—it begins
            with faith, and continues by faith; and every blessing which is obtained
            in relation to it, is the effect of faith, whether it pertains to this
            life or that which is to come. To this, all the revelations of God bear
            witness. If there were children of promise, they were the effects of faith;
            not even the Savior of the world excepted. “Blessed is she that believed,”
            said
            Elizabeth to Mary when she went to visit her, “for there shall be a performance
            of those things which were told her from the Lord” (Luke 1:45). Nor was
            the birth of John the Baptist the less a matter of faith; for in order
            that his father Zacharias might believe, he
            was struck dumb. And through the whole history of the scheme of life and
            salvation, it is a matter of faith: every man received according to his
            faith. According as his faith was, so
            were his blessings and privileges; and nothing was withheld from him when
            his faith was sufficient to receive it. He could stop the mouths of lions,
            quench the violence of fire, escape the edge of the sword, wax valiant
            in fight, and put to flight the armies of the
            aliens; women could by their faith receive their dead children to life
            again. In a word, there was nothing impossible with them who had faith.
            All things were in subjection to the Former Day Saints, according as their
            faith was. By their faith they could obtain
            heavenly visions, the ministering of angels, have knowledge of the spirits
            of just men made perfect, of the general assembly and church of the Firstborn
            whose names are written in heaven, of God the Judge of all, of Jesus the
            Mediator of the new covenant, and become
            familiar with the third heavens, see and hear things which were not only
            unutterable, but were unlawful to utter. Peter, in view of the power of
            faith, 2
        </span><superscript><span>nd</span></superscript><span>
            epistle, 1:1–3 says, to the Former Day Saints: “Grace and peace be multiplied
            unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord, according
            as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life
            and godliness, through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory
            and virtue.” In the first epistle 1:3–5 he says: “Blessed be the God and
            Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his abundant mercy has
            begotten us again unto a
            lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance
            incorruptible and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven
            for you, who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation
            ready to be revealed in the last time.”

            These sayings put together, show the apostle’s views most clearly, so
            as to admit of no mistake on the mind of any individual. He says that all
            things that pertain to life and godliness were given unto them through
            the knowledge of God and our Savior Jesus
            Christ. And if the question is asked, How were they to obtain the knowledge
            of God? (For there is a great difference between believing in God and knowing
            him; knowledge implies more than faith. And notice, that all things that
            pertain to life and godliness were given through the knowledge of God);
            the answer is given, Through faith they were to obtain this knowledge;
            and having power by faith to obtain the knowledge of God, they could
            with it obtain all other things which pertain to life and godliness.

            By these sayings of the apostle, we learn that it was by obtaining a knowledge
            of God that men got the knowledge of all things which pertain to life and
            godliness, and this knowledge was the effect of faith. So that all things
            which pertain to life and godliness are the effects of faith.

            From this we may extend as far as any circumstances may require, whether
            on earth or in heaven; and we will find it the testimony of all inspired
            men, or heavenly messengers, that all things that pertain to life and godliness
            are the effects of faith and nothing else. All
            learning, wisdom, and prudence fail; and everything else, as a means of
            salvation—but
            faith. This is the reason that the fishermen of Galilee could teach the
            world—because they sought by faith and by faith obtained. And this is the
            reason that Paul counted all things but filth and dross—what he formerly
            called his gain he called his loss; yea, and he counted “all things but
            loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus the Lord”
            (Philippians 3:710). Because to obtain the faith by which he could enjoy
            the knowledge of Christ Jesus the Lord, he had to suffer the loss of all
            things. This is the reason that the
            Former Day Saints knew more, and understood more of heaven and of heavenly
            things, than all others besides, because this information is the effect
            of faith—to be obtained by no other means. And this is the reason that
            men, as soon as they lose their faith, run into
            strifes, contentions, darkness and difficulties; for the knowledge which
            tends to life
            disappears with faith, but returns when faith returns; for when faith
            comes, it brings its
            train of attendants with it—apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors,
            teachers, gifts, wisdom, knowledge, miracles, healings, tongues, interpretation
            of tongues, etc. All these appear
            when faith appears on the earth, and disappear when it disappears from
            the earth. For these are the effects of faith and always have, and always
            will attend it. For where faith is, there will the knowledge of God be
            also, with all things which pertain thereto—
            revelations, visions, and dreams, as well as every other necessary thing
            in order that the possessors of faith may be perfected and obtain salvation;
            for God must change, otherwise faith will prevail with him. And he who
            possesses it will through it obtain all necessary knowledge and wisdom,
            until he shall know God and the Lord Jesus Christ whom he has sent—whom
            to know is eternal life.

                    BC: A preface or instruction unto the
                    Book Of Commandments, which were given of the Lord unto his
                    church, through him whom he appointed to this work, by the voice of his saints through the prayer of
                    faith. This church being organized according to the will of him who rules all things on the sixth day of
                    April, in the year of our Lord, one thousand eight hundred and thirty.

            Hearken, O ye people of my church, saith the voice of him who dwells on
            high, and whose eyes are upon all men; yea, verily I say: Hearken ye people
            from afar; and ye that
            are upon the islands of the sea, listen together.
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>
            For verily the voice of the Lord is unto all men, and there is none to
            escape; and there is no eye that shall not see, neither ear that shall
            not hear, neither heart that shall not be penetrated.
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>
            And the rebellious shall be
            pierced with much sorrow; for their iniquities shall be spoken upon the
            housetops, and their secret acts shall be revealed.

                    Working in Harmony, Pennsylvania, from mid-April to mid-June 1828, Joseph Smith dictated and
                    Martin Harris wrote what Joseph later called the Book of Lehi. Facing opposition from his wife, Martin
                    pressed Joseph to ask the Lord through the Urim and Thummim whether Martin could take the
                    translation to Palmyra to convince his friends and family. Joseph inquired of the Lord and the Lord said
                    that Martin must not take the manuscript. Dissatisfied with the answer, Martin made a second
                    request, resulting in a similar inquiry and answer. Martin persisted, and Joseph again asked, and
                    permission was granted on certain conditions, which included showing them only to specified family
                    members. Martin left for New York with the manuscript in mid-June. In early July, Joseph traveled to
                    Palmyra to learn the cause of Martin’s absence and silence. Shortly after arriving, he learned that
                    Martin had lost the manuscript. Joseph returned to Harmony in low spirits.

                    HC: Immediately after my return home I was walking out a little distance, when behold the former
                    heavenly messenger appeared and handed to me the Urim and Thummim again—for it had been taken
                    from me in consequence of my having wearied the Lord in asking for the privilege of letting Martin
                    Harris take the writings, which he lost by transgression—and I inquired of the Lord through it, and
                    obtained the following:

                    Shortly after receiving this revelation, Joseph Smith, Sr. returned to Palmyra where Oliver Cowdery was
                    boarding at his house. Lucy Smith wrote that although Cowdery had questioned Joseph Sr. about the
                    gold plates, he did not succeed in eliciting any information for a long time. This revelation likely motivated Joseph Sr. to share enough information with Oliver to prompt him to receive his own
                    manifestation through prayer and travel to Harmony to meet Joseph.

                    Joseph had not seen Martin since the summer of 1828 when Martin admitted to losing the 116 pages
                    of manuscript. Opponents were threatening a lawsuit claiming Joseph did not have the gold plates and
                    was defrauding believers. Martin desired of the Lord to know whether Joseph had in his possession,
                    the record of the Nephites.

            he shall say: “I have seen them, and they have been shown unto me by the
            power of God;” and these are the words which he shall say.
        </span><verse>27</verse><span>
            But if he deny this he will break the covenant which he has before covenanted
            with me, and behold, he is condemned.

            commandments, and exercise faith in me, behold, I say unto him, he shall
            have no such views, for I will grant unto him no views of the things of

            that he shall do no more, nor trouble me any more concerning this matter.

            humbleth not himself and receive a witness from my hand, that he will

            I have given unto thee these commandments.

            which I have commanded thee.
        </span><verse>35</verse><span>

                    Oliver Cowdery had previously boarded at Joseph Smith, Sr.’s house and heard about Joseph and the
                    gold plates. Oliver prayed about these things and the Lord manifested to him that they were true.
                    Oliver arrived in Harmony on April 7, 1829.

                    Book of Mormon, and he
                    began to write for me, which having continued for some time, I inquired of the Lord through the Urim
                    and Thummim, and obtained the following:

            A great and marvelous work is about to come forth unto the children of

            Behold, I am God; give heed unto my word, which is quick and powerful,
            sharper than a two- edged sword, to the dividing asunder of both joints
            and marrow; therefore give heed unto my words.

            Behold, the field is white already to harvest; therefore, whoso desireth

            Behold thou hast a gift, and blessed art thou because of thy gift. Remember
            it is sacred and cometh from above—
        </span><verse>11</verse><span>
            and if thou wilt inquire, thou shalt know mysteries which are great and
            marvelous; therefore thou shalt exercise thy gift, that thou mayest find

            Make not thy gift known unto any save it be those who are of thy faith.

            thou hast received instruction of

            Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God. I am the same that came unto
            mine own, and mine own

        </span><verse>23</verse><span>
            Did I not speak peace to your mind concerning the matter? What greater

            And now, behold, you have received a witness; for if I have told you things

            Verily, verily, I say unto you, that there are records which contain much
            of my gospel, which have been kept back because of the wickedness of the
            people;
        </span><verse>27</verse><span>
            and now I command you, that if you have good desires—a desire to lay up
            treasures for yourself in heaven—then shall you assist in bringing to light,
            with your gift, those parts of my
            scriptures which have been hidden because of iniquity.
        </span><verse>28</verse><span>
            And now, behold, I give unto you, and also unto my servant Joseph, the
            keys of this gift, which shall bring to light this ministry; and in the
            mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.

            Verily, verily, I say unto you, if they reject my words, and this part
            of my gospel and ministry, blessed are ye, for they can do no more unto
            you than unto me.
        </span><verse>30</verse><span>
            And even if they do unto you even as they have done unto me, blessed are
            ye, for you shall dwell with me in glory.
        </span><verse>31</verse><span>
            But if they reject not my words, which shall be established by the testimony
            which shall be given, blessed are they, and then shall ye have joy in the
            fruit of your labors.

        <verse>32</verse><span>
            Verily, verily, I say unto you, as I said unto my disciples, where two
            or three are
            gathered together in my name, as touching one thing, behold, there will
            I be in the midst of them—even so am I in the midst of you.
        </span><verse>33</verse><span>
            Fear not to do good, my sons, for whatsoever ye sow, that shall ye also
            reap; therefore, if ye sow good ye shall also reap good for your reward.
        </span><verse>34</verse><span>
            Therefore, fear not, little flock; do good; let earth and hell combine
            against you, for if ye are built upon my rock, they cannot prevail.

            Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not.

            Behold the wounds which pierced my side, and also the prints of the nails

                    HC: During the month of April I continued to translate, and he to write, with little cessation, during
                    which time we received several revelations. A difference of opinion arising between us about the
                    account of John the Apostle, mentioned in the New Testament, as to whether he died or continued to
                    live, we mutually agreed to settle it by the Urim and Thummim and the following is the word which we
                    received:

                    HC: Whilst continuing the work of translation, during the month of April, Oliver Cowdery became
                    exceedingly anxious to have power to translate bestowed upon him, and in relation to this desire the
                    following revelations were obtained:

            Oliver Cowdery, verily, verily, I say unto you, that assuredly as the
            Lord liveth, who is your God and your Redeemer, even so surely shall you
            receive a knowledge of whatsoever things you shall ask in faith, with an
            honest heart, believing that you shall receive a
            knowledge concerning the engravings of old records, which are ancient,
            which contain those parts of my scripture of which has been spoken by the
            manifestation of my Spirit.
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>
            Yea, behold, I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy
            Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart.

            Now, behold, this is the spirit of revelation; behold, this is the spirit
            by which Moses brought the children of Israel through the Red Sea on dry
            ground.
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>
            Therefore this is thy gift; apply unto it, and blessed art thou, for it
            shall deliver you out of the hands of your enemies, when, if it were not
            so, they would slay you and bring your soul to destruction.
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>

                Aaron

            behold, there is no other power, save
        </span><dunder><span>the power of</span></dunder><span>
            God, that can cause this

                Therefore, doubt not, for it is the gift of God;

                shall be able to
                take it away out of your hands,

            And, therefore, whatsoever you shall ask me to tell you by that means,
            that will I grant unto you, and you shall

            <bc><span>know</span></bc><span>

            Behold, I say unto you, my son, that because you did not translate according
            to that
            which you desired of me, and did commence again to write for my servant,
            Joseph Smith, Jr., even so I would that ye should continue until you have
            finished this record, which I have entrusted unto him.
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>
            And then, behold, other records have I, that I will give unto you power
            that you may assist to translate.

        <verse>3</verse><span>
            Be patient, my son, for it is wisdom in me, and it is not expedient that
            you should translate at this present time.
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>
            Behold, the work which you are called to do is to write for my servant
            Joseph.
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>
            And, behold, it is because that you did not continue as you
            commenced, when you began to translate, that I have taken away this privilege
            from you.

        </span><verse>7</verse><span>
            Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it
            unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me.
        </span><verse>8</verse><span>
            But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind;
            then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that
            your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is
            right.
        </span><verse>9</verse><span>
            But if it be not right you shall have no such feelings, but you shall
            have a stupor of thought that shall cause you to forget the thing which
            is wrong; therefore, you cannot write that which is sacred save it be given you from me.

            Behold, it was expedient when you commenced; but you feared, and the time
            is past, and it is not expedient now;
        </span><verse>12</verse><span>
            for, do you not behold that I have given unto my servant Joseph sufficient

            And now, verily I say unto you, that an account of those things that you

            of Nephi;
        </span><verse>39</verse><span>
            yea, and you remember it was said in those writings that a more particular
            account was given of these things upon the plates of Nephi.
        </span><verse>40</verse><span>
            And now, because the account which is engraven upon the plates of Nephi

            to the knowledge of the people in this account—
        </span><verse>41</verse><span>
            therefore, you shall
            translate the engravings which are on the plates of Nephi, down even till
            you come to the reign of king Benjamin, or until you come to that which
            you have translated, which you have retained;

            Behold, there are many things engraven upon the plates of Nephi which

            you should

                    HC: Feeling it to be our duty, we commenced to reason out of the scriptures with our acquaintances
                    and friends. About this time my brother Samuel H. Smith came to visit us. We informed him of what
                    the Lord was about to do for the children of men, and began to reason with him out of the Bible. We
                    also showed him that part of the work which we had translated, and labored to persuade him
                    concerning the Gospel of Jesus Christ, which was now about to be revealed in its fulness. He was not, however, very easily persuaded of these things, but after much inquiry and explanation he retired to
                    the woods, in order that by secret and fervent prayer he might obtain of a merciful God, wisdom to
                    enable him to judge for himself. The result was that he obtained revelation for himself sufficient to
                    convince him of the truth of our assertions to him; and on the twenty-fifth day of that same month in
                    which we had been baptized and ordained, Oliver Cowdery baptized him; and he returned to his
                    father’s house, greatly glorifying and praising God, being filled with the Holy Spirit.

                    My brother Hyrum Smith came to us to inquire concerning these things, when at his earnest request, I
                    inquired of the Lord through the Urim and Thummim, and received for him the following:

                    kindly and considerately brought us a quantity of provisions, in order that we might not be interrupted
                    in the work of translation by the want of such necessities of life…he several times brought us supplies,
                    a distance of at least thirty miles, which enabled us to continue the work when otherwise we must have relinquished it for a season. Being very anxious to know his duty as to this work, I inquired of the
                    Lord for him, and obtained the following:

                    found mentioned in the translation of the plates. While we were thus employed, praying and calling

                    us, he ordained us, saying:

            sins; and this shall never be taken again from the earth, until the sons
            of Levi do offer again an offering unto the Lord in righteousness.

                    HC: In the course of the work of translation, we ascertained that three special witnesses were to be
                    provided by the Lord, to whom He would grant that they should see the plates from which this work
                    should be translated and that these witnesses should bear record of the same…Almost immediately
                    after we had made this discovery, it occurred to Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, and…Martin
                    Harris…that they would have me inquire of the Lord to know if they might not obtain of his the
                    privilege to be these three special witnesses and finally they became so very solicitous, and urged me
                    so much to inquire that at length I complied; and through the Urim and Thummim, I obtained of the
                    Lord for them the following:

                    to organize themselves according to the revealed word before THE

                    was published in
                    March 1830.

                any one knowingly to partake of my flesh and blood unworthily when ye shall

                my flesh and blood ye shall forbid him nevertheless ye shall not cast him
                out from among you but ye shall minister unto him and shall pray for him
                unto the Father in my name and if it so be that he repents and is baptized
                in my name then shall ye receive him and shall minister unto him of my
                flesh and blood but if he repents not he shall not be numbered among my
                people that he may not destroy my people. For behold I know my sheep and
                they are
                numbered nevertheless ye shall not cast him out of your synagogues or
                your places of worship for unto such shall ye continue to minister for
                ye know not but what they will
                return and repent and come unto me with full purpose of heart and I shall
                heal them and ye shall be the means of bringing salvation unto them. Therefore
                keep these sayings which I have commanded you that ye come not under condemnation
                for wo unto him whom the Father condemneth.

            And now I speak unto the church:
        </span><break></break><span>
            Repent all ye ends of the earth and come unto me and be baptized in my
            name which is Jesus Christ and endure to the end and ye shall be saved.
            Behold Jesus Christ is the name which is given of the Father and there
            is none other name given whereby man can be saved. Therefore all men must
            take upon them the name which is given of the Father for
            in that name shall they be called at the last day. Therefore if they know
            not the name by which they are called they cannot have place in the kingdom
            of my Father.

            Behold ye must walk uprightly before me and sin not and if ye do walk
            uprightly before me and sin not my grace is sufficient for you that ye
            shall be lifted up at the last day.
            Behold I am Jesus Christ the Son of the living God I am the same which
            came unto my own and my own received me not. I am the light which shines
            in darkness and the
            darkness comprehends it not. These words are not of men nor of man but
            of me. Now
            remember the words of him who is the first and the last the light and
            the life of the world. And I Jesus Christ your Lord and your God and your
            Redeemer by the power of my
            Spirit hath spoken it.

                    HC: We now became anxious to have that promise realized to us, which the angel that conferred upon
                    us the Aaronic Priesthood had given us, viz., that provided we continued faithful, we should also have
                    the Melchizedek Priesthood, which holds the authority of the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy
                    Ghost. We had for some time made this matter a subject of humble prayer, and at length we got
                    together in the chamber of Mr. Whitmer's house, in order more particularly to seek of the Lord what
                    we now so earnestly desired; and here, to our unspeakable satisfaction, did we realize the truth of the
                    Savior's promise—"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened
                    unto you"—for we had not long been engaged in solemn and fervent prayer, when the word of the
                    Lord came unto us in the chamber, commanding us that I should ordain Oliver Cowdery to be an Elder
                    in the Church of Jesus Christ; and that he also should ordain me to the same office; and then to ordain
                    others, as it should be made known unto us from time to time.

                    We were, however, commanded to defer this our ordination until such times as it should be
                    practicable to have our brethren, who had been and who should be baptized, assembled together,
                    when we must have their sanction to our thus proceeding to ordain each other, and have them decide
                    by vote whether they were willing to accept us as spiritual teachers or not; when also we were
                    commanded to bless bread and break it with them, and to take wine, bless it, and drink it with them;
                    afterward proceed to ordain each other according to commandment; then call out such men as the
                    Spirit should dictate, and ordain them; and then attend to the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy
                    Ghost, upon all those whom we had previously baptized, doing all things in the name of the Lord.

            Now, behold, because of the thing which you,
        </span><dunder><span>my servant Oliver Cowdery</span></dunder><span>
            ,
            have desired to know of me, I give unto you these words:
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>
            Behold, I have manifested unto you, by my Spirit in many instances, that
            the things which you have written are true; wherefore you know that they
            are true.
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>
            And if you know that they are true, behold, I give unto you a
            commandment, that you rely upon the things which are written;
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>
            for in them are all things written concerning
        </span><dunder><span>the foundation of</span></dunder><span>
            my church, my gospel, and my rock.
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>

            <bc><span>and</span></bc><span>
                upon the foundation of

            Behold, the world is ripening in iniquity; and it must needs be that the

            the house of Israel.

            Wherefore, as thou hast been baptized by the hands of my servant

            ., according to that which I have commanded him, he hath fulfilled the

            And now, marvel not that I have called him unto mine own purpose, which

            commandments he shall be blessed unto eternal life; and his name is Joseph.

            And now, Oliver

        </span><dunder><span>Whitmer</span></dunder><span>
            ,
            by the way of commandment; for, behold, I command all men everywhere
            to repent, and I speak
            unto you, even as unto Paul mine apostle, for you are called even with
            that same calling with which he was called.
        </span><verse>10</verse><span>
            Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God;

                Redeemer
            </span>

            suffered death in the flesh; wherefore he suffered the pain of all men,
            that all men might repent and come unto him.
        </span><verse>12</verse><span>
            And he hath risen again from the dead, that he might bring all men unto
            him, on conditions of repentance.
        </span><verse>13</verse><span>
            And how great is his joy in the soul that repents!
        </span><verse>14</verse><span>
            Wherefore, you are called to cry
            repentance unto this people.
        </span><verse>15</verse><span>
            And if it so be that you should labor all your days in crying repentance
            unto this people, and bring, save it be one soul unto me, how great shall
            be your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father!
        </span><verse>16</verse><span>
            And now, if your joy will be great with one soul that you have brought
            unto me into the kingdom of my Father, how great will be your joy if you
            should bring many souls unto me!

            Behold, Jesus Christ is the name which is
            given of the Father, and there is none other name given whereby man can
            be saved;

            —having done this that I might subdue all things unto myself—
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>
            retaining all power, even to the destroying of Satan and his works at
            the end of the world, and the last great day of judgment, which I shall
            pass upon the inhabitants thereof,
        </span><dunder><span>judging</span></dunder><span>
            every man according to his works and the deeds which he hath done.
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>
            And surely every man must repent or suffer, for I, God, am endless.
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>
            Wherefore, I revoke not the judgments which I shall pass, but woes shall
            go forth, weeping, wailing and gnashing of teeth, yea, to those who are
            found on my left hand.

            Nevertheless, it is not written that there shall be no end to this torment,
            but it is written
        </span><italic><span>endless torment</span></italic><span>
            .
        </span><verse>7</verse><span>
            Again, it is written
        </span><italic><span>eternal damnation</span></italic><span>
            ; wherefore it is more express than other scriptures, that it might work
            upon the hearts of the children of men, altogether for
            my name’s glory.
        </span><verse>8</verse><span>
            Wherefore, I will explain unto you this mystery, for it is meet unto you
            to know even as mine apostles.
        </span><verse>9</verse><span>
            I speak unto you that are chosen in this thing, even as one,
            that you may enter into my rest.
        </span><verse>10</verse><span>
            For, behold, the mystery of godliness, how great is it! For, behold, I
            am endless, and the punishment which is given from my hand is endless punishment,
            for Endless is my name. Wherefore—
        </span><verse>11</verse><span>
            eternal punishment is God’s punishment.
        </span><verse>12</verse><span>
            Endless punishment is God’s punishment.

            repent, lest I smite you by the rod of my mouth, and by my wrath, and
            by my anger, and your sufferings be sore—how sore you know not, how exquisite
            you know not, yea, how hard to bear you know not.
        </span><verse>16</verse><span>
            For behold, I, God, have suffered these things for all, that they might
            not suffer if they would repent;
        </span><verse>17</verse><span>
            but if they would not repent they must
            suffer even as I;
        </span><verse>18</verse><span>
            which suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble
            because of pain, and to bleed at every pore,
        </span><dunder><span>and to suffer</span></dunder><span>
            both body and spirit—and would that I might not drink the bitter cup,
            and shrink—
        </span><verse>19</verse><span>
            nevertheless, glory be to the Father, and I partook and finished my preparations
            unto the children of men.

                    On June 9, 1830, at the first conference of the church following its formal organization, this document
                    was presented to the membership for approval. It was later published twice in The Evening and
                    Morning Star, and place immediately after the preface in the 1835

                    the following, by the spirit of prophecy and revelation which not only gave us much information, but
                    also pointed out to us the precise day upon which, according to His will and commandment, we should
                    proceed to organize His Church once more here upon the earth:

                    HC: Having opened the meeting by solemn prayer to our Heavenly Father, we proceeded, according to
                    previous commandment, to call on our brethren to know whether they accepted us as their teachers in
                    the things of the Kingdom of God, and whether they were satisfied that we should proceed and be
                    organized as a Church according to said commandment which we had received. To these several
                    propositions they consented by a unanimous vote. I then laid my hands upon Oliver Cowdery, and
                    ordained him an Elder of the "Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints;" after which, he ordained me
                    also to the office of an Elder of said Church. We then took bread, blessed it, and brake it with them;
                    also wine, blessed it, and drank it with them. We then laid our hands on each individual member of the
                    Church present, that they might receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, and be confirmed members of the
                    Church of Christ. The Holy Ghost was poured out upon us to a very great degree—some prophesied,
                    whilst we all praised the Lord, and rejoiced exceedingly. Whilst yet together, I received the following

                    seeking whom he might devour. Brother Hiram Page had in his possession a certain stone, by which he
                    had obtained certain “revelations” concerning the upbuilding of Zion, the order of the Church, etc., all
                    of which were entirely at variance with the order of God’s house, as laid down in the New Testament,
                    as well as in our late revelations…Finding that many, especially the Whitmer family and Oliver
                    Cowdery, were believing much in the things set forth by this stone, we thought best to inquire of the
                    Lord concerning so important a matter and…we received the following:

                    A revelation to six elders of the church and three members. They understood from Holy Writ that
                    the time had come that the people of God should see eye to eye, and they seeing somewhat different
                    upon the death of Adam (that is, his transgression), therefor they made it a subject of prayer and inquired of the Lord. And thus came the word of the Lord through Joseph the Seer.

            Listen to the voice of Jesus Christ, your Redeemer, the Great I Am, whose
            arm of mercy hath atoned for your sins;
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>
            who will gather his people even as a hen gathereth her chickens under
            her wings, even as many as will hearken to my voice and humble themselves
            before me, and call upon me in mighty prayer.

            Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, that at this time your sins are
            forgiven you,
            therefore ye receive these things; but remember to sin no more, lest perils
            shall come upon you.
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>
            Verily, I say unto you that ye are chosen out of the world to declare
            my gospel with the sound of rejoicing, as with the voice of a trump.
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>
            Lift up your hearts and be glad, for I am in your midst, and am your advocate
            with the Father; and it is his good will to give you the kingdom.

            And, as it is written—Whatsoever ye shall ask in faith, being united in

            And ye are called to bring to pass the gathering of mine elect; for mine
            elect hear my voice and harden not their hearts;
        </span><verse>8</verse><span>
            wherefore the decree hath gone forth from the Father that they shall be
            gathered in unto one place upon the face of this land, to prepare their
            hearts and be prepared in all things against the day when tribulation and
            desolation are sent forth upon the wicked.
        </span><verse>9</verse><span>
            For the hour is nigh and the day soon at hand when the earth is ripe;

        <verse>10</verse><span>
            For the hour is nigh, and that which was spoken by mine apostles must
            be fulfilled; for as they spoke so shall it come to pass;
        </span><verse>11</verse><span>
            for I will reveal myself from heaven with power and great glory, with
            all the hosts thereof, and dwell in righteousness with men on earth a thousand

            And again, verily, verily, I say unto you, and it hath gone forth in a
            firm decree, by the will of the Father, that mine apostles, the twelve
            which were with me in my ministry at Jerusalem, shall stand at my right
            hand at the day of my coming in a pillar of fire, being clothed with robes
            of righteousness, with crowns upon their heads, in glory even as I am,
            to judge the whole house of Israel, even as many as have loved me and kept
            my commandments, and none else.
        </span><verse>13</verse><span>
            For a trump shall sound both long and loud, even as
            upon Mount Sinai, and all the earth shall quake, and they shall come forth—yea,
            even the dead which died in me, to receive a crown of righteousness, and

            I will take
            vengeance upon the wicked, for they will not repent; for the cup of mine
            indignation is full; for behold, my blood shall not cleanse them if they

            Wherefore, I the Lord God will send forth flies upon the face of the earth,
            which shall take hold of the inhabitants thereof, and shall eat their flesh,
            and shall cause maggots to come in upon them;
        </span><verse>19</verse><span>
            and their tongues shall be stayed that they shall not utter against me;
            and their
            flesh shall fall from off their bones, and their eyes from their sockets;
        </span><verse>20</verse><span>
            and it shall come to pass that the beasts of the forest and the fowls
            of the air shall devour them up.
        </span><verse>21</verse><span>
            And the great and abominable church, which is the whore of all the earth,
            shall be cast down by
            devouring fire, according as it is spoken by the mouth of Ezekiel the
            prophet, who spoke of these things, which have not come to pass but surely must, as I live,

            And again, verily, verily, I say unto you that when the thousand years

            earth but for a little season;
        </span><verse>23</verse><span>
            and the end shall come, and the heaven and the earth shall be consumed
            and pass away, and there shall be a new heaven and a new earth.
        </span><verse>24</verse><span>
            For all old things shall pass away, and all things shall become new, even
            the heaven and the earth, and all the fulness thereof, both men and beasts,
            the fowls of the air, and the fishes of the sea;
        </span><verse>25</verse><span>
            and not one hair, neither mote, shall be lost, for it is the workmanship
            of mine hand.

        <verse>26</verse><span>
            But, behold, verily I say unto you, before the earth shall pass away,
            Michael, mine
            archangel, shall sound his trump, and then shall all the dead awake, for
            their graves shall be opened, and they shall come forth—yea, even all.
        </span><verse>27</verse><span>
            And the righteous shall be gathered on my right hand unto eternal life;
            and the wicked on my left hand will I be ashamed to own before the Father;
        </span><verse>28</verse><span>
            wherefore I will say unto them, “Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting
            fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.”
        </span><verse>29</verse><span>
            And now, behold, I say unto you, never at any time have I declared from
            mine own mouth that they should return, for where I am they cannot come,
            for they have no power.
        </span><verse>30</verse><span>
            But remember that all my
            judgments are not given unto men; and as the words have gone forth out
            of my mouth
            even so shall they be fulfilled, that the first shall be last, and that
            the last shall be first in all things whatsoever I have created by the
            word of my power, which is the power of my Spirit.
        </span>

    <block>
        <verse>31</verse><span>
            For by the power of my Spirit created I them; yea, all things both spiritual
            and temporal—
        </span><verse>32</verse><span>
            first spiritual, secondly temporal, which is the beginning of my work;
            and
            again, first temporal, and secondly spiritual, which is the last of my
            work—
        </span><verse>33</verse><span>
            speaking unto you that you may naturally understand; but unto myself my
            works have no end, neither beginning; but it is given unto you that ye

            Wherefore, verily I say unto you that all things unto me are spiritual,
            and not at any time have I given unto you a law which was temporal; neither
            any man, nor the children of men; neither Adam, your father, whom I created.
        </span><verse>35</verse><span>
            Behold, I gave unto him that he should be an agent unto himself; and I
            gave unto him commandment, but no temporal commandment gave I unto him,
            for my commandments are spiritual; they are not natural nor temporal, neither
            carnal nor sensual.

        <verse>36</verse><span>
            And it came to pass that Adam, being tempted of the devil—for, behold,
            the devil was before Adam, for he rebelled against me, saying, “Give me
            thine honor, which is my power;” and also a third part of the hosts of
            heaven turned he away from me because of their agency;
        </span><verse>37</verse><span>
            and they were thrust down, and thus came the devil and his angels;
        </span><verse>38</verse><span>
            and,
            behold, there is a place prepared for them from the beginning, which place
            is hell.
        </span><verse>39</verse><span>
            And it must needs be that the devil should tempt the children of men,
            or they could not be agents unto themselves; for if they never should have
            bitter they could not know the sweet—
        </span><verse>40</verse><span>
            wherefore, it came to pass that the devil tempted Adam, and he partook
            of the forbidden fruit and transgressed the commandment, wherein he became
            subject to the will of the
            devil, because he yielded unto temptation.
        </span><verse>41</verse><span>
            Wherefore, I, the Lord God, caused that he should be cast out from the
            Garden of Eden, from my presence, because of his
            transgression, wherein he became spiritually dead, which is the first
            death, even that same death which is the last death, which is spiritual,
            which shall be pronounced upon the
            wicked when I shall say, “Depart, ye cursed.”
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>42</verse><span>
            But, behold, I say unto you that I, the Lord God, gave unto Adam and unto
            his seed, that they should not die as to the temporal death, until I, the
            Lord God, should send forth angels to declare unto them repentance and
            redemption, through faith on the name of mine Only Begotten Son.

    <block>
        <verse>43</verse><span>
            And thus did I, the Lord God, appoint unto man the days of his probation—that
            by his natural death he might be raised in immortality unto eternal life,
            even as many as would
        </span><ddunder>
            <manuscript><span>believe on my name</span></manuscript><span>
                believe

            ;
        </span><verse>44</verse><span>
            and they that believe not unto eternal damnation; for they cannot be redeemed
            from their spiritual fall, because they repent not;
        </span><verse>45</verse><span>
            for they love darkness rather than light, and their deeds are evil, and
            they receive their wages of whom they list to obey.

    <block>
        <verse>46</verse><span>
            But behold, I say unto you, that little children are redeemed from the
            foundation of the world through mine Only Begotten;
        </span><verse>47</verse><span>
            wherefore, they cannot sin, for power is not given unto Satan to tempt
            little children, until they begin to become accountable before me;
        </span><verse>48</verse><span>
            for it is given unto them even as I will, according to mine own pleasure,

            And he that has no understanding, it remains in me to do according as

                    HC: At length our conference assembled. The subject of the stone previously mentioned was discussed,
                    and after considerable investigation, Brother Page, as well as the whole Church who were present,
                    renounced the said stone, and all things connected therewith, much to our mutual satisfaction and
                    happiness…Before we separated we received the following:

            But your mind has been on the things of the earth more than on the things
            of me, your Maker, and the ministry whereunto you have been called; and
            you have not given heed unto my Spirit, and to those who were set over
            you, but have been persuaded by those whom I have not commanded.
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>
            Wherefore, you are left to inquire for yourself at my hand, and ponder

            And your home shall be at your father’s house, until I give unto you further

                    Thomas Marsh lived in Massachusetts and first learned of Joseph Smith during a visit to Palmyra in
                    1829. He met with Martin Harris and Oliver Cowdery and returned home with the first sixteen printed
                    pages of the
                    Book of Mormon. After learning of the formal organization of the Church of Christ in April
                    1830, Marsh moved to Palmyra in September.

                    HC: At this time a great desire was manifested by several of the Elders respecting the remnants of the
                    house of Joseph, the Lamanites, residing in the west—knowing that the purposes of God were great
                    respecting that people, and hoping that the time had come when the promises of the Almighty in
                    regard to them were about to be accomplished, and that they would receive the Gospel, and enjoy its blessings. The desire being so great, it was agreed that we should inquire of the Lord respecting the
                    propriety of sending some Elders among them, which we accordingly did, and received the following:

            you, and you are called to preach my gospel as with the voice of a trump;

                    HC: The Lord greatly encouraged and strengthened the faith of His little flock, which had embraced the
                    fulness of the everlasting Gospel, as revealed to them in the
                    Book of Mormon, by giving some more
                    extended information upon the Scriptures, a translation of which had already commenced. Much
                    conjecture and conversations frequently occurred among the Saints, concerning the books mentioned,
                    and referred to, in various places in the Old and New Testaments, which were now nowhere to be
                    found. The common remark was, “They are lost books;” but it seems the Apostolic Church had some of
                    these writings, as Jude mentions or quotes the Prophecy of Enoch, the seventh from Adam. To the joy
                    of the little flock ... did the Lord reveal the following doings of olden times, from the prophecy of Enoch.

            Now, in the days of the apostles the law of circumcision was had among

            And it came to pass that there arose a great contention among the people
            concerning the law of circumcision, for the unbelieving husband was desirous

            law of Moses, which law was fulfilled.

            And it came to pass that the children, being brought up in subjection

            that their
            children might remain without circumcision; and that the tradition might

            power from on high;

            and from thence, whosoever I will shall go forth among all nations, and
            it shall be told them what they shall do; for I have a great work laid
            up in store, for Israel shall be saved, and I will lead them whithersoever
            I will, and no power shall stay my hand.

            And now, I give unto the church in these parts a commandment, that certain

            of the church;
        </span><verse>35</verse><span>
            and they shall look to the poor and the needy, and administer to their

            I have commanded them;
        </span><verse>36</verse><span>

            See that all things are preserved; and when men are endowed with power

            must needs be that the

            the labor of his hands, to
            prepare and accomplish the things which I have commanded.

                    HC: Not long after this conference of the 2nd of January closed, there was a man came to me by the
                    name of James Covel, who had been a Baptist minister for about forty years, and covenanted with the
                    Lord that he would obey any command that the Lord would give him through me, as His servant, and I
                    received the following:

            the light and the life of the world; a light which shineth in
            darkness and the darkness comprehendeth it not;
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>
            the same which came in the meridian of time unto mine own, and mine own
            received me not;
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>
            but to as many as received me, gave I power to become my sons; and even

            the baptism of fire and the

            And inasmuch as they do repent and receive the

                    HC: The branch of the Church in this part of the Lord’s vineyard…were striving to do the will of God, so
                    far as they knew it, though some strange notions and false spirits had crept in among them. With a
                    little caution and some wisdom, I soon assisted the brethren and sisters to overcome them. The plan of
                    “common stock,” which had existed in what was called “the family,” whose members generally had
                    embraced the everlasting Gospel, was readily abandoned for the more perfect law of the Lord; and the
                    false spirits were easily discerned and rejected by the light of revelation. The Lord gave unto the

            Hearken, O ye elders of my church, who have assembled yourselves together
            in my name, even Jesus Christ the Son of the living God, the Savior of
            the world; inasmuch as ye believe on my name and keep my commandments.
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>
            Again I say unto you, hearken and hear and obey the law which I shall
            give unto you.

            For verily I say, as ye have assembled yourselves together according to
            the commandment wherewith I commanded you, and
            are agreed as touching this one thing, and have asked

            Behold, verily I say unto you, I give unto you this first commandment,

            Joseph

            , and Sidney Rigdon.
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>
            And I give unto them a commandment that they shall go forth for a little
            season, and it shall be given by the power of the Spirit when they shall
            return.
        </span><verse>6</verse><span>
            And ye shall go forth in the power of my Spirit, preaching my gospel,
            two by two, in my name, lifting up your voices as with the sound of a trump,
            declaring my word like unto angels of God.
        </span><verse>7</verse><span>
            And ye shall go forth baptizing with water, saying, “Repent ye, repent
            ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.”
        </span><verse>8</verse><span>
            And from this place ye shall go forth into the regions westward; and inasmuch
            as ye shall find
        </span><under>
            <bc><span>my disciples</span></bc><span>
                them that will receive you
            </span>
        </under><span>
            ye shall build up my church in every region—
        </span><verse>9</verse><span>
            until the time shall come when it shall be revealed unto you
            from on high, when the city of the New Jerusalem shall be prepared, that
            ye may be gathered in one, that ye may be my people and I will be your
            God.

                    HC: A woman came making great pretensions of revealing commandments, laws, and other curious
                    matters; and almost every person has advocates for both theory and practice in the various notions
                    and projects of the age, it became necessary to inquire of the Lord, when I received the following:

            O hearken, ye elders of my church, and give ear to the words which I shall
            speak unto you.
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>
            For behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, that ye have received a commandment
            for a law unto my church, through him whom I have appointed unto you to
            receive commandments and revelations from my hand.
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>
            And this ye shall know assuredly—that there is none other appointed unto
            you to receive commandments and revelations until he be taken, if he abide
            in me.
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>
            But verily, verily, I say unto you, that none else shall be appointed
            unto this gift except it be through him; for if it be taken from him he
            shall not have power except to appoint another in his stead.
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>
            And this shall be a law unto you, that ye receive not the teachings of
            any that shall come before you as revelations or
            commandments;
        </span><verse>6</verse><span>
            and this I give unto you that you may not be deceived, that you may know
            they are not of me.
        </span><verse>7</verse><span>
            For verily I say unto you, that he that is ordained of me shall come in
            at the gate and be ordained as I have told you before, to teach those revelations
            which you have received and shall receive through him whom I have appointed.

            <bc><span>note with a pen / for my church</span></bc><span>

                ye shall become instructed in the law of my church, and be

            sanctified by that which ye have received,

            that
            inasmuch as ye do this, glory shall be added to the kingdom which ye have
            received. Inasmuch as ye do it not, it shall be taken, even that which

            And again, I say unto you, that if ye desire the mysteries of the kingdom,

            the work wherewith I have commanded him;
        </span><verse>14</verse><span>

            For the day cometh that the Lord shall utter his voice out of heaven;

            For verily I say unto you, that great things await you;
        </span><verse>63</verse><span>
            ye hear of wars in foreign lands; but, behold, I say unto you, they are
            nigh, even at your doors, and not many years hence ye shall hear of wars
            in your own lands.
        </span><verse>64</verse><span>
            Wherefore I, the Lord, have said, gather ye out
            from the eastern lands, assemble ye yourselves together ye elders of my
            church; go ye forth into the western countries, call upon the inhabitants
            to repent, and inasmuch as they do
            repent, build up churches unto me.
        </span><verse>65</verse><span>
            And with one heart and with one mind, gather up your riches that ye may
            purchase an inheritance which shall hereafter be appointed unto you.
        </span><verse>66</verse><span>
            And it shall be called the New Jerusalem, a land of peace, a city of refuge,
            a place of safety for the saints of the Most High God;
        </span><verse>67</verse><span>
            and the glory of the Lord shall be there, and the terror of the Lord also

            And it shall come to pass among the wicked, that every man that will not

        </span><verse>69</verse><span>
            And there shall be gathered

            that shall not be at war one with another.
        </span><verse>70</verse><span>
            And it shall be said among the wicked, “Let us not go up to battle against
            Zion, for the inhabitants of Zion are terrible; wherefore we cannot stand.”
        </span><verse>71</verse><span>
            And it shall come to pass that the righteous shall be gathered out from

            And now I say unto you, keep these things from going abroad unto the world
            until it is expedient in me, that ye may accomplish this work in the eyes
            of the people, and in the eyes of your enemies, that they may not know
            your works until ye have accomplished the thing which I have commanded

            that when they shall know it, that they may consider these things.

            For when the Lord shall appear he shall be terrible unto them, that fear
            may seize upon them, and they shall stand afar off and tremble.
        </span><verse>75</verse><span>
            And all nations shall be afraid because of the terror of the Lord, and

            Hearken, O ye people of my church; for verily I say unto you that these
            things were spoken unto you for your profit and learning.
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>
            But notwithstanding those things which are written, it always has been
            given to the elders of my church from the beginning, and ever shall be,
            to conduct all meetings as they are directed and guided by the Holy Spirit.

            meetings, which are held before the world.
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>
            Ye are also commanded not to cast anyone who belongeth to the church out
            of your sacrament meetings; nevertheless, if any have
            trespassed, let him not partake until he makes reconciliation.
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>
            And again I say unto you, ye shall not cast any out of your sacrament
            meetings who are earnestly seeking the kingdom—I speak this concerning
            those who are not of the church.
        </span><verse>6</verse><span>
            And again I say unto you, concerning your confirmation meetings, that
            if there be any that are not of the

            them out.

            do in all holiness of heart,
            walking uprightly before me, considering the end of your salvation, doing
            all things with prayer and thanksgiving, that ye may not be seduced by
            evil spirits, or doctrines of devils, or the commandments of men; for some
            are of men, and others of devils.

            Wherefore, beware lest ye are deceived; and that ye may not be deceived
            seek ye
            earnestly the best gifts, always remembering for what they are given;
        </span><verse>9</verse><span>
            for verily I say unto you, they are given for the benefit of those who
            love me and keep all my commandments, and him that seeketh so to do; that
            all may be benefited that seek or that ask of me, that ask and not for
            a sign that they may consume it upon their lusts.
        </span><verse>10</verse><span>
            And again, verily I say unto you, I would that ye should always remember,
            and always retain in your minds what those gifts are, that are given unto
            the church.
        </span><verse>11</verse><span>
            For all have not every gift given unto them; for there are many gifts,

                of administration, as it will be pleasing unto the same Lord, according as
                the Lord will, suiting his mercies according to the conditions of the children

        <dot>
            <verse>19</verse><span>

        <dot>
            <verse>22</verse><span>

            <verse>23</verse><span>

            And unto the bishop of the church, and unto such as God shall appoint

                    Shakers were right in some particulars of their faith. In order to have more perfect understanding on
                    the subject, I inquired of the Lord, and received the following:

            And my servant Leman shall be ordained unto this work, that he may reason

            And now come, saith the Lord, by the Spirit, unto the elders of his church,
            and let us reason together, that ye may understand;
        </span><verse>11</verse><span>
            let us reason even as a man reasons one with another face to face.
        </span><verse>12</verse><span>
            Now, when a man reasons he is understood of man, because he
            reasons as a man; even so will I, the Lord, reason with you that you may
            understand.

            Wherefore, I the Lord ask you this question—unto what were ye ordained?
        </span><verse>14</verse><span>
            To preach my gospel by the Spirit, even the Comforter which was sent forth
            to teach the truth.
        </span><verse>15</verse><span>
            And then received ye spirits which ye could not understand, and received
            them to be of God; and in this are ye justified?
        </span><verse>16</verse><span>
            Behold ye shall answer this question yourselves;
            nevertheless, I will be merciful unto you; he that is weak among you hereafter
            shall be made strong.
        </span>

    <block>
        <verse>17</verse><span>
            Verily I say unto you, he that is ordained of me and sent forth to preach
            the word of
            truth by the Comforter, in the Spirit of truth, doeth he preach it by
            the Spirit of truth or some other way?
        </span><verse>18</verse><span>
            And if it be by some other way it is not of God.
        </span><verse>19</verse><span>
            And again, he that
            receiveth the word of truth, doeth he receive it by the Spirit of truth
            or some other way?
        </span><verse>20</verse><span>
            If it be some other way it is not of God.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>21</verse><span>
            Therefore, why is it that ye cannot understand and know, that he that
            receiveth the word by the Spirit of truth receiveth it as it is preached
            by the Spirit of truth?
        </span><verse>22</verse><span>
            Wherefore, he that preacheth and he that receiveth, understand one another,
            and both are edified and rejoice together.
        </span><verse>23</verse><span>
            And that which doeth not edify is not of God, and is darkness.
        </span><verse>24</verse><span>
            That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth
            in
            God, receiveth more light; and that light grows brighter and brighter
            until the perfect day.

            And again, verily I say unto you, and I say it that you may know the truth,
            that you may chase darkness from among you;
        </span><verse>26</verse><span>
            he that is ordained of God and sent forth, the same is appointed to be
            the greatest, notwithstanding he is the least and the servant of all.
        </span><verse>27</verse><span>
            Wherefore, he is possessor of all things; for all things are subject unto
            him, both in
            heaven and on the earth, the life and the light, the Spirit and the power,
            sent forth by the will of the Father through Jesus Christ, his Son.
        </span><verse>28</verse><span>
            But no man is possessor of all things
            except he be purified and cleansed from all sin.
        </span><verse>29</verse><span>
            And if ye are purified and cleansed from all sin, ye shall ask whatsoever
            you will in the name of Jesus and it shall be done.
        </span><verse>30</verse><span>
            But know this, it shall be given you what you shall ask; and as ye are
            appointed to the head, the spirits shall be subject unto you.
        </span>

    <block>
        <verse>31</verse><span>
            Wherefore, it shall come to pass, that if you behold a spirit manifested
            that you cannot understand, and you receive not that spirit, ye shall ask
            of the Father in the name of Jesus; and if he give not unto you that spirit,
            then you may know that it is not of God.
        </span><verse>32</verse><span>
            And it shall be given unto you, power over that spirit; and you shall
            proclaim against that spirit with a loud voice that it is not of God—
        </span><verse>33</verse><span>
            not with railing accusation, that ye be not
            overcome, neither with boasting nor rejoicing, lest you be seized therewith.
        </span><verse>34</verse><span>
            He that
            receiveth of God, let him account it of God; and let him rejoice that
            he is accounted of God worthy to receive.

            and power to overcome all things which are not ordained of him—
        </span><verse>36</verse><span>
            and behold, verily I say unto you, blessed are you who are now hearing
            these words of mine from the mouth of my servant, for your sins are forgiven

            Let my servant Joseph Wakefield, in whom I am well pleased, and my servant

        </span><verse>38</verse><span>
            and also my servant John Corrill, or as many of my servants as are ordained

                    HC: Not long after the foregoing was received, the Saints from the State of New York began to come
                    on, and it seemed necessary to settle them; therefore at the solicitation of Bishop Partridge, I inquired,
                    and received the following:

            Hearken unto me, saith the Lord your God, and I will speak unto my servant
            Edward Partridge, and give unto him directions; for it must needs be that
            he receive directions
            how to organize this people.
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>
            For it must needs be that they be organized according to my laws; if otherwise,
            they will be cut off.

                    receive the money as it shall be laid before him according to the covenant and go and
                    obtain a deed or article of this land unto himself, for I have appoint him to receive these
                    things. And thus through him the properties of this church shall be covenanted unto me.

            a writing that shall secure unto him his portion, that he shall hold it,
        </span><ddunder>
            <manuscript><span>of the church</span></manuscript><span>
                even this right and this inheritance

            , until he transgresses and is not accounted worthy by the voice of the
            church, according to the laws and covenants of the church, to belong to

        </span><verse>5</verse><dunder>
            <span>
                And
                if he shall transgress and is not accounted worthy to belong to the church,
                he shall not
                have power to claim that portion which he has consecrated unto the bishop
                for the poor
                and needy of my church; therefore, he shall not retain the gift, but shall
                only have claim
                on that portion that is deeded unto him.
            </span>

        <verse>7</verse><span>
            And let that which belongs to this people be appointed unto this people.

            And the money which is left unto this people—let there be an agent appointed
            unto this people, to take the money to provide food and raiment, according
            to the wants of this people.
        </span><verse>9</verse><span>
            And let every

            that of another church.
        </span><verse>11</verse><span>
            Wherefore, if another church would receive money of this church, let them
            pay unto this church again according as they shall agree;
        </span><verse>12</verse><span>
            and this shall be done through the bishop or the agent, which shall be

    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>13</verse><span>
            And again, let the bishop appoint a storehouse unto this church; and let
            all things both in money and in meat, which are more than is needful for
            the wants of this people, be kept in the hands of the bishop.
        </span><verse>14</verse><span>
            And let him also reserve unto himself for his own wants, and for the wants
            of his family, as he shall be employed in doing this business.

            And thus I grant unto this people a privilege of organizing themselves
            according to my laws.
        </span><verse>16</verse><span>
            And I consecrate unto them this land for a little season, until I, the
            Lord, shall provide for them otherwise, and command them to go hence;
        </span><verse>17</verse><span>
            and the hour and the day is not given unto them, wherefore let them act
            upon this land as for years, and this shall
            turn unto them for their good.
        </span><verse>18</verse><span>
            Behold, this shall be an example unto my servant Edward Partridge, in
            other places, in all churches.
        </span><verse>19</verse><span>
            And whoso is found a faithful, a just, and a
            wise steward shall enter into the joy of his Lord, and shall inherit eternal

                        It was clearly evident that the Lord gave us power in proportion to the work to be done,
                        and strength according to the race set before us, and grace and help as our needs
                        required. Great harmony prevailed; several were ordained; faith was strengthened; and
                        humility, so necessary for the blessing of God to follow prayer, characterized the Saints.

                    Conference was opened by prayer and exhortation by Joseph Smith Jr. the Revelator.
                    After the business of the church was attended to according to the Covenants, The Lord
                    made manifest to Joseph that it was necessary that such of the elders as were
                    considered worthy, should be ordained to the high priesthood. The spirit of the Lord fell
                    upon Joseph in an unusual manner…After he had prophesied, he laid his hands upon
                    Lyman Wight to the High Priesthood after the holy order of God. And the Spirit fell upon
                    Lyman and he prophesied concerning the coming of Christ.

                    of June 1831, a conference was held at Kirtland, represented by all the again
                    saw the visible manifestations of the power of God as plain as could have been on the
                    day of Pentecost and here for the first time I saw the Melchisedec priesthood introduced
                    into the church of Jesus Christ as anciently; whereunto I was ordained under the hands
                    of Joseph Smith, and I then ordained Joseph and Sidney and sixteen others such as he
                    chose unto the same priesthood. The spirit of God was made manifest to the heeling of
                    the sick, casting out devils, speaking in unknown tongues, discerning of spirits, and
                    prophesying with mighty power, After the two days the conference broke up receiving
                    the revelation which appointed 28 elders their Mission to Missouri.

                    The Melchizedek priesthood was then for the first time introduced, and conferred on
                    several of the elders. In this chiefly consisted the endowment—it being a new order— and bestowed authority. However, some doubting took place among the elders, and
                    considerable conversation was held on the subject. The elders not fairly understanding
                    the nature of the endowments, it took some time to reconcile all their feelings.

                    Several were then selected by revelation, through President Smith, and ordained to the
                    High Priesthood after the order of the Son of God; which is after the order of
                    Melchizedek. This was the first occasion in which this priesthood had been revealed and
                    conferred upon the Elders in this dispensation, although the office of an Elder is the
                    same in a certain degree, but not in the fulness.

            and a spot for the temple is lying westward, upon a lot which is not far
            from the courthouse.
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>
            Wherefore, it is wisdom that the land should be purchased by the saints,
            and also every tract lying westward, even unto the line running directly
            between Jew and Gentile;
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>
            and also every tract bordering by the prairies, inasmuch as my disciples
            are enabled to buy lands. Behold, this is wisdom, that they may obtain
            it for an everlasting inheritance.
        </span>

    <block>
        <verse>6</verse><span>
            And let my servant Sidney Gilbert stand in the office to which I have
            appointed him, to receive moneys, to be an agent unto the church, to buy
            land in all the regions round about, inasmuch as can be done in righteousness,
            and as wisdom shall direct.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>7</verse><span>
            And let my servant Edward Partridge stand in the office to which I have
            appointed him, and divide unto the saints their inheritance, even as I
            have commanded; and also those
            whom he has appointed to assist him.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>8</verse><span>
            And again, verily I say unto you, let my servant Sidney Gilbert plant
            himself in this place, and establish a store, that he may sell goods without
            fraud, that he may obtain money to buy lands for the good of the saints,
            and that he may obtain whatsoever things the
            disciples may need to plant them in their inheritance.
        </span><verse>9</verse><span>
            And also let my servant Sidney
            Gilbert obtain a license—behold here is wisdom, and whoso readeth let
            him understand— that he may send goods also unto the people, even by whom
            he will as clerks employed in his service;
        </span><verse>10</verse><span>
            and thus provide for my saints, that my gospel may be preached unto those
            who sit in darkness and in the region and shadow of death.

    <block>
        <verse>11</verse><span>
            And again, verily I say unto you, let my servant William W. Phelps be
            planted in this place, and be established as a printer unto the church.
        </span><verse>12</verse><span>
            And lo, if the world receive his writings—behold here is wisdom—let him
            obtain whatsoever he can obtain in
            righteousness, for the good of the saints.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>13</verse><span>
            And let my servant Oliver Cowdery assist him, even as I have commanded,
            in
            whatsoever place I shall appoint unto him, to copy, and to correct, and
            select, that all things may be right before me, as it shall be proved by
            the Spirit through him.
        </span>

    <block>
        <verse>14</verse><span>
            And thus let those of whom I have spoken be planted in the land of Zion,
            as speedily as can be, with their families, to do those things even as
            I have spoken.
        </span><verse>15</verse><span>
            And now
            concerning the gathering—Let the bishop and the agent make preparations
            for those
            families which have been commanded to come to this land, as soon as possible,
            and plant them in their inheritance.
        </span><verse>16</verse><span>
            And unto the residue of both elders and members further
            directions shall be given hereafter. Even so.

                    HC: During this week the Colesville branch, referred to in the latter part of the last revelation [D&amp;C
                    57:15], and Sidney Rigdon, Sidney Gilbert and wife, and Elders Morley and Booth, arrived. I received
                    the following:

            Hearken, O ye elders of my church, and give ear to my word, and learn
            of me what I will concerning you, and also concerning this land unto which
            I have sent you.
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>
            For verily I say unto you, blessed is he that keepeth my commandments,
            whether in life or in death; and he that is faithful in tribulation, the
            reward of the same is greater in the kingdom of
            heaven.
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>
            Ye cannot behold with your natural eyes, for the present time, the design
            of your God concerning those things which shall come hereafter, and the
            glory which shall follow after much tribulation.
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>
            For after much tribulation come the blessings. Wherefore the day cometh
            that ye shall be crowned with much glory; the hour is not yet, but is nigh
            at hand.
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>
            Remember this, which I tell you before, that you may lay it to heart,
            and receive that
            which is to follow.
        </span><verse>6</verse><span>
            Behold, verily I say unto you, for this cause I have sent you—
        </span><dot>
            <span>
                that you might be obedient,
            </span>
        </dot>
        <dot>
            <span>
                and that your hearts might be prepared to bear testimony of the things
                which are to come;
            </span>
        </dot>
        <dot>
            <verse>7</verse><span>
                and also that you might be honored in laying the foundation, and in bearing
                record of the land upon which the Zion of God shall stand;
            </span>
        </dot>
        <dot>
            <verse>8</verse><span>
                and also that a feast of fat things might be prepared for the poor; yea,
                a feast of fat things, of wine on the lees well refined, that the earth
                may know that the mouths of the prophets shall not fail;
            </span><verse>9</verse><span>
                yea, a supper of the house of the Lord, well prepared, unto which all
                nations shall be invited.
            </span><verse>10</verse><span>
                First, the rich and the learned, the wise and the noble;
            </span><verse>11</verse><span>
                and after that cometh the day of my power; then shall the poor, the lame,
                and the blind, and the deaf, come in unto the marriage of the Lamb, and
                partake of the
                supper of the Lord, prepared for the great day to come.
            </span><verse>12</verse><span>
                Behold, I, the Lord, have spoken it.

        </dot>
        <dot>
            <verse>13</verse><span>
                And that the testimony might go forth from Zion, yea, from the mouth of
                the city of the heritage of God.

        <verse>14</verse><span>
            Yea, for this cause I have sent you hither, and have selected my servant
            Edward
            Partridge, and have appointed unto him his mission in this land.
        </span><verse>15</verse><span>
            But if he repent not of his sins, which are unbelief and blindness of
            heart, let him take heed lest he fall.
        </span><verse>16</verse><span>
            Behold his mission is given unto him, and it shall not be given again.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>17</verse><span>
            And whoso standeth in this mission is appointed to be a judge in Israel,
            like as it was in ancient days, to divide the lands of the heritage of
            God unto his children;
        </span><verse>18</verse><span>
            and to judge his people by the testimony of the just, and by the assistance
            of his counselors, according to the laws of the kingdom which are given
            by the prophets of God.
        </span><verse>19</verse><span>
            For verily I say unto you, my law shall be kept on this land.
        </span><verse>20</verse><span>
            Let no man think he is ruler; but let God rule him
            that judgeth, according to the counsel of his own will, or, in other words,
            him that counseleth or sitteth upon the judgment seat.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>21</verse><span>
            Let no man break the laws of the land, for he that keepeth the laws of
            God hath no need to break the laws of the land.
        </span><verse>22</verse><span>
            Wherefore, be subject to the powers that be, until he reigns whose right
            it is to reign, and subdues all enemies under his feet.
        </span><verse>23</verse><span>
            Behold, the laws which ye have received from my hand are the laws of the
            church, and in this light ye shall hold them forth. Behold, here is wisdom.

    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>24</verse><span>
            And now, as I spake concerning my servant Edward
        </span><dunder>
            <span>
                Partridge
            </span>
        </dunder><span>
            , this land is the land of his residence, and those whom he has appointed
            for his counselors; and also the land of the
            residence of him whom I have appointed to keep my storehouse;
        </span><verse>25</verse><span>
            wherefore, let them bring their families to this land, as they shall counsel
            between themselves and me.
        </span><verse>26</verse><span>
            For behold, it is not meet that I should command in all things; for he
            that is compelled in all things, the same is a slothful and not a wise
            servant; wherefore he receiveth no reward.
        </span><verse>27</verse><span>
            Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do
            many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness;
        </span><verse>28</verse><span>
            for the power is in them,
            wherein they are agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men do good they
            shall in nowise lose their reward.
        </span><verse>29</verse><span>
            But he that doeth not anything until he is commanded, and
            receiveth a commandment with doubtful heart, and keepeth it with slothfulness,
            the same is damned.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>30</verse><span>
            Who am I that made man, saith the Lord, that will hold him guiltless that
            obeys not my commandments?
        </span><verse>31</verse><span>
            Who am I, saith the Lord, that have promised and have not fulfilled?
        </span><verse>32</verse><span>
            I command and men obey not; I revoke and they receive not the blessing.
        </span><verse>33</verse><span>
            Then they say in their hearts, “This is not the work of the Lord, for
            his promises are not fulfilled.” But wo unto such, for their reward lurketh
            beneath, and not from above.

        <verse>35</verse><span>
            It is wisdom in me that my servant Martin Harris should be an example
            unto the church, in laying his moneys before the bishop of the church.
        </span><verse>36</verse><span>
            And also, this is a law unto every man that cometh unto this land to receive
            an inheritance; and he shall do with his moneys according as the law directs.
        </span><verse>37</verse><span>
            And it is wisdom also that there should be lands purchased in Independence,
            for the place of the storehouse, and also for the house of the printing.
        </span><verse>38</verse><span>
            And other directions concerning my servant Martin
        </span><dunder>
            <span>
                Harris
            </span>
        </dunder><span>
            shall be given him of the
            Spirit, that he may receive his inheritance as seemeth him good;
        </span><verse>39</verse><span>
            and let him repent of his sins, for he seeks the praise of the world.

            And also let my servant William W. Phelps stand in the office to which
            I have appointed him, and receive his inheritance in the land;
        </span><verse>41</verse><span>
            and also he hath need to repent, for I, the Lord, am not

                well
            </span>
        </dunder><span>
            pleased with him, for he seeketh to excel, and he is not sufficiently
            meek before me.
        </span><verse>42</verse><span>
            Behold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I,
            the Lord, remember them no more.
        </span><verse>43</verse><span>
            By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins— behold, he will confess

            And now, verily, I say concerning the residue of the elders of my church,
            the time has not yet come, for many years, for them to receive their inheritance
            in this land, except they desire it through
        </span><dunder>

                the
            </span>

            prayer
        </span><dunder>
            <span>
                of faith
            </span>
        </dunder><span>
            , only as it shall be appointed unto them of the Lord.
        </span><verse>45</verse><span>
            For, behold, they shall push the people together from the ends of the
            earth.
        </span><verse>46</verse><span>
            Wherefore, assemble yourselves together; and they who are not appointed
            to stay in this land, let them preach the gospel in the regions round about;
            and after that let them return to their homes.
        </span><verse>47</verse><span>
            Let them preach by the way, and bear testimony of the truth in all places,
            and call upon the rich, the high and the low, and the poor to repent.
        </span><verse>48</verse><span>
            And let them build up churches, inasmuch as the inhabitants of the earth
            will repent.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>49</verse><span>
            And let there be an agent appointed by the voice of the church, unto the
            church in Ohio, to receive moneys to purchase lands in Zion.

    <block>
        <verse>50</verse><span>
            And I give unto my servant Sidney Rigdon a commandment, that he shall
            write a
            description of the land of Zion, and a statement of the will of God, as
            it shall be made known by the Spirit unto him;
        </span><verse>51</verse><span>
            and an epistle and subscription, to be presented unto all the churches
            to obtain moneys, to be put into the hands of the bishop, of himself or
            the agent, as seemeth him good or as he shall direct, to purchase lands
            for an inheritance for the children of God.
        </span><verse>52</verse><span>
            For, behold, verily I say unto you, the Lord willeth that the
            disciples and the children of men should open their hearts, even to purchase
            this whole
            region of country, as soon as time will permit.
        </span><verse>53</verse><span>
            Behold, here is wisdom. Let them do this lest they receive none inheritance,
            save it be by the shedding of blood.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>54</verse><span>
            And again, inasmuch as there is land obtained, let there be workmen sent
            forth of all kinds unto this land, to labor for the saints of God.
        </span><verse>55</verse><span>
            Let all these things be done in order; and let the privileges of the lands
            be made known from time to time, by the bishop or the agent of the church.
        </span><verse>56</verse><span>
            And let the work of the gathering be not in haste, nor by flight; but
            let it be done as it shall be counseled by the elders of the church at

            I, Sidney, a servant of Jesus Christ by the will of God the Father and
            through the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ unto the Saints who are scattered
            abroad in the last days, may grace, mercy and peace, rest upon you from
            God the Father and from our Lord Jesus Christ,
            who is greatly to be feared, among his Saints and to be had in reverence
            of all them who obey him.

            Beloved Brethren,
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <span>
            It has pleased God even the Father to make known unto us in these last
            days, the good
            pleasure of his will concerning his Saints; and to make known unto us,
            the things which he has decreed upon the nations even wasting and destruction.
            Until they are utterly
            destroyed, and the earth made desolate by reason of the wickedness of
            its inhabitants according as he has made known in times past by the prophets
            and apostles, that such calamities should befall the inhabitants of the
            earth in the last days, unless they should repent and turn to the living
            God. And as the time is now near at hand, for the
            accomplishment of his purposes and the fulfillment of his prophecies,
            which have been spoken by all the holy prophets ever since the world began,
            he has sent and signified, unto us by the mouths of his holy prophets,
            that he has raised up in these last days—the speedy accomplishment of his
            purposes which shall be accomplished, on the heads of the
            rebellious of this generation—among whom he has been pleased in much mercy
            and goodness to send forth the fullness of his gospel in order that they
            might repent and turn to the living God, and be made partakers of his Holy
            Spirit. But by reason of their
            wickedness and rebellion against him, and wicked and unbelieving hearts
            the Lord withdrew his spirit from them, and gives them up to work all uncleanliness
            with
            greediness, and to bring swift destruction on themselves--and through
            their wickedness to hasten the day of calamity, that they may be left without
            excuse in the day of vengeance.

            But it has pleased our Heavenly Father to make known some better things,
            concerning his Saints, and those who serve him in fear and rejoice in meekness
            before him, even things
            which pertain to life everlasting, for godliness has the promise of the
            life, that now is, and that which is to come; Even so it has pleased our
            Heavenly Father to make provisions for his Saints in these last days of
            tribulation that they through faith and patience, and by continuing in
            well-doing may preserve their lives; and attain unto rest and endless felicity-
            -but by no other means, than that of a strict observance of his commandments
            and
            teachings in all things as there is and can be no ruler or lawgiver in
            the kingdom of God save it be God our Savior himself—and before him he
            requires that all his saints and those who have named the name of Jesus,
            should be careful to depart from iniquity—and serve him with fear, rejoicing
            and trembling, least he be angry and they perish from their way.
        </span>

    <block>
        <span>
            According to the prediction of the ancient prophets that the Lord would
            send his messengers in the last days, and gather his elect (which is the
            elect according to the covenant, viz., those who like Abraham are faithful
            to God and the word of his grace) from the four winds even from one end
            of the earth to the other as testified of by the
            Savior himself—so in these last days, he has commenced to gather together,
            into a place provided before of God and had in reserve in days of old being
            kept by the power and providence of God, for this purpose and which he
            now holds in his own hands, that they through faith, and patience may inherit
            the promises—a land which God by his own commandment has consecrated to
            himself where he has said that his laws shall be kept, and where his saints
            can dwell in safety, through their perseverance in well-doing, and their
            unfeigned repentance of all their sins, our Heavenly Father has provided
            this land himself because it was the one which was the best adapted for
            his children, where Jew and Gentile might dwell together: for God has the
            same respect to all those who call upon him
            in truth and righteousness whether they be Jew and Gentile; for there
            is no respect of person with him.

            This land being situated in the center of the continent on which we dwell
            with an exceeding fertile soil and ready cleared for the hand of the cultivator
            bespeaks the
            goodness of our God, in providing so goodly a heritage, and its climate
            suited for persons from every quarter of this continent, either East, West,
            North and South. Yea I think I may say, for all constitutions from any
            portion the world, and its productions nearly all
            varieties of both grain and vegetables which are common in this country,
            together with all means, clothing: in addition to this it abounds with
            fountains of pure water, the soil
            climate at surface are all adapted, to health indeed I may say that the
            whole properties of the country invite the Saints to come, and partake
            of their blessings, but what more need I say about a country which our
            Heavenly Father holds in his hands, for if it were unhealthy he could make
            it healthy and if barren he could make it fruitful. Such is the land which
            the Lord has provided for us, in the last days for an inheritance, and
            truly it is a goodly
            land, and none other as well suited for all the Saints as this and all
            those who have faith and confidence in God who has ever seen this land
            will bear the same testimony. In order that you may understand the will
            of God respecting this land and the way and means of possessing it, I can
            only refer you to commandments which the Lord has delivered by the mouth
            of his prophets which will be read, to you, by our brethren Oliver Cowdery
            and Newel K. Whitney whom the Lord has appointed, to visit the Churches
            and obtain means for purchasing this our inheritance that we may escape
            in the day of tribulation which is coming on the earth. I conclude by exhorting
            you to hear the voice of the Lord your God who is speaking to you in much
            mercy and who is sending forth, his word and his
            revelation in these last days, in order that we may escape impending vengeance;
            and the judgments which await this generation, and which will speedily
            overtake them—brethren pray for me, that I may be counted worthy to obtain
            an inheritance in the land of Zion and to overcome, the World through faith,
            and dwell with the sanctified, forever, and
            ever Amen.

                    On the 2nd day of August 1831, Brother Sidney Rigdon stood up and asked saying: Do you receive this
                    land for the land of your inheritance with thankful hearts from the Lord? Answer from all: We do.

                    After prayer he arose and said: I now pronounce this land consecrated and dedicated to the Lord for a
                    possession and inheritance for the Saints (in the name of Jesus Christ having authority from him.) And
                    for all the faithful servants of the Lord to the remotest ages of time.

                    The day following, eight elders, viz., Joseph Smith, Jr., Oliver Cowdery, Sidney Rigdon, Peter Whitmer,
                    Frederick G. Williams, William W. Phelps, Martin Harris, and Joseph Coe, assembled together where
                    the temple is to be erected. Sidney Rigdon dedicated the ground where the city is to stand, and Joseph
                    Smith, Jr., laid a stone at the northeast corner of the contemplated temple in the name of the Lord
                    Jesus of Nazareth. After all present had rendered thanks to the great ruler of the universe, Sidney
                    Rigdon pronounced this spot of ground wholly dedicated unto the Lord forever, Amen.

                    William Phelps wrote in a July 1831 letter that Jackson County residents were “emigrants from
                    Tennessee, Kentucky, Virginia, and the Carolinas, &amp;c., with customs, manners, modes of living and a
                    climate entirely different from the northerners.” Joseph Smith later characterized many of the
                    residents as “the basest of men” who “had fled from the face of civilized society, to the frontier
                    country to escape the hand of justice, in their midnight revels, their sabbath breaking, horseracing, and
                    gambling.” A traveler to western Missouri in 1833 made a similar observation, stating that “the only
                    indications of its being Sunday” in the area was “the unusual gambling &amp; noise, &amp; assemblies around
                    taverns.”

            And it pleaseth God that he hath given all these things unto man; for
            unto this end were they made to be used, with judgment, not to excess,
            neither by extortion.

        <verse>1</verse><span>
            Behold, thus saith the Lord unto the elders of his church, who are to
            return speedily to the land from whence they came: Behold, it pleaseth
            me, that you have come up hither;
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>
            but with some I am not well pleased, for they will not open their mouths,
            but they hide the talent which I have given unto them, because of the fear
            of man. Wo unto such, for mine anger is kindled against them.
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>
            And it shall come to pass, if they are not more
            faithful unto me, it shall be taken away, even that which they have.
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>
            For I, the Lord, rule in the heavens above, and among the armies of the
            earth; and in the day when I shall make up my jewels, all men shall know
            what it is that bespeaketh the power of God.

        <verse>5</verse><span>
            But, verily, I will speak unto you concerning your journey unto the land
            from whence you came. Let there be a craft made, or bought, as seemeth
            you good, it mattereth not
            unto me, and take your journey speedily for the place which is called
            St. Louis.
        </span><verse>6</verse><span>
            And from thence let my servants, Sidney Rigdon, Joseph
        </span><dunder>

                Smith, Jun.

            , and Oliver Cowdery, take their journey for Cincinnati;
        </span><verse>7</verse><span>
            and in this place let them lift up their voice and declare my word with
            loud voices, without wrath or doubting, lifting up holy hands upon them.
            For I am able to make you holy, and your sins are forgiven you.

            preach the word, not in haste, among the congregations of the wicked, until
            they return to the churches
            from whence they came.
        </span><verse>9</verse><span>
            And all this for the good of the churches; for this intent have I sent

        <verse>10</verse><span>
            And let my servant Edward Partridge impart of the money which I have given
            him, a portion unto mine elders who are commanded to return;
        </span><verse>11</verse><span>
            and he that is able, let him
            return it by the way of the agent; and he that is not, of him it is not

            And now I speak of the residue who are to come unto this land.

            Behold, they have been sent to preach my gospel among the congregations
            of the wicked; wherefore, I give unto them a commandment, thus: Thou shalt
            not idle away thy time, neither shalt thou bury thy talent that it may
            not be known.
        </span><verse>14</verse><span>

            of the wicked, not in haste, neither in wrath nor with strife.
        </span><verse>15</verse><span>
            And shake off the dust of thy feet against those who receive thee not,
            not in their presence, lest thou provoke them, but in secret; and wash
            thy feet, as a testimony against them in the day of judgment.
        </span><verse>16</verse><span>
            Behold, this is sufficient for you, and the will of him who hath sent
            you.

                    HC: I left Independence for Kirtland. We started down the river in canoes…nothing important occurred
                    until the third day, when many of the dangers so common upon the western waters manifested
                    themselves; and after we had encamped upon the banks of the river…Brother Phelps, in open vision by
                    daylight, saw the destroyer in his most horrible power, ride upon the face of the waters; others heard
                    the noise, but saw not the vision. The next morning after prayer, I received the following:

            Behold, and hearken unto the voice of him who has all power, who is from
            everlasting to everlasting, even Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the
            end.
        </span>

        <verse>2</verse><span>
            Behold, verily thus saith the Lord unto you, O ye elders of my church,
            who are assembled upon this spot, whose sins are now forgiven you, for
            I, the Lord, forgive sins, and am merciful unto those who confess their
            sins with humble hearts;
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>
            but verily I say unto you, that it is not needful for this whole company
            of mine elders to be moving
            swiftly upon the waters, whilst the inhabitants on either side are perishing
            in unbelief.
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>
            Nevertheless, I suffered it that ye might bear record; behold, there are
            many dangers upon the waters, and more especially hereafter;
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>
            for I, the Lord, have decreed in mine anger many destructions upon the
            waters; yea, and especially upon these waters.
        </span><verse>6</verse><span>
            Nevertheless, all flesh is in mine hand, and he that is faithful among
            you shall not perish by the waters.

            Wherefore, it is expedient that my servant Sidney Gilbert and my servant
            William W.
            Phelps be in haste upon their errand and mission.
        </span><verse>8</verse><span>
            Nevertheless, I would not suffer that ye should part until you were chastened
            for all your sins, that you might be one, that you might not perish in
            wickedness;
        </span><verse>9</verse><span>
            but now, verily I say, it behooveth me that ye should part. Wherefore

            take their former company, and let them take their journey in haste that
            they may fill their mission, and through faith they shall overcome;
        </span><verse>10</verse><span>
            and inasmuch as they are faithful they shall be
            preserved, and I, the Lord, will be with them.
        </span><verse>11</verse><span>
            And let the residue take that which is needful for clothing.
        </span><verse>12</verse><span>
            Let my servant Sidney

                Gilbert
            </span>
        </dunder><span>
            take that which is not needful with him, as you shall agree.

            And now, behold, for your good I gave unto you a commandment concerning
            these things; and I, the Lord, will reason with you as with men in days
            of old.
        </span><verse>14</verse><span>
            Behold, I, the Lord, in the beginning blessed the waters; but in the last
            days, by the mouth of my servant John, I cursed the waters.
        </span><verse>15</verse><span>
            Wherefore, the days will come that no flesh shall be safe upon the waters.
        </span><verse>16</verse><span>
            And it shall be said in days to come that none is able to go up to the
            land of Zion upon the waters, but he that is upright in heart.
        </span><verse>17</verse><span>
            And, as I, the Lord, in the beginning cursed the land, even so in the
            last days have I blessed it, in its time, for the use of my saints, that
            they may partake the fatness thereof.

    <block>
        <verse>18</verse><span>
            And now I give unto you a commandment that what I say unto one I say unto
            all, that you shall forewarn your brethren concerning these waters, that
            they come not in
            journeying upon them, lest their faith fail and they are caught in snares;
        </span><verse>19</verse><span>
            I, the Lord, have decreed, and the destroyer rideth upon the face thereof,
            and I revoke not the decree.
        </span><verse>20</verse><span>
            I, the Lord, was angry with you yesterday, but today mine anger is turned
            away.
        </span><verse>21</verse><span>
            Wherefore, let those concerning whom I have spoken, that should take their
            journey in haste—again I say unto you, let them take their journey in haste.
        </span><verse>22</verse><span>
            And it mattereth not unto me, after a little, if it so be that they fill
            their mission, whether they go by water or
            by land; let this be as it is made known unto them according to their
            judgments hereafter.

            And now, concerning my servants, Sidney Rigdon, Joseph

            </span>

            , and Oliver Cowdery, let them come not again upon the waters, save it
            be upon the canal, while journeying unto their homes; or in other words
            they shall not come upon the waters to journey, save upon the canal.
        </span><verse>24</verse><span>
            Behold, I, the Lord, have appointed a way for the
            journeying of my saints; and behold, this is the way—that after they leave
            the canal they shall journey by land, inasmuch as they are commanded to
            journey and go up unto the
            land of Zion;
        </span><verse>25</verse><span>
            and they shall do like unto the children of Israel, pitching their tents

        <verse>26</verse><span>
            And, behold, this commandment you shall give unto all your brethren.
        </span><verse>27</verse><span>
            Nevertheless,
            unto whom is given power to command the waters, unto him it is given by
            the Spirit to know all his ways;
        </span><verse>28</verse><span>
            wherefore, let him do as the Spirit of the living God commandeth him,
            whether upon the land or upon the waters, as it remaineth with me to do
            hereafter.
        </span><verse>29</verse><span>
            And unto you is given the course for the saints, or the way for the saints
            of the camp of the Lord, to journey.

            they arrive at Cincinnati;
        </span><verse>31</verse><span>
            and in that place they shall lift up their voices unto God against that
            people, yea, unto him whose anger is kindled against their wickedness,
            a people who are well-nigh ripened for destruction.
        </span><verse>32</verse><span>
            And from thence let them journey for the
            congregations of their brethren, for their labors even now are wanted
            more abundantly among them than among the congregations of the wicked.

                    HC: In these infant days of the Church, there was a great anxiety to obtain the word of the Lord upon
                    every subject that in any way concerned our salvation; and as the land of Zion was now the most
                    important temporal object in view, I inquired of the Lord for further information upon the gathering of
                    the Saints, and the purchase of the land, and other matters, and received the following:

            Hearken, O ye people, and open your hearts and give ear from afar; and
            listen, you that call yourselves the people of the Lord, and hear the word
            of the Lord and his will
            concerning you.
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>
            Yea, verily, I say, hear the word of him whose anger is kindled against
            the wicked and rebellious;
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>
            who willeth to take even them whom he will take, and
            preserveth in life them whom he will preserve;
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>
            who buildeth up at his own will and

            Wherefore, verily I say, let the wicked take heed, and let the rebellious
            fear and tremble; and let the unbelieving hold their lips, for the day
            of wrath shall come upon them as a whirlwind, and all flesh shall know

            Verily, I say unto you, there are those among you who seek signs, and
            there have been such even from the beginning;
        </span><verse>9</verse><span>
            but, behold, faith cometh not by signs, but signs follow those that believe.

            Yea, signs come by faith, not by the will of men, nor as they please,
            but by the will of God.
        </span><verse>11</verse><span>
            Yea, signs come by faith, unto mighty works, for without faith no man
            pleaseth God; and with whom God is angry he is not well pleased; wherefore,
            unto such he showeth no signs, only in wrath unto their condemnation.

            Wherefore, I, the Lord, am
            not pleased with those among you who have sought after signs and wonders

            Nevertheless, I give commandments, and many have turned away from my commandments

        </span><verse>14</verse><span>
            There were among you adulterers and
            adulteresses; some of whom have turned away from you, and others remain
            with you that hereafter shall be revealed.
        </span><verse>15</verse><span>
            Let such beware and repent speedily, lest judgment shall come upon them
            as a snare, and their folly shall be made manifest, and their works shall
            follow them in the eyes of the people.

            Nevertheless, he that endureth in faith and doeth my will, the same shall

            Wherefore, the land of Zion shall not be obtained but by

            And if by purchase, behold you are blessed;

            The country is unlike the timbered states of the East. As far as the eye
            can reach the beautiful rolling prairies lie spread out like a sea of meadows;
            and are decorated with a growth of flowers so gorgeous and grand as to
            exceed description; and nothing is more
            fruitful, or a richer stockholder in the blooming prairie than the honey
            bee. Only on the water courses is timber to be found. There in strips from
            one to three miles in width, and following faithfully the meanderings of
            the streams, it grows in luxuriant forests. The forests are a mixture of
            oak, hickory, black walnut, elm, ash, cherry, honey locust,
            mulberry, coffee bean, hackberry, boxelder, and bass wood; with the addition
            of cottonwood, butterwood, pecan, and soft and hard maple upon the bottoms.
            The
            shrubbery is beautiful, and consists in part of plums, grapes, crab apple,
            and persimmons.

            The soil is rich and fertile; from three to ten feet deep, and generally
            composed of a rich black mould, intermingled with clay and sand. It yields
            in abundance, wheat, corn, sweet potatoes, cotton and many other common
            agricultural products. Horses, cattle and hogs, though of an inferior breed,
            are tolerably plentiful and seem nearly to raise themselves by grazing
            in the vast prairie range in summer, and feeding upon the bottoms in winter.
            The wild game is less plentiful of course where man has commenced the cultivation
            of the soil, than in the wild prairies. Buffalo, elk, deer, bear, wolves,
            beaver and many smaller animals here roam at pleasure. Turkeys, geese,
            swans, ducks, yea a variety of the feathered tribe,
            are among the rich abundance that grace the delightful regions of this
            goodly land—the heritage of the children of God.

            The season is mild and delightful nearly three quarters of the year, and
            as the land of Zion, situated at about equal distances from the Atlantic
            and Pacific oceans, as well as from the Alleghany and Rocky mountains,
            in the thirty-ninth degree of north latitude, and between the sixteenth
            and seventeenth degrees of west longitude, it bids fair—when the
            curse is taken from the land—to become one of the most blessed places
            on the globe. The winters are milder than the Atlantic states of the same
            parallel of latitude, and the weather is more agreeable; so that were the
            virtues of the inhabitants only equal to the blessings of the Lord which
            He permits to crown the industry of those inhabitants, there would be a
            measure of the good things of life for the benefit of the Saints, full,
            pressed down, and
            running over, even an hundredfold.

                    HC: The early part of September was spent in making preparations to remove to the town of Hiram,
                    and renew our work on the translation of the Bible. The brethren who were commanded to go up to
                    Zion were earnestly engaged in getting ready to start in the coming October. On the 11th of September,
                    I received the following:

            Behold, thus saith the Lord your God unto you, O ye elders of my church,

        </span><verse>2</verse><span>
            For verily I say unto you, I will that ye should overcome the world; wherefore
            I will have compassion upon you.
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>
            There are those among you who have sinned; but verily I say, for this
            once, for mine own glory, and for the salvation of souls, I have forgiven
            you your sins.
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>
            I will be merciful unto you, for I have given unto you the kingdom.

                Smith, Jun., through the means I have appointed,

            There are those who have sought occasion against him without cause;
        </span><verse>7</verse><span>
            nevertheless, he has sinned; but verily I say unto you, I, the Lord, forgive
            sins unto those who confess their sins before me and ask forgiveness, who

            My disciples, in days of old, sought occasion against one another and
            forgave not one another in their hearts; and for this evil they were afflicted
            and sorely chastened.
        </span><verse>9</verse><span>
            Wherefore, I say unto you, that ye ought to forgive one another; for he
            that forgiveth not his brother his trespasses standeth condemned before
            the Lord; for there remaineth in him the greater sin.
        </span><verse>10</verse><span>
            I, the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive, but of you it is required
            to forgive all men.
        </span><verse>11</verse><span>
            And ye ought to say in your hearts, “Let God judge between me and thee,

            either by commandment or by
            revelation.
        </span><verse>13</verse><span>
            And this ye shall do that God may be glorified—not because ye forgive
            not, having not compassion, but that ye may be justified in the eyes of
            the law, that ye may not offend him who is your lawgiver—
        </span><verse>14</verse><span>
            verily I say, for this cause ye shall do these things.

        </span><verse>16</verse><span>
            they sought evil in their hearts, and I, the Lord, withheld my Spirit.
            They condemned for evil that thing in which there was no evil; nevertheless
            I have forgiven my servant Isaac Morley.
        </span><verse>17</verse><span>
            And also my servant Edward Partridge, behold, he hath sinned, and Satan
            seeketh to

            may not be tempted above that which he is able to bear, and counsel wrongfully

            I will not that my servant Frederick G. Williams should sell his farm,

        <span>
            Blessed are you, inasmuch as you have turned away from your iniquities,

            even of as many as believe on my name.
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>
            Verily I say unto you, blessed are you for receiving mine everlasting
            covenant, even the fulness of my gospel, sent forth unto the children of
            men, that they might have life and be made partakers of the glories which
            are to be revealed in the last days, as it was written by the prophets
            and apostles in days of old.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>3</verse><span>
            Verily I say unto you, my servant William, that you are clean, but not
            all; repent,
            therefore, of those things which are not pleasing in my sight, saith the
            Lord, for the Lord will show them unto you.

            you, or what is my will concerning you.
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>
            Behold, verily I say unto you, that it is my will that you should proclaim
            my gospel from land to land, and from city to city, yea, in those regions
            round about where it has not been proclaimed.
        </span><verse>6</verse><span>
            Tarry not many days in this place; go not up
            unto the land of Zion as yet; but inasmuch as you can send, send; otherwise,
            think not of thy property.
        </span><verse>7</verse><span>
            Go unto the eastern lands, bear testimony in every place, unto every people

            Let my servant Samuel H. Smith go with you, and forsake him not, and give
            him thine instructions; and he that is faithful shall be made strong in
            every place; and I, the Lord, will go with you.

            Seek not to be cumbered. Forsake all unrighteousness. Commit not adultery—a

            Keep these sayings, for they are true and faithful; and thou shalt magnify

            upon their heads.
        </span><verse>12</verse><span>
            Continue in these things even unto the end, and you shall have a crown

            Behold and hearken, O ye elders of my church, who have assembled yourselves
            together, whose prayers I have heard, and whose hearts I know, and whose
            desires have come up before me.
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>
            Behold and lo, mine eyes are upon you, and the heavens and the earth are
            in mine hands, and the riches of eternity are mine to give.
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>
            Ye endeavored to believe that ye should receive the blessing which was
            offered unto you; but behold, verily I say unto you there were fears in
            your hearts, and verily this is the reason that ye did not receive.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>4</verse><span>
            And now I, the Lord, give unto you a testimony of the truth of these commandments
            which are lying before you.
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>
            Your eyes have been upon my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and his language
            you have known, and his imperfections you have known; and you have sought
            in your hearts knowledge that you might express beyond his language; this
            you also know.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>6</verse><span>
            Now, seek ye out of the
            Book Of Commandments,
            even the least that is among them, and appoint him that is the most
            wise among you;
        </span><verse>7</verse><span>
            or, if there be any among you that shall make one like unto it, then ye
            are justified in saying that ye do not know that they are
            true;
        </span><verse>8</verse><span>
            but if ye cannot make one like unto it, ye are under condemnation if ye
            do not bear record that they are true.
        </span><verse>9</verse><span>
            For ye know that there is no unrighteousness in them, and that which is
            righteous cometh down from above, from the Father of lights.
        </span>

        <verse>10</verse><span>
            And again, verily I say unto you that it is your privilege, and a promise
            I give unto you that have been ordained unto this ministry, that inasmuch
            as you strip yourselves from
            jealousies and fears, and humble yourselves before me, for ye are not
            sufficiently humble, the veil shall be rent and you shall see me and know
            that I am—not with the carnal neither natural mind, but with the spiritual.
        </span><verse>11</verse><span>
            For no man has seen God at any time in the flesh,
            except quickened by the Spirit of God.
        </span><verse>12</verse><span>
            Neither can any natural man abide the presence of God, neither after the
            carnal mind.

    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>13</verse><span>
            Ye are not able to abide the presence of God now, neither the ministering
            of angels;
            wherefore, continue in patience until ye are perfected.
        </span><verse>14</verse><span>
            Let not your minds turn back; and when ye are worthy, in mine own due
            time, ye shall see and know that which was
            conferred upon you by the hands of my servant Joseph Smith, Jun.

                bishop when no literal descendant of Aaron can be found, provided he is

                    HC: After the foregoing was received, William McLellin…endeavored to write a commandment like
                    unto one of the least of the Lord’s, but failed; it was an awful responsibility to write in the name of the
                    Lord. The Elders and all present that witnessed this vain attempt of a man to imitate the language of
                    Jesus Christ, renewed their faith in the fulness of the Gospel, and in the truth of the commandments
                    and revelations which the Lord had given to the Church through my instrumentality; and the Elders
                    signified a willingness to bear testimony of their truth to all the world. Accordingly, I received the
                    following:

            men and are verily true. We give this testimony unto the world, the Lord

            Son Jesus Christ that we are permitted to have this privilege of
            bearing this testimony unto the world, in the which we rejoice exceedingly

                    HC: In consequence of the book of revelations being the foundation of the Church in these last days,
                    and a benefit to the world, showing that the keys of the mysteries of the kingdom of our Savior are
                    again entrusted to man; and the riches of eternity within the compass of those who are willing to live
                    by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God—therefore the conference voted that they
                    prize the revelations to be worth to the Church the riches of the whole earth, speaking temporally. The
                    great benefits to the world which result from the
                    Book of Mormon
                    and the revelations which the Lord
                    has seen fit in His infinite wisdom to grant unto us for our salvation, and for the salvation of all that will
                    believe, were duly appreciated; and in answer to an inquiry, I received the following:

            by the way of commandment unto them.
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>
            For I give unto them a commandment; wherefore hearken and hear, for thus

            I, the Lord, have appointed them, and ordained them to be stewards over
            the revelations and commandments which I have given unto them, and which
            I shall hereafter give unto them;
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>
            and an account of this stewardship will I require of them in the day of
            judgment.
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>
            Wherefore, I have appointed unto them, and this is their business in the
            church of God, to manage them and the concerns thereof, yea, the benefits
            thereof.
        </span><verse>6</verse><span>
            Wherefore, a commandment I give unto them, that they shall not give these
            things unto the church, neither unto the world;
        </span><verse>7</verse><span>
            nevertheless, inasmuch as they receive more than is needful for their
            necessities and their wants, it shall be given into my storehouse;
        </span><verse>8</verse><span>
            and the benefits shall be consecrated unto the inhabitants of Zion, and
            unto their generations, inasmuch as they become heirs according to the

            man.
        </span><verse>10</verse><span>
            And behold, none are exempt from this law who belong to the church of
            the living God;
        </span><verse>11</verse><span>
            yea, neither the

            in temporal things;
        </span><verse>13</verse><span>
            yea, even more abundantly, which abundance is multiplied unto them through
            the manifestations of the Spirit.
        </span><verse>14</verse><span>
            Nevertheless, in your temporal things you shall be equal, and this not
            grudgingly, otherwise the abundance of the manifestations of the Spirit
            shall be withheld.

            Now, this commandment I give unto my servants for their benefit while

            for a reward of their diligence and for their security;
        </span><verse>16</verse><span>
            for food and for raiment; for an inheritance; for houses and for
            lands, in whatsoever circumstances I, the Lord, shall place them, and
            whithersoever I, the
            Lord, shall send them.
        </span><verse>17</verse><span>
            For they have been faithful over many things, and have done well inasmuch
            as they have not sinned.
        </span><verse>18</verse><span>
            Behold, I, the Lord, am merciful and will bless them, and they shall enter
            into the joy of these things. Even so.

            Behold, thus saith the Lord unto you my servants Joseph Smith, Jun., and

            in me that you should open your mouths in proclaiming my gospel, the things
            of the kingdom, expounding the mysteries thereof out of the scriptures,
            according to that portion of Spirit and power
            which shall be given unto you, even as I will.
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>
            Verily I say unto you, proclaim unto the world in the regions round about,

                    in power and demonstration to the world, from the Scriptures, reasoning with men as in days of old, I
                    took a journey to Kirtland, in company with Elder Sidney Rigdon on the 3rd day of December, to fulfill
                    the above revelation. On the 4th, several of the Elders and members assembled together to learn their
                    duty, and for edification, and after some time had been spent in conversing about our temporal and
                    spiritual welfare, I received the following:

            vineyard.
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>
            And verily in this thing ye have done wisely, for it is required of the

            eternity.

        </span><verse>15</verse><span>
            thus it cometh out of the church, for according to the law every man that

                    HC: From this time until the 8th or 10th of January, 1832, myself and Elder Rigdon continued to preach
                    in Shalersville, Ravenna, and other places, setting forth the truth, vindicating the cause of our
                    Redeemer; showing that the day of vengeance was coming upon this generation like a thief in the
                    night; that prejudice, blindness and darkness filled the minds of many, and caused them to persecute
                    the true Church, and reject the true light; by which means we did much towards allaying the excited
                    feelings which were growing out of the scandalous letters then being published in the Ohio Star, at
                    Ravenna, by the before-mentioned apostate, Ezra Booth. On the 10th of January, I received the
                    following revelation making known the will of the Lord concerning the Elders of the Church until the
                    convening of the next conference.

            For verily, thus saith the Lord, it is expedient in me that they should

            conference;
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>

            and, inasmuch as it is practicable, to preach in the regions round about

                    HC: The Elders seemed anxious for me to inquire of the Lord that they might know His will, or learn
                    what would be most pleasing to Him for them to do, in order to bring men to a sense of their
                    condition; for, as it was written, “all men have gone out of the way, so that none doeth good, no not
                    one.” I inquired and received the following:

        <verse>6</verse><span>
            Therefore, verily I say unto my servant William E. McLellin, I revoke
            the commission which I gave unto him to go unto the eastern countries;

            and I give unto him a new

            calling on the name of the Lord for the Comforter, which shall teach them
            all things that are expedient for them—

            praying always that they faint not; and inasmuch as they do this, I will

            Wherefore, I, the Lord, give unto you this commandment, that ye obtain

                    HC: I resumed the translation of the Scriptures. From sundry revelations which had been received, it
                    was apparent that many important points touching the salvation of man had been taken from the
                    Bible, or lost before it was compiled. It appeared self-evident from what truths were left, that if God
                    rewarded everyone according to the deeds done in the body, the term ‘heaven’ as intended for the
                    Saints’ eternal home must include more kingdoms that one. Accordingly, on the 16th of February, 1832,
                    while translating St. John’s Gospel, myself and Elder Rigdon saw the following vision:

                to come, will I make known unto them the good pleasure of my will concerning
                all things pertaining to my kingdom.

                Yea, even the wonders of eternity shall they know, and things to come

    <verse>2</verse><question><span>What are we to understand by the four beasts, spoken of in the same verse?</span></question>
    <block>
        <span>
            They are figurative expressions, used by the Revelator, John, in describing
            heaven, the paradise of God, the happiness of man, and of beasts, and of
            creeping things, and of the fowls of the air; that which is spiritual being
            in the likeness of that which is temporal; and that which is temporal in
            the likeness of that which is spiritual; the spirit of man in the
            likeness of his person, as also the spirit of the beast, and every other
            creature which God has created.

    <block>
        <span>
            They are limited to four individual beasts, which were shown to John,
            to represent the glory of the classes of beings in their destined order
            or sphere of creation, in the enjoyment of their eternal felicity.

            Their eyes are a representation of light and knowledge, that is, they
            are full of knowledge; and their wings are a representation of power, to
            move, to act, etc.

    <block>
        <span>
            We are to understand that these elders whom John saw, were elders who
            had been faithful in the work of the ministry and were dead; who belonged
            to the seven churches, and were then in the paradise of God.

            We are to understand that it contains the revealed will, mysteries, and
            the works of God; the hidden things of his economy concerning this earth
            during the seven thousand years of its continuance, or its temporal existence.

        <span>
            We are to understand that they are four angels sent forth from God, to
            whom is given power over the four parts of the earth, to save life and
            to destroy; these are they who have the everlasting gospel to commit to
            every nation, kindred, tongue, and people; having power to shut up the
            heavens, to seal up unto life, or to cast down to the regions of

            We are to understand that the angel ascending from the east is he to whom
            is given the seal of the living God over the twelve tribes of Israel; wherefore,
            he crieth unto the four angels having the everlasting gospel, saying:

    <block>
        <span>
            We are to understand that those who are sealed are high priests, ordained
            unto the holy order of God, to administer the everlasting gospel; for they
            are they who are ordained out of every nation, kindred, tongue, and people,
            by the angels to whom is given power over the nations of the earth, to
            bring as many as will come to the church of the Firstborn.

            We are to understand that as God made the world in six days, and on the
            seventh day he
            finished his work, and sanctified it, and also formed man out of the dust
            of the earth, even so, in the beginning of the seventh thousand years will
            the Lord God sanctify the earth, and complete the salvation of man, and
            judge all things, and shall redeem all things, except that which he hath
            not put into his power, when he shall have sealed all things, unto the
            end of all things; and the sounding of the trumpets of the seven angels
            are the preparing and finishing of his work, in the beginning of the seventh
            thousand years—the preparing of the way before the time of his coming.

            We are to understand that it was a mission, and an ordinance, for him
            to gather the tribes of Israel; behold, this is Elias, who, as it is written,
            must come and restore all things.

            after they are gathered and have built the city of Jerusalem in the land

            and listen to the counsel of him
            who has ordained you from on high, who shall speak in your ears the words

        </span><verse>4</verse><span>
            for a permanent and everlasting establishment and order unto my church,

            to the glory of your Father who is in heaven;

            that you may be equal in the bonds of heavenly things, yea,

            for if you will that I give unto you a place in the celestial world, you

                    Jared Carter spent much of late 1831 and early 1832 proselytizing in Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, and
                    Vermont. A few weeks after returning home to Amherst, Ohio, he traveled to Hiram, Ohio, where
                    Joseph Smith was living. Carter recorded in his journal that the purpose of his trip was to visit the Seer to inquire the will of the Lord concerning his ministry the ensuing season.

                    Stephen Burnett was ordained to the high priesthood at the October 1831 conference when he was
                    seventeen. At the January 25, 1832 conference in Amherst, Ohio, Joseph dictated a revelation
                    appointing Burnett to travel and preach with Ruggles Eames. This revelation appointed Burnett to
                    travel and preach again, this time with Eden Smith. However, the two did not preach together until
                    August 1832 because Eden Smith became sick and remained ill for some time. Instead, two weeks after
                    this revelation was dictated, Burnett began his mission with John Smith, Eden’s father.

                    On March 8, 1832, Joseph appointed Jesse Gause and Sidney Rigdon as counselors “of the ministry of
                    the presidency of the high Priesthood.” Gause had only recently been baptized sometime in late 1831
                    or early 1832. This revelation initially addressed Gause and his duties as counselor. In January 1833,
                    Frederick G. Williams replaced Gause as counselor. Sometime before the 1835
                    Doctrine And Covenants
                    was published, Gause’s name was crossed out in the manuscript and replaced with Williams’ name.

                    efforts, declaring that such a firm would help the church in its quest to be “equal in earthly things.” The
                    firm’s mandate overlapped somewhat with Whitney’s and Partridge’s financial responsibilities as
                    bishops. Joseph received this revelation between March 8th and 24th.

            Verily thus saith the Lord unto you my servant Sidney Rigdon and Joseph.
            I reveal unto you, for your own profit and instruction, concerning the
            Bishops of my church: what is their duty in the church. Behold, it is their
            duty to stand in the office of their bishopric, and to fill the judgement
            seat which I have appointed unto them to, and to administer the benefits
            of the church or the overplus of all who are in their stewardships, according
            to the commandments as they are severly appointed. And the property, or
            that which they
            receive of the church, is not their own but belongeth to the church, wherefore
            it is the property of the Lord. And it is for the poor of the church, to
            be administered according to the law. For it is the will of the Lord that
            the church should be made equal in all things.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <span>
            Wherefore the bishops are accountable before the Lord for their stewardships,
            to
            administer of their stewardship, in the which they are appointed by commandment
            jointly with you, my servants unto the Lord, as well as you my servants,
            or the rest of the church, that the benefits of all may be dedicated unto
            the Lord, that the Lords storehouse may be filled always, that ye may all
            grow in temporal as well as spiritual things.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <span>
            And now, verily I say unto you, the bishops must needs be separated unto
            their bishoprics and judgement seats from care of business, but not from
            claim neither from council.
            Wherefore I have given unto you commandment that you should be joined
            together by covenant and bond, wherefore see that ye do even as I have
            commanded.

    <block>
        <span>
            And unto the office of the presidency of the high Priesthood I have given
            authority to
            preside with the assistance of his councilors over all the concerns of
            the church, wherefore stand ye fast. Claim your priesthood in authority
            yet in meekness. And I am able to make you abound and be fruitful and you
            shall never fall, for unto you I have given the keys of the kingdom, and
            if you transgress not they shall never be taken from you, wherefore feed
            my sheep. Even so, Amen.

        </span><verse>14</verse><span>
            For Zion must

                    Following his baptism in Kirtland in November 1830, Murdock spent much time as a traveling
                    missionary. In early 1831, Murdock decided to devote himself “full time to the ministry” and moved his
                    family in with another family so that he could do so. In June 1831, D&amp;C 52 instructed him to go to Missouri, “preaching the word by the way.” Murdock departed for Missouri despite the recent death of
                    his wife during childbirth, which left him with five children under the age of seven, including newborn
                    twins. Before leaving, he arranged for several individuals to watch over his older children; Joseph and
                    Emma Smith adopted the twins.

                    addition, those with whom he had left his three older children demanded payment for their help.

                A revelation of Jesus Christ unto his servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and six elders, as they united

                Yea, the word of the Lord concerning his church,

                prophets, and for the gathering of his saints to stand upon Mount Zion, which shall be the city of

            Therefore, as I said concerning the sons of Moses—for the sons of Moses
            and also the sons of Aaron shall offer an acceptable offering and sacrifice
            in the house of the Lord,
            which house shall be built unto the Lord in this generation, upon the

        </span><verse>44</verse><span>
            For you shall live by every word that
            proceedeth forth from the mouth of God.
        </span><verse>45</verse><span>
            For the word of the Lord is truth, and
            whatsoever is truth is light, and whatsoever is light is Spirit, even
            the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
        </span><verse>46</verse><span>
            And the Spirit giveth light to every man that cometh into the world; and
            the Spirit enlighteneth every man through the world, that hearkeneth to
            the voice of the Spirit.
        </span><verse>47</verse><span>
            And every one that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit cometh unto God,
            even the Father.
        </span><verse>48</verse><span>
            And the Father teacheth him of the covenant which he has renewed and
            confirmed upon you, which is confirmed upon you for your sakes, and not
            for your sakes only, but for the sake of the whole world.

        </span><verse>50</verse><span>
            And by this you may know they are under the bondage of sin, because they
            come not unto me.

            For whoso cometh not unto me is under the bondage of sin.

            which vanity and unbelief have brought the whole church under condemnation.

            unto you.

            Therefore, go ye into all the world; and unto whatsoever place ye cannot

            And again I say unto you, my friends, for from henceforth I shall call

            ye become even as my friends in days when I was with them, traveling to

            And any man that shall go and preach this gospel of the kingdom, and fail
            not to continue faithful in all things, shall not be weary in
            mind, neither darkened, neither in body, limb, nor joint; and a hair of
            his head shall not fall to the ground unnoticed. And they shall not go

        </span><verse>84</verse><span>
            Therefore, let the morrow take thought for the things of itself.
        </span><verse>85</verse><span>
            Neither take ye thought beforehand what ye shall say; but treasure up

            And again, verily, verily, I say unto you, it is expedient that every
            man who goes forth to proclaim mine everlasting gospel, that inasmuch as
            they have families, and receive money by gift, that they should send it
            unto them or make use of it for their benefit, as the Lord shall direct
            them, for thus it seemeth me good.
        </span><verse>104</verse><span>
            And let all those who have not families, who receive money, send it up
            unto the bishop in Zion, or unto the bishop in
            Ohio, that it may be consecrated for the bringing forth of the revelations
            and the printing thereof, and for establishing Zion.

            And if any man shall give unto any of you a coat, or a suit, take the

            And if any man among you be strong in the Spirit, let him take with him

            Therefore, take with you those who are ordained unto the

            Therefore, let

            not the head say
            unto the feet it hath no need of the feet; for without the feet how shall
            the body be able to stand?
        </span><verse>110</verse><span>

            And the bishop, Newel K. Whitney, also should travel round about and among
            all the churches, searching after the poor to administer to their wants

            those cities with the sound of the gospel, with a loud voice, of the desolation

            all those who consecrate properties, and receive inheritances legally from

            vengeance and burning, should have their names enrolled with the people

                    of December, 1832, I received the following revelation explaining the parable of the

        <verse>2</verse><span>
            Behold, verily I say, the field was the world, and the apostles were the
            sowers of the seed;
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>
            and after they have fallen asleep the great persecutor of the church,
            the apostate, the whore, even Babylon, that maketh all nations to drink
            of her cup, in whose hearts the enemy, even Satan, sitteth to reign—behold
            he soweth the tares; wherefore, the tares choke the wheat and drive the
            church into the wilderness.

            But behold, in the last days, even now while the Lord is beginning to

            behold, verily I say unto you, the angels are crying unto the Lord day
            and night, who are ready and waiting to be sent forth to reap down the
            fields;
        </span><verse>6</verse><span>

            <note><span>KJV Matthew 13:30 Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn.</span></note><span>
                Pluck not up the tares while the blade is yet tender (for verily your
                faith is weak), lest you destroy the wheat also.
            </span><verse>7</verse><span>
                Therefore, let the wheat and the tares grow together
                until the harvest is fully ripe; then ye shall first gather out the wheat
                from among the tares, and after the gathering of the wheat, behold and
                lo, the tares are bound in
                bundles, and the field remaineth to be burned.

                    HC: Appearances of troubles among the nations became more visible this season than they had
                    previously been since the Church began her journey out of the wilderness. The ravages of the cholera
                    were frightful in almost all the large cities on the globe. The plague broke out in India, while the United
                    States, amid all her pomp and greatness, was threatened with immediate dissolution. The people of
                    South Carolina, in convention assembled in November, passed ordinances, declaring their state a free
                    and independent nation; and appointed Thursday, the 31st day of January, 1833, as a day of
                    humiliation and prayer, to implore Almighty God to vouchsafe His blessings, and restore liberty and
                    happiness within their borders. President Jackson issued his proclamation against this rebellion, called
                    out a force sufficient to quell it, and implored the blessings of God to assist the nation to extricate itself
                    from the horrors of the approaching and solemn crisis. On Christmas day, I received the following
                    revelation and prophecy on war.

            Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you who have assembled yourselves together
            to receive his will concerning you:
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>
            Behold, this is pleasing unto your Lord, and the angels rejoice over you;
            the alms of your prayers have come up into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth,
            and are recorded in the book of the names of the sanctified, even them
            of the celestial world.

            Wherefore, I now send upon you another Comforter, even upon you my friends,
            that it may abide in your hearts, even the Holy Spirit of promise; which
            other Comforter is the same that I promised unto my disciples, as is recorded
            in the testimony of John.
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>
            This Comforter is the promise which I give unto you of eternal life, even
            the glory of the
            celestial kingdom;
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>
            which glory is that of the church of the Firstborn, even of God, the holiest
            of all, through Jesus Christ his Son—

            He that ascended up on high, as also he descended below all things, in
            that he
            comprehended all things, that he might be in all and through all things,
            the light of truth;

            which light proceedeth forth from the presence of God to fill the immensity
            of space—
        </span><verse>13</verse><span>
            the light
            which is in all things, which giveth life to all things, which is the
            law by which all things are governed, even the power of God who sitteth
            upon his throne, who is in the bosom of eternity, who is in the midst of
            all things.

            Now, verily I say unto you, that through the redemption which is made
            for you is brought to pass the resurrection from the dead.
        </span><verse>15</verse><span>
            And the spirit and the body are the soul of man.
        </span><verse>16</verse><span>
            And the resurrection from the dead is the redemption of the soul.
        </span><verse>17</verse><span>
            And the redemption of the soul is through him that quickeneth all things,
            in whose bosom it is
            decreed that the poor and the meek of the earth shall inherit it.
        </span><verse>18</verse><span>
            Therefore, it must needs be sanctified from all unrighteousness, that
            it may be prepared for the celestial glory;
        </span><verse>19</verse><span>
            for after it hath filled the measure of its creation, it shall be crowned
            with glory, even with the presence of God the Father;
        </span><verse>20</verse><span>
            that bodies who are of the celestial kingdom may possess it forever and
            ever; for, for this intent was it made and created, and for this intent
            are they sanctified.
        </span>

        <verse>21</verse><span>
            And they who are not sanctified through the law which I have given unto
            you, even the law of Christ, must inherit another kingdom, even that of
            a terrestrial kingdom, or that of a telestial kingdom.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>22</verse><span>For he who is not able to abide the law of a celestial kingdom</span><break></break>
        <indent><span>cannot abide a celestial glory.</span></indent>
        <verse>23</verse><span>And he who cannot abide the law of a terrestrial kingdom</span><break></break>
        <indent><span>cannot abide a terrestrial glory.</span></indent>
        <verse>24</verse><span>And he who cannot abide the law of a telestial kingdom</span><break></break>
        <indent><span>cannot abide a telestial glory;</span></indent>
        <indent><span>therefore he is not meet for a kingdom of glory.</span></indent>
        <indent><span>Therefore he must abide a kingdom which is not a kingdom of glory.</span></indent>

        <verse>25</verse><span>
            And again, verily I say unto you, the earth abideth the law of a celestial
            kingdom, for it filleth the measure of its creation, and transgresseth
            not the law—
        </span><verse>26</verse><span>
            wherefore, it shall be sanctified; yea, notwithstanding it shall die,
            it shall be quickened again, and shall abide the power by which it is quickened,
            and the righteous shall inherit it.
        </span><verse>27</verse><span>
            For notwithstanding they die, they also shall rise again, a spiritual
            body.
        </span><verse>28</verse><span>
            They who are of a celestial spirit shall receive the same body which was
            a natural body; even ye shall receive your bodies, and your glory shall
            be that glory by which your bodies are quickened.

    <block>
        <verse>29</verse><span>Ye who are quickened by a portion of the celestial glory</span><break></break>

        <indent><span>shall then receive of the same, even a fulness.</span></indent>
        <verse>31</verse><span>And also they who are quickened by a portion of the telestial glory</span><break></break>

        <verse>32</verse><span>And they who remain shall also be quickened;</span><break></break>
        <indent><span>nevertheless, they shall return again to their own place,</span></indent><span>
            to enjoy that which they are willing to receive,
        </span><break></break>
        <indent><span>because they were not willing to enjoy that which they might have received.</span></indent>

            For what doth it profit a man if a gift is bestowed upon him, and he receive
            not the gift? Behold, he rejoices not in that which is given unto him,

            And again, verily I say unto you, that which is governed by law is also
            preserved by law and perfected and sanctified by the same.
        </span><verse>35</verse><span>
            That which breaketh a law, and abideth not by law, but seeketh to become
            a law unto itself, and willeth to abide in sin, and altogether abideth
            in sin, cannot be sanctified by law, neither by mercy, justice, nor judgment.
            Therefore, they must remain filthy still.

            All kingdoms have a law given;
        </span><verse>37</verse><span>
            and there are many kingdoms; for there is no space in the which there
            is no kingdom; and there is no kingdom in which there is no space, either
            a greater or a lesser kingdom.
        </span><verse>38</verse><span>
            And unto every kingdom is given a law; and unto every
            law there are certain bounds also and conditions.
        </span><verse>39</verse><span>
            All beings who abide not in those conditions are not justified.

            Unto what shall I liken these kingdoms, that ye may understand?
        </span><verse>47</verse><span>
            Behold, all these are kingdoms, and any man who hath seen any or the least
            of these hath seen God moving in his majesty and power.
        </span><verse>48</verse><span>
            I say unto you, he hath seen him; nevertheless, he who came unto his own
            was not comprehended.
        </span><verse>49</verse><span>
            The light shineth in darkness, and the darkness
            comprehendeth it not; nevertheless, the day shall come when you shall
            comprehend even God, being quickened in him and by him.
        </span><verse>50</verse><span>
            Then shall ye know that ye have seen me, that I am, and that I am the
            true light that is in you, and that you are in me; otherwise ye
            could not abound.

    <block>
        <verse>51</verse><span>
            Behold, I will liken these kingdoms unto a man having a field, and he
            sent forth his
            servants into the field to dig in the field.
        </span><verse>52</verse><span>
            And he said unto the first, “Go ye and labor in the field, and in the
            first hour I will come unto you, and ye shall behold the joy of my countenance.”
        </span><verse>53</verse><span>
            And he said unto the second, “Go ye also into the field, and in the second
            hour I will visit you with the joy of my countenance.”
        </span><verse>54</verse><span>
            And also unto the third, saying, “I will visit you;”
        </span><verse>55</verse><span>
            and unto the fourth, and so on unto the twelfth.

            And the lord of the field went unto the first in the first hour, and tarried
            with him all that hour, and he was made glad with the light of the countenance
            of his lord.
        </span><verse>57</verse><span>
            And then he withdrew from the first that he might visit the second also,
            and the third, and the
            fourth, and so on unto the twelfth.
        </span><verse>58</verse><span>
            And thus they all received the light of the
            countenance of their lord, every man in his hour, and in his time, and
            in his season—
        </span><verse>59</verse><span>
            beginning at the first, and so on unto the last, and from the last unto
            the first, and from the first unto the last;
        </span><verse>60</verse><span>
            every man in his own order, until his hour was finished, even
            according as his lord had commanded him, that his lord might be glorified
            in him, and he in his lord, that they all might be glorified.

            And again, verily I say unto you, my friends, I leave these sayings with

            draw near unto me and I will draw near unto you; seek me diligently and

            Whatsoever ye ask the Father in my name it shall be given unto you, that

        </span><verse>65</verse><span>

            my Spirit is truth; truth abideth and hath no end; and if it be in you
            it shall abound.
        </span><verse>67</verse><span>
            And if your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled

            all things.

            Therefore, sanctify yourselves that your minds become single to God, and
            the days will come that you shall see him; for he will unveil his face
            unto you, and it shall be in his own time, and in his own way, and according

            Tarry ye, tarry ye in this place, and

        </span><verse>71</verse><span>
            And let those whom they have warned in their traveling call on the Lord,

            And I give unto you, who are the first laborers in this last kingdom,
            a commandment that you assemble yourselves together, and organize
            yourselves, and prepare yourselves, and sanctify yourselves; yea, purify
            your hearts, and cleanse your hands and your feet before me, that I may

            And I give unto you a commandment that you shall teach one another the
            doctrine of the kingdom.

            Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed
            more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the

                    D&amp;C 88:81 said “I sent you out to testify and warn the people, and it becomes every man who has
                    been warned to warn his neighbor.” Just a few days later, Joseph wrote this letter to Noah Saxton,
                    editor of the American Revivalist, and Rochester Observer, which proclaimed that it was “DEDICATED
                    TO THE INTERESTS OF ZION GENERALLY, AND ESPECIALLY TO REVIVALS OF RELIGION.” In February
                    1833, Joseph wrote another letter to Saxton, complaining that the editor had published only a portion
                    of the original letter. Joseph warned him to publish the entire letter, but Saxton did not.

            Considering the liberal principles upon which your interesting and valuable
            paper is published and myself being a subscriber and feeling a deep interest
            in the cause of Zion and in the happiness of my brethren of mankind, I
            cheerfully take up my pen to
            contribute my mite at this very interesting and important period.

            For some length of time I have been carefully viewing the state of things
            as now appear throughout our Christian land, and have looked at it with
            feelings of the most painful anxiety. While upon the one hand beholding
            the manifest withdrawal of God’s Holy
            Spirit and the veil of stupidity which seems to be drawn over the hearts
            of the people, and upon the other hand beholding the judgments of God that
            have swept and are still
            sweeping hundreds and thousands of our race (and I fear unprepared) down
            to the shades of death. With this solemn and alarming fact before me I
            am led to exclaim

                    of tears that I might weep day and night, etc.”

            I think that it is high time for a Christian world to awake out of sleep
            and cry mightily to that God day and night whose anger we have justly incurred.
            Are not these things a
            sufficient stimulant to arouse the faculties and call forth the energies
            of every man, woman, and child that possesses feeling of sympathy for his
            fellows, or that is in any degree endeared to the budding cause of our
            glorious Lord. I leave an intelligent community to answer this important
            question with a confession that this is what has
            caused me to overlook my own inability and expose my weakness to a learned
            world. But trusting in that God who has said these things are hid from
            the wise and prudent and
            revealed unto babes, I step forth into the field to tell you what the
            Lord is doing and what you must do to enjoy the smiles of your Savior in
            these last days.

            The time has at last arrived when the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of
            Jacob, has set his hand again the second time to recover the remnants of
            his people which have been left
            from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, etc., and from the islands
            of the sea, and with them to bring in the fulness of the Gentiles and establish
            that covenant with them
            which was promised when their sins should be taken away (see Romans 11:25
            27 and also Jeremiah 31:31
            32 and 33:11).
        </span>

            This covenant has never been established with the house of Israel nor
            with the house of
            Judah for it requires two parties to make a covenant, and those two parties
            must be agreed or no covenant can be made. Christ in the days of his flesh
            proposed to make a covenant with them but they rejected him and his proposals,
            and in consequence thereof they were broken off and no covenant was made
            with them at that time. But their unbelief has not
            rendered the promise of God of none effect; no, for there was another
            day limited in David which was the day of his power. And then his people
            Israel should be a willing
            people and he would write his laws in their hearts and print them in their
            thoughts. Their sins and their iniquities he would remember no more.

            Thus after this chosen family had rejected Christ and his proposals, the
            heralds of salvation said to them, “Lo we turn unto the Gentiles,
            and the Gentiles received the covenant and were grafted in from whence
            the chosen family were broken off. But the Gentiles have not continued
            in the goodness of God but have departed from the faith that was once
            delivered to the saints and have broken the covenant in which their fathers
            were
            established (see Isaiah 24:5), and have become high minded and have not
            feared therefore but few of them will be gathered with the chosen family.

            Has not the pride, high-mindedness, and unbelief of the Gentiles provoked
            the Holy One of Israel to withdraw his Holy Spirit from them and send forth
            his judgments to scourge them for their wickedness? This is certainly the
            case. Christ said to his disciples Mark 16:17–18 that, “these signs should
            follow them that believe; in my name shall they cast
            out devils, they shall speak with new tongues, they shall take up serpents,
            and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them, they shall lay
            hands on the sick and they shall
            recover.” And also in connection with this read 1 Corinthians 12. By the
            foregoing testimonies or through the glass of the foregoing testimonies
            we may look at the Christian world and see the apostacy there has been
            from the Apostolic platform, and who can look at this, and certainly not
            exclaim in the language of Isaiah,

            The plain fact is this, the power of God begins to fall upon the nations,
            and the light of the latter day glory begins to break forth through the
            dark atmosphere of sectarian wickedness and their iniquity rolls up into
            view. And the nations of the Gentiles are like the waves of the sea casting
            up mire and dirt or all in commotion. And they hastily are preparing to
            act the part allotted them when the Lord rebukes the nations, when he shall
            rule them with a rod of iron and break them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.

            servants some eighteen months since that he was then withdrawing his spirit
            from the earth, and we can see that such is the fact for not only the churches
            are dwindling away, but there are no conversions, or but very few. And
            this is not all, the governments of the earth are thrown into confusion
            and division, and destruction to the eye of the spiritual beholder seems
            to be written by the finger of an invisible hand in large capitals upon
            almost everything we behold.

            And now what remains to be done under circumstances like these? I will
            proceed to tell you what the Lord requires of all people high and low,
            rich and poor, male and female, ministers and people, professors of religion
            and nonprofessors, in order that they may enjoy the Holy Spirit of God
            to a fulness, and escape the judgments of God which are
            almost ready to burst upon the nations of the earth. Repent of all your
            sins and be baptized in water for the remission of them, in the name of
            the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, and receive the ordinance
            of the laying on of the hands of him who is
            ordained and sealed unto this power, that ye may receive the Holy Spirit
            of God. And this according to the holy scriptures, and of the
            Book of Mormon,
            and the only way that man can enter into the celestial kingdom. These are the
            requisitions of the new covenant or first principles of no professors the gospel of Christ;
            then add to your faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and to knowledge
            temperance, and to temperance patience, and to patience brotherly kindness,
            and to brotherly kindness charity (or love). And if these things be in
            you and abound, they make you to be neither baren nor unfruitful in the
            knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.

            The
            Book of Mormon
            is a record of the forefathers of our western tribes of Indians, having
            been found through the ministration of an holy angel, translated into our
            own language by the gift and power of God, after having been hid up in
            the earth for the last fourteen hundred years, containing the word of God,
            which was delivered unto them. By it we learn that our western tribes of
            Indians are descendants from that Joseph that was
            sold into Egypt, and that the land of America is a promised land unto
            them, and unto it all the tribes of Israel will come. with as many of the
            gentiles as shall comply with the
            requisitions of the new covenant, but the tribe of Judah will return to
            old Jerusalem. The city of Zion, spoken of by David in the 102 Psalm, will
            be built upon the land of America and the ransomed of the Lord shall return
            and come to it with songs and everlasting joy
            upon their heads, and then they will be delivered from the overflowing
            scourge that shall pass through the land. But Judah shall obtain deliverance
            at Jerusalem (see Joel 2:32, Isaiah 26:20–21, Jeremiah 31:12, Psalm 50:5,
            Ezekiel 34:11–13). These are testimonies that the good Shepherd will put
            forth his own sheep and lead them out from all nations where they have
            been scattered in a cloudy and dark day, to Zion and to Jerusalem, beside
            many more testimonies which might be brought.

            And now I am prepared to say by the authority of Jesus Christ, that not
            many years shall pass away before the United States shall present such
            a scene of bloodshed as has not a parallel in the history of our nation.
            Pestilence, hail, famine, and earthquake will sweep the wicked of this
            generation from off the face of this land, to open and prepare the way
            for the return of the lost tribes of Israel from the north country. The
            people of the Lord, those who have complied with the requisitions of the
            new covenant, have already commenced gathering together to Zion, which
            is in the State of Missouri. Therefore, I declare unto you the warning
            which the Lord has commanded me to declare unto this generation, remembering
            that the eyes of my maker are upon me and that to him I am accountable
            for every word I say, wishing nothing worse to my fellow men than their
            eternal salvation. Therefore, fear God and give glory to him, for the
            hour of his judgment is come. Repent ye, repent ye, and embrace the everlasting
            covenant and flee to Zion before the overflowing scourge overtakes you.
            For there are those now living upon the earth whose eyes shall not be closed
            in death until they see all these things which I have spoken fulfilled.
            Remember these things, call upon the Lord while he is near and seek him
            while he may be found, is the exhortation of your unworthy servant.

                    manifestations of the Holy Spirit.

                    HC: On the 23rd of January, we again assembled in conference; when, after much speaking, singing,
                    praying, and praising God, all in tongues, we proceeded to the washing of feet (according to the
                    practice recorded in the 13th chapter of John’s Gospel), as commanded of the Lord. Each Elder washed
                    his own feet first, after which I girded myself with a towel and washed the feet of all of them, wiping
                    them with the towel with which I was girded…I then said to the Elders, “As I have done so do ye; wash
                    ye, therefore, one another’s feet;” and by the power of the Holy Ghost I pronounced them all clean
                    from the blood of this generation; but if any of them should sin willfully after they were thus cleansed,
                    and sealed up unto eternal life, they should be given over unto the buffetings of Satan until the day of
                    redemption. Having continued all day in fasting, and prayer, and ordinances, we closed by partaking of
                    the Lord’s supper. I blessed the bread and wine in the name of the Lord, when we all ate and drank,
                    and were filled; then we sang a hymn, and the meeting adjourned.

                    In D&amp;C 81 Jesse Gause was called to be a counselor to Joseph. Gause was excommunicated on
                    December 3, 1832. On January 5, 1833, Frederick G. Williams was called to replace Gause, though he
                    was not ordained to this position until March 18, 1833.

            Thus saith the Lord, verily, verily I say unto you my son, thy sins are
            forgiven thee,
            according to thy petition, for thy prayers and the prayers of thy brethren
            have come up into my ears.
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>
            Therefore, thou art blessed from henceforth that bear the keys of the
            kingdom given unto you; which kingdom is coming forth for the last time.
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>
            Verily I say unto you, the keys of this kingdom shall never be taken from
            you, while thou art in the world, neither in the world to come;
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>
            nevertheless, through you shall the oracles be given to another, yea,
            even unto the church.
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>
            And all they who receive the oracles of God, let
            them beware how they hold them lest they are accounted as a light thing,
            and are brought under condemnation thereby, and stumble and fall when the
            storms descend, and the
            winds blow, and the rains descend, and beat upon their house.

            And again, verily I say unto thy brethren, Sidney Rigdon and Frederick
            G. Williams, their sins are forgiven them also, and they are accounted
            as equal with thee in holding the keys of this last kingdom;
        </span><verse>7</verse><span>
            as also through your administration the keys of the school of the prophets,
            which I have commanded to be organized;
        </span><verse>8</verse><span>
            that thereby they may be
            perfected in their ministry for the salvation of Zion, and of the nations
            of Israel, and of the Gentiles, as many as will believe;
        </span><verse>9</verse><span>
            that through your administration they may receive the word, and through
            their administration the word may go forth unto the ends of the earth,
            unto the Gentiles first, and then, behold, and lo, they shall turn unto
            the Jews.
        </span><verse>10</verse><span>
            And then cometh the day when the arm of the Lord shall be revealed in
            power in convincing the nations, the heathen nations, the house of Joseph,
            of the gospel of their salvation.
        </span><verse>11</verse><span>
            For it shall come to pass in that day, that every man shall hear the fulness
            of the gospel in his
            own tongue, and in his own language, through those who are ordained unto
            this power, by the administration of the Comforter, shed forth upon them

            and

            And this shall be your business and mission in all your lives, to preside

        </span><verse>17</verse><span>
            Be not ashamed, neither confounded; but be admonished in all your high-mindedness

            G. Williams.
        </span><verse>20</verse><span>
            And let mine aged
            servant, Joseph Smith, Sen., continue with his family upon the place where
            he now lives; and let it not be sold until the mouth of the Lord shall
            name.

            that thereby he may be enabled to

            that those things that are provided for you, to bring to pass my work,

        </span><verse>29</verse><span>
            and the residue of the money may be consecrated unto me, and she be rewarded
            in mine own due time.
        </span><verse>30</verse><span>
            Verily I say unto you, that it is meet in mine eyes that she should go
            up unto the land of Zion, and receive an inheritance from the hand of the
            bishop;
        </span><verse>31</verse><span>
            that she may settle down in peace inasmuch as she is faithful, and not

            And behold, verily I say unto you, that ye shall write this commandment,

            you also to preside over Zion in mine own due time.
        </span><verse>33</verse><span>
            Therefore, let them cease wearying me concerning this matter.
        </span><verse>34</verse><span>
            Behold, I say unto you that your brethren in Zion begin to repent, and
            the angels rejoice over them.
        </span><verse>35</verse><span>
            Nevertheless, I am not well pleased with many things; and I am not well

        </span><verse>36</verse><span>
            But verily I say unto you, that I, the Lord, will contend with Zion, and

            clean before me.

                    HC: Great joy and satisfaction continually beamed in the countenances of the School of the Prophets,
                    and the Saints, on account of the things revealed, and our progress in the knowledge of God. The High
                    Priests assembled in the school room of the Prophets, and were organized according to revelation;
                    prayer by Sidney Rigdon.

                    "Doctor" Hurlburt was ordained an Elder; after which Elder Rigdon expressed a desire that himself and
                    Brother Frederick G. Williams should be ordained to the offices to which they had been called, viz.,
                    those of Presidents of the High Priesthood, and to be equal in holding the keys of the kingdom with
                    Brother Joseph Smith, Jun., according to the revelation given on the 8th of March, 1833. Accordingly I
                    laid my hands on Brothers Sidney and Frederick, and ordained them to take part with me in holding the
                    keys of this last kingdom, and to assist in the Presidency of the High Priesthood, as my Counselors;
                    after which I exhorted the brethren to faithfulness and diligence in keeping the commandments of
                    God, and gave much instruction for the benefit of the Saints, with a promise that the pure in heart
                    should see a heavenly vision; and after remaining a short time in secret prayer, the promise was
                    verified; for many present had the eyes of their understanding opened by the Spirit of God, so as to
                    behold many things. I then blessed the bread and wine, and distributed a portion to each. Many of the
                    brethren saw a heavenly vision of the Savior, and concourses of angels, and many other things, of
                    which each one has a record of what he saw.

                    Little is known about the circumstances surrounding this revelation. It was not mentioned in any
                    journals nor in John Whitmer’s or John Corrill’s histories. Newell Whitney wrote on the back of the manuscript, “Revelation to Joseph, Sidney, Frederick, &amp; Newell by chastisement &amp; also relative to the
                    Father &amp; Son.”

            Verily, thus saith the Lord: It shall come to pass that every soul who
            forsaketh his sins and cometh unto me, and calleth on my name, and obeyeth
            my voice, and keepeth my commandments, shall see my face and know that
            I am;
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>
            and that I am the true light that
            lighteth every man that cometh into the world;
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>
            and that I am in the Father, and the
            Father in me, and the Father and I are one—
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>
            the Father because he gave me of his fulness, and the Son because I was
            in the world and made flesh my tabernacle, and dwelt among the sons of
            men.
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>
            I was in the world and received of my Father, and the works of him
            were plainly manifest.

                    therefore, in the beginning the Word was, for he was the Word, even the

                </span><verse>9</verse><span>
                    the light and the Redeemer of the world; the Spirit of truth, who came

                    of men and the light of men.

                    The worlds were made by him; men were made by him; all things were made

                    truth, which came and dwelt in the flesh, and dwelt among us.

                    And I, John, saw that he received not of the fulness at the first, but
                    received grace for grace;
                </span><verse>13</verse><span>
                    and he received not of the fulness at first, but continued from grace

                </span><verse>14</verse><span>
                    and thus he was called the Son of God, because he received not of the

                    upon him in the form of a dove, and sat upon him, and there came a voice

            I give unto you these sayings that you may understand and know how to

            For if you keep my commandments you shall

            and all those who are begotten through me are partakers of the glory of

            Ye were also in the beginning with the Father; that which is Spirit, even

        </span><verse>24</verse><span>
            and truth is knowledge of things as they are, and as they were, and as

            The Spirit of truth is of God. I am the Spirit of truth, and John bore

            truth;”
        </span><verse>27</verse><span>
            and no man receives a fulness unless he keepeth his commandments.

            He that keepeth his

            Man was also in the beginning with God. Intelligence, or the light of
            truth, was not
            created or made, neither indeed can be.
        </span><verse>30</verse><span>
            All truth is independent in that sphere in which God has placed it, to

                    HC: Great preparations were making to commence a house of the Lord; and notwithstanding the
                    Church was poor, yet our unity, harmony and charity abounded to strengthen us to do the
                    commandments of God. The building of the house of the Lord in Kirtland was a matter that continued
                    to increase in its interest in the hearts of the brethren, and the building committee issued the following
                    circular to the different branches of the Church:
                </span>
            </block>

            <block><span>To the Church of Christ in —</span></block>

            <block>
                <span>
                    We feel under obligations to write to you as well as to all the brethren of the different branches; and
                    we do this, that you, with us, may exert yourselves to bring about the fulfilment of the command of the
                    Lord concerning the establishing, or preparing a house, wherein the Elders who have been commanded
                    of the Lord so to do, may gather themselves together, and prepare all things, and call a solemn
                    assembly, and treasure up words of wisdom, that they may go forth to the Gentiles for the last time;
                    and now, in order to accomplish this, we are directed, yea, we are under the necessity, to call upon the
                    whole Church as a body, that they make every possible exertion to aid temporally, as well as spiritually,
                    in this great work that the Lord is beginning, and is about to accomplish. And unless we fulfil this
                    command, viz: establish an house, and prepare all things necessary whereby the elders may gather into
                    a school, called the School of the Prophets, and receive that instruction which the Lord designs they
                    should receive, we may all despair of obtaining the great blessing that God has promised to the faithful
                    of the Church of Christ; therefore it is as important, as our salvation, that we obey this above mentioned command, as well as all the commandments of the Lord.

                    Therefore, brethren, we write this epistle to you, to stir up your minds to make that exertion which the
                    Lord requires of you, to lend a temporal aid in these things above written…Our Heavenly Father is
                    opening the hearts of our brethren beyond the expectation of many; and not one brother among us, as
                    yet, refuses to exert himself to do something in a temporal way to bring about the establishing of this
                    house and school; and we say, may our Heavenly Father open your hearts also, that you, with us, may
                    gather together something to aid as a temporal benefit…May the Lord help you to exert yourselves
                    with us, in raising the means to bring about the glorious work of the Lord; and may we all be kept by
                    the grace of God unto eternal life.

            Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you whom I love, and whom I love I also
            chasten that their sins may be forgiven, for with the chastisement I prepare
            a way for their deliverance in all things out of temptation, and I have
            loved you—
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>
            wherefore, ye must needs be
            chastened and stand rebuked before my face;
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>
            for ye have sinned against me a very
            grievous sin, in that ye have not considered the great commandment in
            all things, that I have given unto you concerning the building of mine
            house;
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>
            for the preparation
            wherewith I design to prepare mine apostles to prune my vineyard for the
            last time, that I may bring to pass my strange act, that I may pour out
            my Spirit upon all flesh—
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>
            but behold, verily I say unto you, that there are many who have been ordained
            among you,
            whom I have called but few of them are chosen.
        </span><verse>6</verse><span>
            They who are not chosen have sinned a very grievous sin, in that they
            are walking in darkness at noon-day.
        </span>

    <block>
        <verse>7</verse><span>
            And for this cause I gave unto you a commandment that you should call
            your solemn assembly, that your fastings and your mourning might come up
            into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth, which is by interpretation, the creator
            of the first day, the beginning and the end.
        </span><verse>8</verse><span>
            Yea, verily I say unto you, I gave unto you a commandment that you should
            build a house, in the which house I design to endow those whom I have chosen
            with power from on high;
        </span><verse>9</verse><span>
            for this is the promise of the Father unto you; therefore I command you
            to tarry, even as mine apostles at Jerusalem.
        </span><verse>10</verse><span>
            Nevertheless, my servants sinned a very grievous sin; and contentions
            arose in the school of the prophets; which was very grievous unto me, says
            your Lord; therefore I sent them forth to be chastened.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>11</verse><span>
            Verily I say unto you, it is my will that you should build a house. If
            you keep my commandments you shall have power to build it.
        </span><verse>12</verse><span>
            If you keep not my commandments, the love of the Father shall not continue
            with you, therefore you shall walk in darkness.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>13</verse><span>
            Now here is wisdom, and the mind of the Lord—let the house be built, not
            after the manner of the world, for I give not unto you that ye shall live
            after the manner of the world;
        </span><verse>14</verse><span>
            therefore, let it be built after the manner which I shall show unto three
            of you,
            whom ye shall appoint and ordain unto this power.
        </span><verse>15</verse><span>
            And the size thereof shall be fifty and five feet in width, and let it
            be sixty-five feet in length, in the inner court thereof.
        </span><verse>16</verse><span>
            And
            let the lower part of the inner court be dedicated unto me for your sacrament
            offering, and for your preaching, and your fasting, and your praying, and
            the offering up of your most holy desires unto me, says your Lord.
        </span><verse>17</verse><span>
            And let the higher part of the inner court be dedicated unto me for the
            school of mine apostles, says Son Ahman; or, in other words, Alphus; or,
            in other words, Omegus; even Jesus Christ your Lord.

                    HC: A similar conference assembled at the same place and took into consideration how the French
                    farm should be disposed of. The conference could not agree who should take charge of it, but all
                    agreed to inquire of the Lord; accordingly we received the following:

            Behold, I say unto you, here is wisdom, whereby ye may know how to act
            concerning this matter, for it is expedient in me that this stake that
            I have set for the strength of Zion should be made strong.
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>
            Therefore, let my servant Newel K. Whitney take charge of the place which
            is named among you, upon which I design to build mine holy house.
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>
            And again, let it be divided into lots, according to wisdom, for the benefit
            of those who seek inheritances, as it shall be determined in council among
            you.
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>
            Therefore, take heed that ye see to this matter, and that portion that
            is necessary to benefit mine order, for the purpose of bringing forth my
            word to the children of men.
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>
            For behold, verily I say unto you, this is the most expedient in me, that
            my word should go forth unto the children of men, for the purpose of subduing
            the hearts of the children of men for your good. Even so.

        <verse>6</verse><span>
            And again, verily I say unto you, it is wisdom and expedient in me, that
            my servant John Johnson whose offering I have accepted, and whose prayers
            I have heard, unto whom I give a promise of eternal life inasmuch as he
            keepeth my commandments from henceforth—
        </span><verse>7</verse><span>
            for he is a descendant of Joseph and a partaker of the blessings of the
            promise made unto his fathers—
        </span><verse>8</verse><span>
            verily I say unto you, it is expedient in me that he should become a member
            of the order, that he may assist in bringing forth my word unto the children
            of men.
        </span><verse>9</verse><span>
            Therefore ye shall ordain him unto this blessing, and he shall seek diligently
            to take away incumbrances that are upon the house named among you, that
            he may dwell therein. Even so.

                    In accordance with D&amp;C 88, members of the Church of Christ in Jackson County, Missouri, organized a
                    local version school of the prophets in summer 1833 called the School in Zion. It met weekly and had
                    about sixty students. By early July 1833, they desired to know God’s will concerning the school and
                    sent two letters to Joseph. In response, the presidency of the high priesthood wrote a letter to
                    Missouri leaders on August 6 that included this revelation, which they referred to as “the
                    communication which we received from the Lord concerning the school in Zion.”

            the voice of my Spirit, that I may show unto you my will concerning your
            brethren in the land of Zion, many of whom are truly humble and are seeking
            diligently to learn wisdom and to find
            truth.
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>
            Verily, verily I say unto you, blessed are such, for they shall obtain;

            And inasmuch as he continueth to abide in me he shall continue to preside

            And I will bless him with a multiplicity of blessings, in expounding all

            The ax is laid at the root of the trees; and every tree that bringeth

                    By summer 1833, church leaders planned for and began construction on a House of the Lord in
                    Kirtland, which was to serve as both a chapel and a schoolhouse. The presidency of the high priesthood
                    was assigned to create a design for the interior of the building. Three weeks later they sent to Missouri
                    church leaders the architectural plans for another House of the Lord, similar in style and purpose, to be
                    built in Independence, Missouri.

                    Four days after Joseph dictated this revelation, the presidency copied it into a letter they sent to
                    Missouri, which stated this revelation “is also binding on you, that is you at Zion have to build two
                    houses as well as the one of which we have sent the pattern.” In other words, the Missouri church members should build three buildings in Independence: the House of the Lord, an administrative house
                    for church business, and one for their printing establishment.

                    Daniel 9:24–25 prophecies about a 69 week period of time after the command to build Jerusalem is
                    given and a 70 week period of time to make reconciliation for iniquity. 69 weeks after August 2, 1833
                    was November 29, 1834, when Joseph and Oliver entered into a covenant of tithing for the
                    continuation of blessings. 70 weeks after that was April 3, 1836, when the Messiah appeared to Joseph
                    and Oliver in Kirtland.

            you, that ye shall commence a work of laying out and preparing a beginning

                    Tensions in Missouri had been increasing, and though Joseph didn’t know it yet, the church printing
                    office in Independence had been destroyed. Less than two weeks after this revelation was received,
                    Joseph wrote that “We are no safer here in Kirtland then you are in Zion, the cloud is gathering around
                    us with great fury and all pharaoh’s host or in other words all hell and the combined powers of Earth
                    are marshalling their forces to overthrow us.”

            Verily I say unto you my friends, fear not, let your hearts be comforted;
            yea, rejoice
            evermore, and in everything give thanks;
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>
            waiting patiently on the Lord, for your prayers have entered into the
            ears of the Lord of Sabaoth, and are recorded with this seal and testament—the
            Lord hath sworn and decreed that they shall be granted.
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>
            Therefore, he giveth this promise unto you, with an immutable covenant
            that they shall be fulfilled; and
            all things wherewith you have been afflicted shall work together for your
            good, and to my name’s glory, saith the Lord.

            And now, verily I say unto you concerning the laws of the land, it is
            my will that my people should observe to do all things whatsoever I command
            them.
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>
            And that law of the land which is constitutional, supporting that principle
            of freedom in maintaining rights
            and privileges, belongs to all mankind, and is justifiable before me.
        </span><verse>6</verse><span>
            Therefore, I, the Lord, justify you, and your brethren of my church, in
            befriending that law which is the constitutional law of the land;
        </span><verse>7</verse><span>
            and as pertaining to law of man, whatsoever is more or less than this,
            cometh of evil.
        </span><verse>8</verse><span>
            I, the Lord God, make you free, therefore ye are free indeed; and the
            law also maketh you free.
        </span><verse>9</verse><span>
            Nevertheless, when the wicked rule the people mourn.
        </span><verse>10</verse><span>
            Wherefore, honest men and wise men should be sought for diligently, and
            good men and wise men ye should observe to uphold; otherwise whatsoever
            is less than these cometh of evil.

        <verse>11</verse><span>
            And I give unto you a commandment, that ye shall forsake all evil and
            cleave unto all good, that ye shall live by every word which proceedeth
            forth out of the mouth of God.
        </span><verse>12</verse><span>
            For he will give unto the faithful line upon line, precept upon precept;
            and I will try you and prove you herewith.
        </span><verse>13</verse><span>
            And whoso layeth down his life in my cause, for my name’s sake, shall
            find it again, even life eternal.
        </span><verse>14</verse><span>
            Therefore, be not afraid of your enemies, for I have decreed in my heart,
            saith the Lord, that I will prove you in all things, whether you will abide
            in my covenant, even unto death, that you may be found worthy.
        </span><verse>15</verse><span>

            Let not your hearts be troubled; for in my Father’s house are many mansions,

                if men will smite you, or your families, once, and ye bear it patiently

            </span><verse>24</verse><span>
                but if ye bear it not patiently, it shall be accounted unto you as being

                And again, if your enemy shall smite you the second time, and you revile
                not against your enemy, and bear it patiently, your reward shall be an
                hundred-fold.

            </span>
        </dot>
        <verse>27</verse><span>
            and these three testimonies shall stand against your enemy if he repent

        <verse>28</verse><span>
            And now, verily I say unto you, if that enemy shall escape my vengeance,
            that he be not brought into judgment before me, then ye shall see to it
            that ye warn him in my name, that he come no more upon you, neither upon
            your family, even your children’s children unto the third and fourth generation.
        </span><verse>29</verse><span>
            And then, if he shall come upon you or your
            children, or your children’s children unto the third and fourth generation,
            I have delivered thine enemy into thine hands;
        </span><verse>30</verse><span>
            and then if thou wilt spare him, thou shalt be rewarded for thy righteousness;

            And if any nation, tongue, or people should proclaim war against them,

                    HC: I started on a journey to the east, and to Canada, in company with Elders Rigdon and Freeman
                    Nickerson…On the 12th, arrived at Father Nickerson's, at Perrysburg, New York, where I received the
                    following revelation.

                    On October 12, Joseph had written in his diary, “I feel very well in my mind the Lord is with us but have
                    much anxiety about my family.”

            Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you, my friends Sidney and Joseph, your
            families are
            well; they are in mine hands, and I will do with them as seemeth me good;
            for in me there is all power.
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>
            Therefore, follow me, and listen to the counsel which I shall give unto
            you.

            Behold, and lo, I have much people in this place, in the regions round
            about; and an
            effectual door shall be opened in the regions round about in this eastern
            land.
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>
            Therefore, I, the Lord, have suffered you to come unto this place; for
            thus it was expedient in me for the salvation of souls.
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>
            Therefore, verily I say unto you, lift up your voices unto this people;
            speak the thoughts that I shall put into your hearts, and you shall not
            be confounded before men;
        </span><verse>6</verse><span>
            for it shall be given you in the very hour, yea, in the very moment, what
            ye shall say.
        </span><verse>7</verse><span>
            But a commandment I give unto you, that ye shall declare whatsoever thing
            ye declare in my name, in solemnity of heart, in the spirit of meekness,
            in all things.
        </span><verse>8</verse><span>
            And I give unto you this promise, that inasmuch as ye do this the Holy
            Ghost shall be shed forth in bearing record unto all things whatsoever
            ye shall say.

            And it is expedient in me that you, my servant Sidney, should be a spokesman
            unto this people; yea, verily, I will ordain you unto this calling, even
            to be a spokesman unto my servant Joseph.
        </span><verse>10</verse><span>
            And I will give unto him power to be mighty in testimony.
        </span><verse>11</verse><span>
            And I will give unto thee power to be mighty in expounding all scriptures,
            that thou mayest be a spokesman unto him, and he shall be a revelator unto
            thee, that thou mayest know the
            certainty of all things pertaining to the things of my kingdom on the
            earth.
        </span><verse>12</verse><span>
            Therefore, continue your journey and let your hearts rejoice; for behold,
            and lo, I am with you even unto the end.

            And now I give unto you a word concerning Zion. Zion shall be redeemed,
            although she is chastened for a little season.
        </span><verse>14</verse><span>
            Thy brethren, my servants Orson Hyde and John Gould, are in my hands;
            and inasmuch as they keep my commandments they shall be saved.
        </span><verse>15</verse><span>
            Therefore, let your hearts be comforted; for all things shall work together
            for good to them that walk uprightly, and to the sanctification of the
            church.
        </span><verse>16</verse><span>
            For I will raise up unto myself a pure people, that will serve me in righteousness;
        </span><verse>17</verse><span>
            and all that call upon the name of the Lord, and keep his commandments,
            shall be saved. Even so.

                    Joseph received two letters detailing the problems the members in Missouri were facing. This letter
                    was his response.

            I cannot learn from any communication by the spirit to me that Zion has
            forfeited her claim to a celestial crown notwithstanding the Lord has caused
            her to be thus afflicted;
            except it may be some individuals who have walked in disobedience and
            forsaken the new covenants; all such will be made manifest by their works
            in due time. I have always
            expected that Zion would suffer sore affliction. From what I could learn
            from the commandments which have been given but I would remind you of a
            certain clause in one which says that after much tribulation cometh the
            blessing. By this and also others, and also one received of late, I know
            that Zion, in the own due time of the Lord will be
            redeemed, but how many will be the days of her purification, tribulation
            and affliction, the Lord has kept hid from my eyes; and when I enquire
            concerning this subject the voice of the Lord is:
        </span><quote>
            <span>
                Be still, and know that I am God! All those who suffer for my name shall
                reign with me, and he that layeth down his life for my sake shall find
                it again.

            Now there are two things of which I am ignorant and the Lord will not
            show me— perhaps for a wise purpose in himself. I mean in some respects,
            and they are these:
        </span><dot>
            <span>
                Why God hath suffered so great calamity to come upon Zion; or what the
                great moving cause of this great affliction is.

                And again, by what means he will return her back to her inheritance with
                songs of everlasting joy upon her head.

            These two things brethren, are in part kept back that they are not plainly
            shewn unto me. But there are some things that are plainly manifest, that
            has incurred the displeasure of the Almighty. When I contemplate upon all
            things that have been manifested, I am sensible that I ought not to murmur
            and do not murmur, only in this: that those who are innocent are compelled
            to suffer for the iniquities of the guilty. And I cannot account for this,
            only on this wise, that the saying of the Savior has not been strictly
            observed,

            Now the fact is, if any of the members of our body are disordered, the
            rest of our body will be effected with them and then all is brought into
            bondage together. And yet notwithstanding all this, it is with difficulty
            that I can restrain my feelings; when I know that you my brethren with
            whom I have had so many happy hours, sitting as it were in heavenly places
            in Christ Jesus, and also having the witness which I feel, and even have
            felt, of the purity of your motives—are cast out, and are as strangers
            and pilgrims on the earth, exposed to hunger, cold, nakedness peril, sword,
            etc. I say when I contemplate this, it is with difficulty that I can keep
            from complaining and murmurings against this
            dispensation; but I am sensible that this is not right and may God grant
            that notwithstanding your great afflictions and sufferings there may not
            anything separate us from the love of Christ.

            Brethren, when we learn your sufferings it awakens every sympathy of our
            hearts; it
            weighs us down; we cannot refrain from tears [illegible] yet we are not
            able to realize only in part your sufferings. And I often hear the brethren
            saying they wish they were with you that they might bear a part of your
            sufferings; and I myself should have been with you had not God prevented
            it in the order of his providence, that the yoke of affliction might be
            less grievous upon you; God having forewarned me concerning these things
            for your sakes; and also brother Oliver Cowdery could not lighten your
            afflictions by tarrying longer
            with you, for his presence would have so much the more enraged your enemies;
            therefore, God hath deals dealt mercifully with us.
        </span>

            O brethren, let us be thankful that it is as well with us as it is, and
            we are yet alive that
            peradventure, God hath laid up in store great good for us in this generation,
            and grant that we may yet glorify his name. I feel thankful that there
            have no more denied the faith. I
            pray God, in the name of Jesus, that you all may be kept in the faith
            unto the end. Let your sufferings be what they may, it is better that you
            should die in the eyes of God than that you should give up the land of
            Zion, the inheritances which you have purchased with your monies. For every
            man that giveth not up his inheritances though he should die yet, when
            the Lord shall come he shall stand upon it and with Job in his flesh he
            shall see God.

            Therefore this is my council that you retain your lands even unto the
            uttermost, and seeking every lawful means to obtain redress of your enemies,
            etc., and pray to God day
            and night to return you in peace and in safety to the Lands of your inheritance,
            and when the Judge fails you, appeal unto the Executive, and when the Executive
            fails you, appeal unto the President, and when the President fails you,
            and all laws fail you and the
            humanity of the people fails you, and all things else fails you but God
            alone, and you continue to weary him with your importunings, as the poor
            woman the unjust Judge, he will not fail to execute judgment upon your
            enemies and to avenge his own elect that cry unto him day and night—Behold
            he will not fail you! He will come with ten thousand of his saints and
            all his adversaries shall be destroyed by the breath of his lips!

            All those that keep their inheritances notwithstanding they should be
            pealed and driven shall be likened unto the wise virgins who took oil in
            their lamps. But all those who are unbelieving and fearful, will be likened
            unto the foolish virgins, who took no oil in their lamps; and when they
            shall return and say unto the saints, give us of your lands, behold there
            will be no room found for them.

            As respects giving deeds I would advise to give deeds as far as the brethren
            have legal and just claims for them and then let every man answer to God
            for the disposal of them. I would suggest some ideas to Brother William
            P., not knowing as they will be of any real benefit, but suggest them for
            consideration I would be glad that he were here, but dare not advise, were
            it possible for him to come, not knowing what shall befall us, as we are
            under very heavy and serious threatening from a great many people in this
            place. But
            perhaps the people in Liberty may feel willing, God having power to soften
            the hearts of all men, to have a press established there; and if not, in
            some other place; any place where it can be the most convenient and it
            is possible to get to it. God will be willing to have it in any place where
            it can be established in safety. We must be wise as serpents and harmless
            as doves. Again I desire that Brother William would collect all the information,
            and give us a true history of the beginning and rise of Zion and her calamities,
            etc.

                    by commandment and sent them to Missouri, a place which thou didst call
                    Zion and commanded thy servants to consecrate unto thyself for a place
                    of a refuge, and of
                    safety for the gathering of thy saints, to be built up a holy city unto

                    brethren unto whom I write. Send thy angels to guard them and to deliver
                    them from
                    all evil. And when they turn their faces towards Zion and bow down before
                    thee and pray, may their sins never come up before thy face, neither have
                    place in the book of thy remembrance, and may they depart from all their
                    iniquities. Provide food for them as thou doest for the ravens, provide
                    clothing to cover their nakedness, and houses that they may dwell therein.
                    Give unto them friends in abundance, and let their names be recorded in
                    the Lamb’s book of life eternally before thy face.

                    As details of the violent events in Missouri reached Kirtland, Ohio, in late fall, Joseph sought to
                    understand why church members were expelled from Jackson County, what it meant for the gathering
                    to Zion, and what church members should do to regain their lands. On December 10, Joseph wrote that
                    the Lord was keeping hid from him the answers to those questions. After receiving this revelation,
                    Joseph sent it to the church in Missouri in a letter dated January 22, 1834.

            Verily I say unto you, concerning your brethren who have been afflicted,
            and persecuted, and cast out from the land of their inheritance—
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>
            I, the Lord, have suffered the affliction to come upon them, wherewith
            they have been afflicted, in consequence of their
            transgressions;
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>
            yet I will own them, and they shall be mine in that day when I shall come
            to make up my jewels.
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>
            Therefore, they must needs be chastened and tried, even as
            Abraham, who was commanded to offer up his only son.
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>
            For all those who will not endure chastening, but deny me, cannot be sanctified.

        <verse>6</verse><span>
            Behold, I say unto you, there were jarrings, and contentions, and envyings,
            and strifes, and lustful and covetous desires among them; therefore by
            these things they polluted their inheritances.
        </span><verse>7</verse><span>
            They were slow to hearken unto the voice of the Lord their God; therefore,
            the Lord their God is slow to hearken unto their prayers, to answer them
            in the day of their trouble.
        </span><verse>8</verse><span>
            In the day of their peace they esteemed lightly my counsel; but, in the
            day of their trouble, of necessity they feel after me.

        <verse>9</verse><span>
            Verily I say unto you, notwithstanding their sins, my bowels are filled
            with compassion towards them. I will not utterly cast them off; and in
            the day of wrath I will remember mercy.
        </span><verse>10</verse><span>
            I have sworn, and the decree has gone forth by a former commandment which
            I have given unto you, that I would let fall the sword of mine indignation
            in behalf of my people; and even as I have said, it shall come to pass.
        </span><verse>11</verse><span>
            Mine indignation is soon to be
            poured out without measure upon all nations; and this will I do when the
            cup of their iniquity is full.

            And they that have been scattered shall be gathered.

        </span><verse>16</verse><span>
            Therefore, let your hearts be comforted concerning Zion; for all flesh

            Zion shall not be moved out of her place, notwithstanding her children

            A certain nobleman had a spot of land, very choice; and he said unto his
            servants:
        </span><quote>
            <span>
                Go ye unto my vineyard, even upon this very choice piece of land, and
                plant twelve olive trees;
            </span><verse>45</verse><span>
                and set watchmen round about them, and build a tower, that one may overlook
                the land round about, to be a watchman upon the tower, that mine olive
                trees may not be broken down when the enemy shall come to spoil and take
                upon themselves the fruit of my vineyard.

            Now, the servants of the nobleman went and did as their lord commanded
            them, and planted the olive trees, and built a hedge round about, and set
            watchmen, and began to
            build a tower.
        </span><verse>47</verse><span>
            And while they were yet laying the foundation thereof, they began to say
            among themselves, “And what need hath my lord of this tower?”
        </span><verse>48</verse><span>
            And consulted for a long time, saying among themselves, “What need hath
            my lord of this tower, seeing this is a time of peace?
        </span><verse>49</verse><span>
            Might not this money be given to the exchangers? For there is no need
            of these things.”
        </span><verse>50</verse><span>
            And while they were at variance one with another they became very slothful,

        <verse>51</verse><span>
            And the enemy came by night, and broke down the hedge; and the servants

            their works, and broke down the olive trees.

                Ought ye not to have done even as I commanded you, and—after ye had planted
                the vineyard, and built the hedge round about, and set watchmen upon the
                walls thereof—built the tower also, and set a
                watchman upon the tower, and watched for my vineyard, and not have fallen
                asleep, lest the enemy should come upon you?
            </span><verse>54</verse><span>
                And behold, the watchman upon the tower would have seen the enemy while
                he was yet afar off; and then ye could have made ready and kept the enemy
                from breaking down the hedge thereof, and saved my
                vineyard from the hands of the destroyer.

                Therefore, get ye straightway unto my land; break down the walls of mine

                And inasmuch as they gather together against you, avenge me of mine enemies,

            shall be;
        </span><verse>66</verse><span>
            while the tares shall be bound in bundles, and their bands made strong,
            that they may be burned with
            unquenchable fire.

            Therefore, a commandment I give unto all the churches, that they shall
            continue to gather together unto the places which I have appointed.
        </span><verse>68</verse><span>
            Nevertheless, as I have said unto you in a former commandment, let not
            your gathering be in haste, nor by flight; but let all things be prepared
            before you.
        </span><verse>69</verse><span>
            And in order that all things be prepared before you,
            observe the commandment which I have given concerning these things—
        </span><verse>70</verse><span>
            which saith, or teacheth, to purchase all the lands with money, which
            can be purchased for money, in the region round about the land which I
            have appointed to be the land of Zion, for the beginning of the gathering
            of my saints;
        </span><verse>71</verse><span>
            all the land which can be purchased in Jackson county, and the counties
            round about, and leave the residue in mine hand.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>72</verse><span>
            Now, verily I say unto you, let all the churches gather together all their
            moneys; let these things be done in their time, but not in haste; and observe
            to have all things prepared before you.
        </span><verse>73</verse><span>
            And let honorable men be appointed, even wise men, and send them to
            purchase these lands.
        </span><verse>74</verse><span>
            And the churches in the eastern countries, when they are built up, if
            they will hearken unto this counsel they may buy lands and gather together
            upon them; and in this way they may establish Zion.
        </span><verse>75</verse><span>
            There is even now already in store sufficient,
            yea, even an abundance, to redeem Zion, and establish her waste places,
            no more to be thrown down, were the churches, who call themselves after
            my name, willing to hearken to my voice.

            And again I say unto you, those who have been scattered by their enemies,
            it is my will that they should continue to importune for redress, and redemption,
            by the hands of those who are placed as rulers and are in authority over
            you—
        </span><verse>77</verse><span>
            according to the laws and constitution of the people, which I have suffered
            to be established, and should be maintained for the rights and protection
            of all flesh, according to just and holy principles;
        </span><verse>78</verse><span>
            that every man may act in doctrine and principle pertaining to futurity,
            according to the moral agency which I have given unto him, that every man
            may be accountable for his own sins in the day of judgment.
        </span><verse>79</verse><span>
            Therefore, it is not right that any man should be in bondage one to another.
        </span><verse>80</verse><span>
            And for this purpose have I established the Constitution of this land,
            by the hands of wise men whom I raised up unto this very purpose, and redeemed
            the land by the shedding of blood.

            Now, unto what shall I liken the children of Zion? I will liken them unto

            There was in a city a judge which feared not God, neither regarded man.

            And there was a widow in that city, and she came unto him, saying, “Avenge
            me of mine adversary.”
        </span><verse>84</verse><span>
            And he would not for a while, but afterward he said within himself,
            “Though I fear not God, nor regard man, yet because this widow troubleth
            me I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.”

            Let them importune at the feet of the judge;
        </span><verse>87</verse><span>
            and if he heed them not, let them importune at the feet of the governor;
        </span><verse>88</verse><span>
            and if the
            governor heed them not, let them importune at the feet of the president;
        </span><verse>89</verse><span>
            and if the
            president heed them not, then will the Lord arise and come forth out of
            his hiding place, and in his fury vex the nation;
        </span><verse>90</verse><span>
            and in his hot displeasure, and in his fierce anger, in his time, will
            cut off those wicked, unfaithful, and unjust stewards, and appoint them
            their portion among hypocrites, and unbelievers;
        </span><verse>91</verse><span>
            even in outer darkness, where there is weeping, and wailing, and gnashing
            of teeth.
        </span><verse>92</verse><span>
            Pray ye, therefore, that their ears may be opened unto your cries, that

        </span><verse>94</verse><span>
            that
            wise men and rulers may hear and know that which they have never considered;
        </span><verse>95</verse><span>
            that I may proceed to bring to pass my act, my strange act, and perform

            the wicked, saith your God.

            And again, I say unto you, it is contrary to my commandment and my will
            that my servant Sidney Gilbert should sell my storehouse, which I have appointed
            unto my people, into the hands of mine enemies.
        </span><verse>97</verse><span>
            Let not that which I have appointed be polluted by mine enemies, by the
            consent of those who call themselves after my name;

            for this is a very
            sore and grievous sin against me, and against my people, in consequence

        </span><verse>99</verse><span>
            Therefore, it is my will that my people should claim, and hold claim upon

            them, though they should not be permitted to dwell thereon.
        </span><verse>100</verse><span>
            Nevertheless, I do not say they shall not dwell thereon; for inasmuch

            thereon.
        </span><verse>101</verse><span>
            They shall build, and another shall not inherit it; they shall plant vineyards,

                    On February 17, 1834, at a meeting in Kirtland that included priesthood holders and other members of
                    the church, Joseph oversaw the initial organization of a standing “Presidents Church Council”. Orson Hyde noted in the minutes of that meeting that “many questions have been asked during the time of
                    the organization of this Council and doubtless some errors have been committed, it was, therefore,
                    voted by all present that Brother Joseph should make all necessary corrections by the spirit of
                    inspiration hereafter.” Joseph worked on amending the minutes the following day and presented the
                    revised minutes to a council of sixty-two priesthood holders and church members on February 19.
                    Joseph’s revisions were significant and both added and deleted material from the original minutes. The
                    council unanimously voted to accept the revised minutes as “a form, and constitution of the high
                    Council of the Church of Christ hereafter.” At the February 19 meeting, Joseph reported that “the
                    Council was organized according to the ancient order, and also according to the mind of the Lord.”

            This day a general council of twenty-four high priests assembled at the
            house of Joseph Smith, Jun., by revelation, and proceeded to organize the
            high council of the Church of Christ, which was to consist of twelve high
            priests, and one or three presidents as the case might require.
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>
            The high council was appointed by revelation for the purpose of settling
            important difficulties which might arise in the church, which could not
            be settled by the Church or the bishop’s council to the satisfaction of
            the parties.

        <verse>3</verse><span>
            Joseph Smith, Jun., Sidney Rigdon and Frederick G. Williams were acknowledged
            presidents by the voice of the council; and Joseph Smith, Sen., John Smith,
            Joseph Coe, John Johnson, Martin Harris, John S. Carter, Jared Carter,
            Oliver Cowdery, Samuel H.
            Smith, Orson Hyde, Sylvester Smith, and Luke Johnson, high priests, were
            chosen to be a standing council for the Church, by the unanimous voice
            of the council.
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>
            The above named councilors were then asked whether they accepted their appointments,
            and whether they would act in that office according to the law of heaven,
            to which they all answered that they accepted their appointments, and would
            fill their offices according to the grace of God bestowed upon them.
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>
            The number composing the council, who voted in the name and for the church
            in appointing the above-named councilors were forty- three, as follows:
            nine high priests, seventeen elders, four priests, and thirteen members.
        </span>

    <block>
        <verse>6</verse><span>
            Voted: that the high council cannot have power to act without seven of
            the above-named councilors, or their regularly appointed successors are
            present.
        </span><verse>7</verse><span>
            These seven shall have
            power to appoint other high priests, whom they may consider worthy and
            capable to act in the place of absent councilors.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>8</verse><span>
            Voted: that whenever any vacancy shall occur by the death, removal from
            office for
            transgression, or removal from the bounds of this church government, of
            any one of the above-named councilors, it shall be filled by the nomination
            of the president or presidents, and sanctioned by the voice of a general
            council of high priests, convened for that purpose, to act in the name
            of the Church.

            The president of the church, who is also the president of the council,
            is appointed by
            revelation, and acknowledged in his administration by the voice of the
            Church.
        </span><verse>10</verse><span>
            And it is according to the dignity of his office that he should preside
            over the

        </ddunder><span>
            of the
            Church; and it is his privilege to be assisted by two other presidents,
            appointed after the same manner that he himself was appointed.
        </span><verse>11</verse><span>
            And in case of the absence of one or both of those who are appointed to
            assist him, he has power to preside over the council without an assistant;
            and in case he himself is absent, the other presidents have power to preside
            in his stead, both or either of them.

            Whenever a high council of the Church of Christ is regularly organized,
            according to the foregoing pattern, it shall be the duty of the twelve
            councilors to cast lots by numbers, and thereby ascertain who of the twelve
            shall speak first, commencing with number one and so in succession to number
            twelve.
        </span><verse>13</verse><span>
            Whenever this council convenes to act upon any case, the twelve councilors
            shall consider whether it is a difficult one or not; if it is not, two
            only of the councilors shall speak upon it, according to the form above
            written.
        </span><verse>14</verse><span>
            But if it is thought to be difficult, four shall be appointed; and if
            more difficult, six; but in no case shall more than six be appointed to
            speak.

            The accused, in all cases, has a right to one-half of the council, to
            prevent insult or injustice.
        </span><verse>16</verse><span>
            And the councilors appointed to speak before the council are to present
            the
            case, after the evidence is examined, in its true light before the council;
            and every man is to speak according to equity and justice.
        </span><verse>17</verse><span>
            Those councilors who draw even numbers, that is, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12,

            insult and injustice.
        </span><verse>18</verse><span>
            In all cases the accuser and the accused shall have a
            privilege of speaking for themselves before the council, after the evidences
            are heard and the councilors who are appointed to speak on the case have
            finished their remarks.

            After the evidences are heard, the councilors, accuser and accused have
            spoken, the
            president shall give a decision according to the understanding which he
            shall have of the case, and call upon the twelve councilors to sanction
            the same by their vote.
        </span><verse>20</verse><span>
            But should the remaining councilors, who have not spoken, or any one of
            them, after hearing the
            evidences and pleadings impartially, discover an error in the decision
            of the president, they can manifest it, and the case shall have a re-hearing.
        </span><verse>21</verse><span>
            And if, after a careful re-hearing, any additional light is shown upon
            the case, the decision shall be altered accordingly.
        </span><verse>22</verse><span>
            But in case no additional light is given, the first decision shall stand,
            the majority of the council having power to determine the same.

            In case of difficulty respecting doctrine or principle, if there is not

            The high priests, when abroad, have power to call and organize a council
            after the manner of the foregoing, to settle difficulties, when the parties
            or either of them shall
            request it.
        </span><verse>25</verse><span>
            And the said council of high priests shall have power to appoint one of
            their own number to preside over such council for the time being.
        </span><verse>26</verse><span>
            It shall be the duty of said council to transmit, immediately, a copy
            of their proceedings, with a full statement of the testimony accompanying
            their decision, to the high council of the seat of the First
            Presidency of the Church.
        </span><verse>27</verse><span>
            Should the parties or either of them be dissatisfied with the decision
            of said council, they may appeal to the high council of the seat of the
            First
            Presidency of the Church, and have a re-hearing, which case shall there
            be conducted,
            according to the former pattern written, as though no such decision had
            been made.
        </span><verse>28</verse><span>
            This council of high priests abroad is only to be called on the most difficult
            cases of church
            matters; and no common or ordinary case is to be sufficient to call such
            council.
        </span><verse>29</verse><span>
            The traveling or located high priests abroad have power to say whether

            There is a distinction between the high council or traveling high priests

            of the church shall have power to determine whether any such case, as may

                    On February 24, 1834, Parley P. Pratt and Lyman Wight, who had traveled from Missouri to Kirtland,
                    Ohio, reported to the Kirtland high council on the condition of the Missouri members, most of whom
                    had taken refuge in Clay County. Pratt and Wight asked the high council “how and by what means Zion
                    was to be redeemed from our enemies.” Joseph dictated this revelation that instructed the church how
                    to restore Missouri members to their Jackson County lands. Joseph then volunteered to lead an
                    expedition to Missouri to assist in Zion’s redemption, and thirty or forty others stated they would go
                    with him. Before adjourning, the council appointed Joseph Smith as “Commander in Chief of the
                    Armies of Israel and the leader of those who volunteered to go.”

            Verily I say unto you, my friends, behold, I will give unto you a revelation
            and commandment, that you may know how to act in the discharge of your
            duties concerning the salvation and redemption of your brethren, who have
            been scattered on the land of
            Zion;
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>
            being driven and smitten by the hands of mine enemies, on whom I will
            pour out my wrath without measure in mine own time.
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>
            For I have suffered them thus far, that they might fill up the measure
            of their iniquities, that their cup might be full;
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>
            and that those who call themselves after my name might be chastened for
            a little season with a sore and grievous chastisement, because they did
            not hearken altogether unto the precepts and commandments which I gave
            unto them.

        <verse>5</verse><span>
            But verily I say unto you, that I have decreed a decree which my people
            shall realize, inasmuch as they hearken from this very hour unto the counsel
            which I, the Lord their God, shall give unto them.
        </span><verse>6</verse><span>
            Behold they shall, for I have decreed it, begin to prevail against mine
            enemies from this very hour.
        </span><verse>7</verse><span>
            And by hearkening to observe all the words which I, the Lord their God,
            shall speak unto them, they shall never cease to prevail until the kingdoms
            of the world are subdued under my feet, and the earth is given unto the
            saints, to possess it forever and ever.

            all my words, the kingdoms of the world shall prevail against them.
        </span><verse>9</verse><span>
            For they were set to be a light unto the world, and to be the saviors
            of men;
        </span><verse>10</verse><span>
            and inasmuch as they are not the
            saviors of men, they are as salt that has lost its savor, and is thenceforth
            good for nothing but to be cast out and trodden under foot of men.

            But verily I say unto you, I have decreed that your brethren which have
            been scattered shall return to the lands of their inheritances, and shall
            build up the waste places of Zion.
        </span><verse>12</verse><span>
            For after much tribulation, as I have said unto you in a former commandment,
            cometh the blessing.
        </span><verse>13</verse><span>
            Behold, this is the blessing which I have promised after your tribulations,
            and the tribulations of your brethren—your redemption, and the redemption
            of your brethren, even their restoration to the land of Zion, to be established,
            no more to be
            thrown down.
        </span><verse>14</verse><span>
            Nevertheless, if they pollute their inheritances they shall be thrown
            down; for I will not spare them if they pollute their inheritances.

            Behold, I say unto you, the redemption of Zion must needs come by power;
        </span><verse>16</verse><span>
            therefore,
            I will raise up unto my people a man, who shall lead them like as Moses
            led the children of Israel.
        </span><verse>17</verse><span>
            For ye are the children of Israel, and of the seed of Abraham, and ye

        </span><verse>18</verse><span>
            And as your fathers were led at the first, even so shall the redemption
            of Zion be.

            Verily, verily I say unto you, that my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., is

            spake in the parable which I have
            given unto you.
        </span><verse>22</verse><span>
            Therefore let my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., say unto the strength of
            my house, my young men and the middle aged, “Gather yourselves together
            unto the land of
            Zion,” upon the land which I have bought with money that has been consecrated
            unto me.
        </span><verse>23</verse><span>
            And let all the churches send up wise men with their moneys, and purchase
            lands even as I have commanded them.
        </span><verse>24</verse><span>
            And inasmuch as mine enemies come against you to drive you from my goodly
            land, which I have consecrated to be the land of Zion, even from your own
            lands after these testimonies, which ye have brought before me against
            them, ye shall curse them;
        </span><verse>25</verse><span>
            and whomsoever ye curse, I will curse, and ye shall avenge me of mine
            enemies.
        </span><verse>26</verse><span>
            And my presence shall be with you even in avenging me of mine enemies,
            unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me.

            Let no man be
            afraid to lay down his life for my sake; for whoso layeth down his life
            for my sake shall
            find it again.

            to go up unto the land of Zion, by tens, or by twenties, or by fifties,
            or by an hundred, until they have obtained to the number of five hundred
            of the strength of my house.
        </span><verse>31</verse><span>
            Behold this is my will; ask and ye shall receive; but men do not always

            Therefore, if you
            cannot obtain five hundred, seek diligently that peradventure you may
            obtain three
            hundred.
        </span><verse>33</verse><span>
            And if ye cannot obtain three hundred, seek diligently that peradventure
            ye may obtain one hundred.
        </span><verse>34</verse><span>
            But verily I say unto you, a commandment I give unto you, that ye shall
            not go up unto the land of Zion until you have obtained a hundred of the
            strength of my house, to go up with you unto the land of Zion.

                    United Firm operations in Missouri were abandoned as church members fled, leaving the members of
                    the United Firm with significant debt. Operations in Kirtland were also struggling with financial issues.
                    Facing such problems, members of the Kirtland branch of the United Firm met on 10 April 1834 and
                    decided that the firm should be dissolved.

            with promise immutable and

            should be blessed with a multiplicity of blessings;
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>

            For I, the Lord, have decreed in my heart, that inasmuch as any man belonging

            words, shall break the covenant with which ye are bound, he shall be cursed

            Inasmuch as ye are cut off for transgression, ye cannot escape the buffetings
            of Satan until the day of redemption.
        </span><verse>10</verse><span>
            And I now give unto you power from this very hour, that if any man among
            you, of the order, is found a transgressor and repenteth not of the evil,
            that ye shall deliver him over unto the buffetings of Satan; and he shall
            not have power to bring evil upon you.

        <verse>11</verse><span>
            It is wisdom in me; therefore, a commandment I give unto you, that ye
            shall organize yourselves and appoint every man his stewardship;
        </span><verse>12</verse><span>
            that every man may give an account unto me of the stewardship which is
            appointed unto him.
        </span><verse>13</verse><span>
            For it is expedient that I, the Lord, should make every man accountable,
            as a steward over earthly blessings, which I have made and prepared for
            my creatures.
        </span>

        <verse>14</verse><span>
            I, the Lord, stretched out the heavens, and built the earth, my very handiwork;
            and all things therein are mine.
        </span><verse>15</verse><span>
            And it is my purpose to provide for my saints, for all things are mine.
        </span><verse>16</verse><span>
            But it must needs be done in mine own way; and behold this is the way
            that I, the Lord, have decreed to provide for my saints, that the poor
            shall be exalted, in that the rich are made low.
        </span><verse>17</verse><span>
            For the earth is full, and there is enough and to spare; yea, I prepared
            all things, and have given unto the children of men to be agents unto themselves.
        </span><verse>18</verse><span>
            Therefore, if any man shall take of the abundance which I have made, and
            impart not his portion,
            according to the law of my gospel, unto the poor and the needy, he shall,
            with the wicked, lift up his eyes in hell, being in torment.

        <verse>19</verse><span>
            And now, verily I say unto you, concerning the properties of the order—
        </span><verse>20</verse><span>
            let my servant Sidney Rigdon have appointed unto him the place where he
            now resides, and the lot of the tannery for his stewardship, for his support
            while he is laboring in my vineyard, even as I will, when I shall command
            him.
        </span><verse>21</verse><span>
            And let all things be done according to the counsel of the order, and
            united consent or voice of the order, which dwell in the land of Kirtland.
        </span><verse>22</verse><span>
            And this stewardship and blessing, I, the Lord, confer upon my servant
            Sidney Rigdon
            for a blessing upon him, and his seed after him;
        </span><verse>23</verse><span>
            and I will multiply blessings upon him, inasmuch as he will be humble
            before me.

        <verse>24</verse><span>
            And again, let my servant Martin Harris have appointed unto him, for his
            stewardship, the lot of land which my servant John Johnson obtained in
            exchange for his former inheritance, for him and his seed after him;
        </span><verse>25</verse><span>
            and inasmuch as he is faithful, I will multiply blessings
            upon him and his seed after him.
        </span><verse>26</verse><span>
            And let my servant Martin Harris devote his moneys for the proclaiming
            of my words, according as my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., shall direct.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>27</verse><span>
            And again, let my servant Frederick G. Williams have the place upon which
            he now dwells.
        </span><verse>28</verse><span>
            And let my servant Oliver Cowdery have the lot which is set off joining
            the house, which is to be for the printing office, which is lot number
            one, and also the lot upon which his father resides.
        </span><verse>29</verse><span>
            And let my servants Frederick G. Williams and Oliver Cowdery have the
            printing office and all things that pertain unto it.
        </span><verse>30</verse><span>
            And this shall be their stewardship which shall be appointed unto them.
        </span><verse>31</verse><span>
            And inasmuch as they are
            faithful, behold I will bless, and multiply blessings upon them.
        </span><verse>32</verse><span>
            And this is the beginning of the stewardship which I have appointed them,
            for them and their seed after them.
        </span><verse>33</verse><span>
            And, inasmuch as they are faithful, I will multiply blessings upon them

            building of my houses, which pertains to that inheritance, and those lots
            which have been named for my servant Oliver Cowdery.
        </span><verse>35</verse><span>
            And inasmuch as he is faithful, I will multiply blessings upon him.
        </span><verse>36</verse><span>
            And it is my will that he should sell the lots that are laid off for the
            building up of the city of my saints, inasmuch as it shall be made known
            to him by the voice of the Spirit, and according to the counsel of the
            order, and by the voice of the order.
        </span><verse>37</verse><span>
            And this is the beginning of the stewardship which I have appointed unto
            him, for a blessing unto him and his seed after him.
        </span><verse>38</verse><span>
            And inasmuch as he is faithful, I will multiply a multiplicity of blessings

        <verse>39</verse><span>
            And again, let my servant Newel K. Whitney have appointed unto him the
            houses and lot where he now resides, and the lot and building on which
            the mercantile establishment stands, and also the lot which is on the corner
            south of the mercantile establishment, and also the lot on which the ashery
            is situated.
        </span><verse>40</verse><span>
            And all this I have appointed unto my servant Newel K. Whitney for his
            stewardship, for a blessing upon him and his seed after him, for the benefit
            of the mercantile establishment of my order which I have established for
            my stake in the land of Kirtland.
        </span><verse>41</verse><span>
            Yea, verily, this is the stewardship which I have appointed unto my servant

            and his seed after him.
        </span><verse>42</verse><span>
            And inasmuch as he is faithful in keeping my

            And again, let my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., have appointed unto him
            the lot which is laid off for the building of my house, which is forty
            rods long and twelve wide, and also the inheritance upon which his father
            now resides;
        </span><verse>44</verse><span>
            and this is the beginning of the

            and upon his father.
        </span><verse>45</verse><span>
            For behold, I have reserved an inheritance for his father, for his support;
            therefore he shall be reckoned in the house of my servant Joseph Smith,
            Jun.
        </span><verse>46</verse><span>
            And I will multiply blessings upon the house of my servant Joseph Smith,

            And now, a commandment I give unto you concerning Zion, that you shall
            no longer be bound as a united order to your brethren of Zion, only on
            this wise—
        </span><verse>48</verse><span>
            after you are
            organized, you shall be called the United Order of the Stake of Zion,
            the City of Kirtland. And your brethren, after they are organized, shall
            be called the United Order of the City of Zion.
        </span><verse>49</verse><span>
            And they shall be organized in their own names, and in their own name;
            and they shall do their business in their own name, and in their own names;
        </span><verse>50</verse><span>
            and you shall do your business in your own name, and in your own names.
        </span><verse>51</verse><span>
            And this I have commanded to be done for your salvation, and also for
            their salvation, in consequence of their being
            driven out and that which is to come.
        </span><verse>52</verse><span>
            The covenants being broken through transgression, by covetousness and
            feigned words—
        </span><verse>53</verse><span>
            therefore, you are dissolved as a united order with your brethren, that
            you are not bound only up to this hour unto them, only on this wise, as
            I said, by loan as shall be agreed by this order in council, as your circumstances
            will admit and the voice of the council direct.

    <block>
        <verse>54</verse><span>
            And again, a commandment I give unto you concerning your stewardship which
            I have appointed unto you.
        </span><verse>55</verse><span>
            Behold, all these properties are mine, or else your faith is vain, and
            ye are found hypocrites, and the covenants which ye have made unto me are
            broken;
        </span><verse>56</verse><span>
            and if the properties are mine, then ye are stewards; otherwise ye are
            no stewards.
        </span><verse>57</verse><span>
            But, verily I say unto you, I have appointed unto you to be stewards over
            mine house, even stewards indeed.
        </span><verse>58</verse><span>
            And for this purpose I have commanded you to organize yourselves, even
            to
            print my words, the fulness of my scriptures, the revelations which I
            have given unto you, and which I shall, hereafter, from time to time give
            unto you—
        </span><verse>59</verse><span>
            for the purpose of
            building up my church and kingdom on the earth, and to prepare my people
            for the time when I shall dwell with them, which is nigh at hand.
        </span>

    <block>
        <verse>60</verse><span>
            And ye shall prepare for yourselves a place for a treasury, and consecrate
            it unto my name.
        </span><verse>61</verse><span>
            And ye shall appoint one among you to keep the treasury, and he shall
            be ordained unto this blessing.
        </span><verse>62</verse><span>
            And there shall be a seal upon the treasury, and all the sacred things
            shall be
            delivered into the treasury; and no man among you shall call it his own,
            or any part of it, for it shall belong to you all with one accord.
        </span><verse>63</verse><span>
            And I give it unto you from this very hour; and now see to it, that ye
            go to and make use of the stewardship which I have appointed unto you,
            exclusive of the sacred things, for the purpose of printing these sacred
            things as I have said.
        </span><verse>64</verse><span>
            And the avails of the sacred things shall be had in the treasury, and
            a seal shall be
            upon it; and it shall not be used or taken out of the treasury by any
            one, neither shall the seal be loosed which shall be placed upon it, only
            by the voice of the order, or by
            commandment.
        </span><verse>65</verse><span>
            And thus shall ye preserve the avails of the sacred things in the treasury,
            for sacred and holy purposes.
        </span><verse>66</verse><span>
            And this shall be called the sacred treasury of the Lord; and a seal shall
            be kept upon it that it may be holy and consecrated unto the Lord.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>67</verse><span>
            And again, there shall be another treasury prepared, and a treasurer appointed
            to keep the treasury, and a seal shall be placed upon it;
        </span><verse>68</verse><span>
            and all moneys that you receive in your stewardships, by improving upon
            the properties which I have appointed unto you, in houses, or in lands,
            or in cattle, or in all things save it be the holy and sacred writings,
            which I have reserved unto myself for holy and sacred purposes, shall
            be cast into the treasury as fast as you receive moneys, by hundreds, or
            by fifties, or by twenties, or by tens, or by fives.
        </span><verse>69</verse><span>
            Or in other words, if any man among you obtain five dollars let him
            cast them into the treasury; or if he obtain ten, or twenty, or fifty,
            or an hundred, let him do likewise;
        </span><verse>70</verse><span>
            and let not any among you say that it is his own; for it shall not be
            called his, nor any part of it.
        </span><verse>71</verse><span>
            And there shall not any part of it be used, or taken out of the treasury,
            only by the voice and common consent of the order.
        </span><verse>72</verse><span>
            And this shall be the voice and common consent of the order—that any man
            among you say to the treasurer, “I have need of this to help me in my stewardship”—
        </span><verse>73</verse><span>
            if it be five dollars, or if it be ten dollars, or twenty, or fifty, or
            a hundred, the treasurer shall give unto him the sum which he requires
            to help him in his stewardship—
        </span><verse>74</verse><span>
            until he be found a transgressor, and it is manifest before the council
            of the order plainly that he is an unfaithful and an unwise steward.
        </span><verse>75</verse><span>
            But so
            long as he is in full fellowship, and is faithful and wise in his stewardship,
            this shall be his token unto the treasurer that the treasurer shall not
            withhold.
        </span><verse>76</verse><span>
            But in case of
            transgression, the treasurer shall be subject unto the council and voice
            of the order.
        </span><verse>77</verse><span>
            And in case the treasurer is found an unfaithful and an unwise steward,
            he shall be subject to the council and voice of the order, and shall be
            removed out of his place, and another shall be appointed in his stead.

        <verse>78</verse><span>
            And again, verily I say unto you, concerning your debts—behold it is my
            will that you shall pay all your debts.
        </span><verse>79</verse><span>
            And it is my will that you shall humble yourselves before me, and obtain
            this blessing by your diligence and humility and the prayer of faith.
        </span><verse>80</verse><span>
            And inasmuch as you are diligent and humble, and exercise the prayer of
            faith, behold, I will soften the hearts of those to whom you are in debt,
            until I shall send means unto you for your deliverance.
        </span><verse>81</verse><span>
            Therefore write speedily to New York and write according to that
            which shall be dictated by my Spirit; and I will soften the hearts of
            those to whom you are in debt, that it shall be taken away out of their
            minds to bring affliction upon you.
        </span><verse>82</verse><span>
            And inasmuch as ye are humble and faithful and call upon my name, behold,
            I will give you the victory.
        </span><verse>83</verse><span>
            I give unto you a promise, that you shall be delivered this once out of
            your bondage.
        </span><verse>84</verse><span>
            Inasmuch as you obtain a chance to loan money by hundreds, or thousands,
            even until you shall loan enough to deliver yourself from bondage, it
            is your privilege.
        </span><verse>85</verse><span>
            And pledge the properties which I have put into your hands, this once,
            by giving your names by common consent or otherwise, as it shall seem good
            unto you.
        </span><verse>86</verse><span>
            I give unto you this privilege, this once; and behold, if you proceed
            to do the things which I have laid before you, according to my commandments,
            all these things are mine, and ye are my stewards, and the master will
            not suffer his house to be broken up. Even so.

                    On June 21, the sheriff of Clay County, along with a delegation of men from Clay and Ray counties, met
                    with Joseph Smith and members of the camp, informing them of the great alarm the expedition had
                    caused among western Missouri residents. The following day, Joseph held a council to determine what
                    steps the camp should take. During the council, he dictated this revelation

        <verse>1</verse><span>
            Verily I say unto you who have assembled yourselves together that you
            may learn my will concerning the redemption of mine afflicted people—
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>2</verse><span>
            Behold, I say unto you, were it not for the transgressions of my people,
            speaking
            concerning the church and not individuals, they might have been redeemed
            even now.
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>
            But behold, they have not learned to be obedient to the things which I
            required at their hands, but are full of all manner of evil, and do not
            impart of their substance, as becometh saints, to the poor and afflicted
            among them;
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>
            and are not united according to the union
            required by the law of the celestial kingdom;
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>
            and Zion cannot be built up unless it is by the principles of the law
            of the celestial kingdom; otherwise I cannot receive her unto myself.
        </span><verse>6</verse><span>
            And my people must needs be chastened until they learn obedience, if it
            must needs be, by the things which they suffer.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>7</verse><span>
            I speak not concerning those who are appointed to lead my people, who
            are the first
            elders of my church, for they are not all under this condemnation;
        </span><verse>8</verse><span>
            but I speak concerning my churches abroad—there are many who will say,
            “Where is their God? Behold, he will
            deliver them in time of trouble, otherwise we will not go up unto Zion,
            and will keep our moneys.”
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>9</verse><span>
            Therefore, in consequence of the transgressions of my people, it is expedient
            in me that mine elders should wait for a little season for the redemption
            of Zion—
        </span><verse>10</verse><span>
            that they themselves may be prepared, and that my people may be taught
            more perfectly, and have experience, and know more perfectly concerning
            their duty, and the things which I
            require at their hands.
        </span><verse>11</verse><span>
            And this cannot be brought to pass until mine elders are endowed with
            power from on high.
        </span><verse>12</verse><span>
            For behold, I have prepared a great endowment and blessing to be poured
            out upon them, inasmuch as they are faithful and continue in humility before
            me.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>13</verse><span>
            Therefore it is expedient in me that mine elders should wait for a little
            season, for the redemption of Zion.
        </span><verse>14</verse><span>
            For behold, I do not require at their hands to fight the battles of Zion;
            for, as I said in a former commandment, even so will I fulfil —I will fight
            your battles.
        </span><verse>15</verse><span>
            Behold, the destroyer I have sent forth to destroy and lay waste mine
            enemies;
            and not many years hence they shall not be left to pollute mine heritage,
            and to blaspheme my name upon the lands which I have consecrated for the
            gathering together of my saints.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>16</verse><span>
            Behold, I have commanded my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., to say unto the
            strength of my house, even my warriors, my young men, and middle-aged,
            to gather together for the redemption of my people, and throw down the
            towers of mine enemies, and scatter their watchmen;
        </span><verse>17</verse><span>
            but the strength of mine house have not hearkened unto my words.
        </span><verse>18</verse><span>
            But inasmuch as there are those who have hearkened unto my words, I have
            prepared a
            blessing and an endowment for them, if they continue faithful.
        </span><verse>19</verse><span>
            I have heard their prayers, and will accept their offering; and it is
            expedient in me that they should be brought thus far for a trial of their
            faith.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>20</verse><span>
            And now, verily I say unto you, a commandment I give unto you, that as
            many as have come up hither, that can stay in the region round about, let
            them stay;
        </span><verse>21</verse><span>
            and those that
            cannot stay, who have families in the east, let them tarry for a little
            season, inasmuch as my servant Joseph shall appoint unto them;
        </span><verse>22</verse><span>
            for I will counsel him concerning this matter, and all things whatsoever
            he shall appoint unto them shall be fulfilled.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>23</verse><span>
            And let all my people who dwell in the regions round about be very faithful,
            and
            prayerful, and humble before me, and reveal not the things which I have
            revealed unto them, until it is wisdom in me that they should be revealed.
        </span><verse>24</verse><span>
            Talk not of judgments, neither boast of faith nor of mighty works, but
            carefully gather together, as much in one
            region as can be, consistently with the feelings of the people;
        </span><verse>25</verse><span>
            and behold, I will give unto you favor and grace in their eyes, that you
            may rest in peace and safety, while you are
            saying unto the people, “Execute judgment and justice for us according
            to law, and redress us of our wrongs.”
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>26</verse><span>
            Now, behold, I say unto you, my friends, in this way you may find favor
            in the eyes of the people, until the army of Israel becomes very great.
        </span><verse>27</verse><span>
            And I will soften the hearts of the people, as I did the heart of Pharaoh,
            from time to time, until my servant Joseph
            Smith, Jun., and mine elders, whom I have appointed, shall have time to
            gather up the
            strength of my house,
        </span><verse>28</verse><span>
            and to have sent wise men, to fulfil that which I have commanded concerning
            the purchasing of all the lands in Jackson county that can be purchased,
            and in the adjoining counties round about.
        </span><verse>29</verse><span>
            For it is my will that these lands should be
            purchased; and after they are purchased that my saints should possess
            them according to the laws of consecration which I have given.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>30</verse><span>
            And after these lands are purchased, I will hold the armies of Israel
            guiltless in taking possession of their own lands, which they have previously
            purchased with their moneys,
            and of throwing down the towers of mine enemies that may be upon them,
            and scattering their watchmen, and avenging me of mine enemies unto the
            third and fourth generation of them that hate me.
        </span><verse>31</verse><span>
            But first let my army become very great, and let it be sanctified before
            me, that it may become fair as the sun, and clear as the moon, and that
            her banners may be terrible unto all nations;
        </span><verse>32</verse><span>
            that the kingdoms of this world may be constrained to acknowledge that
            the kingdom of Zion is in very deed the kingdom of our God and his Christ;
            therefore, let us become subject unto her laws.

            Verily I say unto you, it is expedient in me that the first elders of
            my church should
            receive their endowment from on high in my house, which I have commanded
            to be built unto my name in the land of Kirtland.
        </span><verse>34</verse><span>
            And let those commandments which I have given concerning Zion and her

            And it shall be manifest unto my servant, by the voice of the Spirit,
            those that are chosen; and they shall be sanctified;
        </span><verse>37</verse><span>
            and inasmuch as they follow the counsel which they receive, they shall
            have power after many days to
            accomplish all things pertaining to Zion.

        <verse>38</verse><span>
            And again I say unto you, sue for peace, not only to the people that have
            smitten you, but also to all people;
        </span><verse>39</verse><span>
            and lift up an ensign of peace, and make a proclamation of peace unto
            the ends of the earth;
        </span><verse>40</verse><span>
            and make proposals for peace unto those who have smitten
            you, according to the voice of the Spirit which is in you, and all things
            shall work together for your good.
        </span><verse>41</verse><span>
            Therefore, be faithful; and behold, and lo, I am with you even unto the
            end. Even so.

            Use every effort to prevail on the churches to gather to those regions

            Now, my beloved brethren, you will learn by this we have a great work
            to do, and but little time to do it in; and if we do not exert ourselves
            to the utmost in gathering up the
            strength of the Lord's house that this thing may be accomplished,
            behold there remaineth a scourge for the Church, even that they shall be
            driven from city to city, and but few shall remain to receive an inheritance;
            if those things are not kept, there remaineth a
            scourge also; therefore, be wise this once, O ye children of Zion! and
            give heed to my counsel, saith the Lord.

                    Oliver Cowdery wrote “Joseph Smith, Sr., was ordained a president and a patriarch under the hands of
                    his son, Joseph, myself, Sidney Rigdon, and Frederick G. Williams, presidents of the church.” When
                    writing this around September 1835, Oliver gave the date for this event as December 18,1833. Later
                    research has shown the correct date to be December 6, 1834. This date is exactly two years after the
                    reception of Section 86, which stated “the priesthood hath continued through the lineage of your
                    fathers, for ye are lawful heirs according to the flesh.”

            These are the words which fell from his lips while the visions of the Almighty were

            Blessed of the Lord is my father, for he shall stand in the midst of his
            posterity and shall be comforted by their blessings when his is old and
            bowed down with years, and shall be called a prince over them, and shall be numbered among those who hold
            the right of the Patriarchal Priesthood, even the keys of that ministry:
            for he shall assemble together his posterity like unto Adam: and the assembly
            which he called shall be an example for my father, for thus it is written
            of him:

                    Three years previous to the death of Adam, he called Seth, Enos, Cainan,
                    Mahalaleel, Jared, Enoch, and Methuselah, who were all high priests, with
                    the residue of his posterity who were righteous, into the valley of Adam-ondi-Ahman,
                    and there bestowed upon them his last blessing. And the Lord appeared unto
                    them, and they rose up and blessed Adam, and called him Michael, the prince,
                    the archangel. And the Lord administered comfort unto Adam, and said unto
                    him, “I have set thee to be at the head; a multitude of nations shall come
                    of thee, and thou art a prince over them forever.”

            holding the keys of the Patriarchal Priesthood over the kingdom of God
            on earth, even the Church of the Latter Day Saints, and he shall sit in
            the general assembly of Patriarchs, even in council
            with the Ancient of Days when he shall sit and all the Patriarchs with

                    HC: President Joseph Smith, Jr., after making many remarks on the subject of choosing the Twelve,
                    wanted an expression from the brethren, if they would be satisfied to have the Spirit of the Lord
                    dictate in the choice of the Elders to be Apostles; whereupon all the Elders present expressed their
                    anxious desire to have it so…President Joseph Smith, Jr., said that the first business of the meeting was
                    for the Three Witnesses of the
                    Book of Mormon
                    to pray, each one, and then proceed to choose twelve
                    men from the church as Apostles, to go to all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people.

            day of February, 1835, a conference or general meeting was called in Kirtland
            Ohio by the Presidency of the Church of Christ of ‘Latter Day Saints’ in
            order to consult measures relative to the welfare thereof. The Three special
            witnesses of the Book of Mormon
            being present, that part of the revelation given in Fayette, NY, June
            1829 relative to the choosing of twelve apostles, was taken into consideration,
            and it was ascertained that the time had come when they should be chosen.
            Consequently they
            proceeded by the spirit of prophecy and revelation to choose and set apart
            from among all the elders of the church the following persons to fill that
            high and responsible station:

            Dear Brethren, previous to delivering the charge I shall read a part of
            a revelation. It is known to you that previous to the organizing of this
            church in 1830, the Lord gave
            revelations or the church could not have been organized. The people of
            this church were weak in faith compared with the ancients. Those who embarked
            in this cause, were
            desirous to know how the work was to be conducted. They read many things
            in the Book of Mormon
            concerning their duty and the way the great work ought to be done; but
            the minds of men are so constructed that they will not believe without
            a testimony of seeing or hearing. The Lord gave us a revelation that in
            process of time there should be
            Twelve chosen to preach his gospel to Jew and Gentile.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <span>
            Our minds have been on a constant stretch to find who these Twelve were.
            When the time should come, we could not tell, but we sought the Lord by
            fasting and prayer, to have our lives prolonged to see this day, to see
            you, and to take a retrospect of the
            difficulties through which we have passed. but, having seen the day, it
            becomes my duty to deliver to you a charge. And first, a few remarks respecting
            your ministry. You have many revelations put into your hands. Revelations
            to make you acquainted with the
            nature of your mission. You will have difficulties by reason of your visiting
            all the nations of the world. You will need wisdom in a tenfold proportion
            to what you have ever had. You will have to combat all the prejudices of
            all nations.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <note><span>D&amp;C 18</span></note><span>
            He then read the revelation and proceeded to say: Have you desired this
            ministry with all your hearts? If you have desired it, you are called of
            God, not of man, to go into all the world. He read again, from the revelation,
            what the Lord said to the Twelve. Brethren, you have your duty presented
            in this revelation. You have been ordained to the Holy
            Priesthood, You have received it from those who had their power and authority
            from an angel. You are to preach the gospel to every nation. Should you
            in the least degree come short of your duty, great will be your condemnation.
            for the greater the calling, the
            greater the transgression. I, therefore, warn you to cultivate great humility,
            for I know the pride of the human heart. Beware, lest the flatterers of
            the world lift you up. Beware lest your affections are captivated by worldly
            objects. Let your ministry be first. Remember the souls of men are committed
            to your charge, and if you mind your calling you shall
            always prosper.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <span>
            You have been indebted to other men in the first instance for evidence,
            on that you have acted. But it is necessary that you receive a testimony
            from heaven for yourselves, so that you can bear testimony to the truth
            of the Book of Mormon, and that you have seen
            the face of God. That is more than the testimony of an angel. When the
            proper time
            arrives, you shall be able to bear this testimony to the world. When you
            bear testimony that you have seen God, this testimony God will never suffer
            to fall, but will bear you out, although many will not give heed, yet others
            will. You will, therefore, see the necessity of getting this testimony
            from heaven.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <span>
            Never cease striving until you have seen God, face to face. Strengthen
            your faith, cast off your doubts, your sins and all your unbelief and nothing
            can prevent you from coming to God. Your ordination is not full and complete
            till God has laid his hand upon you. We
            require as much to qualify us as did those who have gone before us. God
            is the same. If the Savior in former days laid his hands on his disciples,
            why not in the latter days?
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <span>
            With regard to superiority I must make a few remarks. The ancient Apostles
            sought to be great; but, brethren, lest the seeds of discord be sown in
            this matter, understand
            particularly the voice of the spirit on this occasion. God does not love
            you better or more than others. You are to contend for the faith once delivered
            to the saints. Jacob, you know wrestled till he obtained. It was by fervent
            prayer and diligent search that you have obtained the testimony you are
            now able to bear. You are as one, you are equal in bearing the keys of
            the kingdom to all nations. You are called to preach the gospel of the
            son of God to the nations of the earth. It is the will of your Heavenly
            Father that you proclaim his gospel to the ends of the earth. and the islands
            of the sea.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <span>
            Be zealous to save souls. The soul of one man is as precious as the soul
            of another. You are to bear this message to those who consider themselves
            wise. and such may persecute you, they may seek your life. The adversary
            has always sought the life of the servants of God. You are, therefore,
            to be prepared at all times to make a sacrifice of your lives, should God
            require them in the advancement and building up of his cause. Murmur not
            at God. Be
            always prayerful, be always watchful. You will bear with me while I relieve
            the feelings of my heart. We shall not see another day like this. The time
            has fully come; the voice of the spirit has come to set these men apart.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <span>
            You will see the time when you will desire to see such a day as this,
            and you will not see it. Every heart wishes you peace and prosperity. but
            the scene, with you, will inevitably
            change. Let no man take your bishopric, and beware that you lose not your
            crowns. It will require your whole souls. It will require courage like
            Enoch’s.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <span>
            The time is near when you will be in the midst of congregations, who will
            gnash their teeth upon you. This gospel must roll and will roll till it
            fill the whole Earth. Did I say congregations would gnash upon you? Yea
            I say nations will gnash upon you. You will be considered the worst of
            men. Be not discouraged at this. When God pours out his Spirit, the enemy
            will rage, but God, remember, is on your right hand and on your left. A
            man, though he may be considered the worst, has joy who is conscious that
            he pleases God.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <span>
            The lives of those who proclaim the true gospel will be in danger; this
            has been the case ever since the days of righteous Abel. The same opposition
            has been manifest whenever men came forward to publish the gospel. The
            time is coming when you will be considered the worst by many, and by some
            the best of men. The time is coming when you will be perfectly familiar
            with the things of God. This testimony will make those who do not
            believe your testimony, seek your lives. But there are whole nations who
            will receive your testimony. They will call you good men. Be not lifted
            up when you are called good men. Remember you are young men, and you shall
            be spared, I include the other three. Bear them in mind in your prayers
            carry their cases to a throne of grace. Although they are not present,
            yet you and they are equal. This appointment is calculated to create an
            affection in you, for each other, stronger than death.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <span>
            You will travel to other nations; bear each other in mind. If one or more
            is cast into
            prisons, let the others pray for him, and deliver him by their prayers.
            Your lives shall be in great jeopardy, but the promise of God is that you
            shall be delivered.
        </span>
    </block>

        <span>
            Remember you are not to go to other nations till you receive your endowment.
            Tarry at Kirtland until you are endowed with power from on high. You need
            a fountain of
            wisdom, knowledge, and intelligence such as you never had. Relative to
            the endowment, I make a remark or two, that there be no mistake. The world
            cannot receive the things of God. He can endow you without worldly pomp
            or great parade. He can give you that
            wisdom, that intelligence and that power which characterized the ancient
            Saints and now characterizes the inhabitants of the upper world.
        </span>

    <block>
        <span>
            The greatness of your commission consists in this: you are to hold the
            keys of this ministry. You are to go to the nations afar off; nations that
            sit in darkness. The day is coming when the work of God must be done. Israel
            shall be gathered, The seed of Jacob shall be gathered from their long
            dispersion. There will be a feast to Israel, the elect of God. It is a
            sorrowful tale, but the gospel must be preached and God’s ministers be
            rejected. but where can Israel be found, and receive your testimony, and
            not rejoice? Nowhere. The prophecies are full of great things that are
            to take place in the last days.
            After the elect are gathered out, destruction shall come on the inhabitants
            of the Earth. All nations shall feel the wrath of God, after they have
            been warned by the saints of the Most High. If you will not warn them others
            will and you will lose your crowns.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <span>
            You must prepare your minds to bid a long farewell to Kirtland. even till
            the great day come. You will see what you never expected to see. You will
            need the mind of Enoch or Elijah and the faith of the brother of Jared.
            You must be prepared to walk by faith,
            however appalling the prospect to human view. You, and each of you, should
            feel the force of the imperious mandate, “Son, go labor in my vineyard”
            and cheerfully receive what comes. But in the end you will stand while
            others will fall.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <span>
            You have read in the revelation concerning ordination, “Beware how you
            ordain, for all nations are not like this nation.” They will willingly
            receive the ordinances at your hand to put you out of the way. There will
            be times, when nothing but the angels of God can deliver you out of their
            hand. We appeal to your intelligence, we appeal to your
            understanding, that we have so far discharged our duty to you. We consider
            it one of the greatest condescensions of our Heavenly Father in pointing
            you out to us. You will be stewards over this ministry. We have work to
            do, that no other men can do. You must proclaim the gospel in its simplicity

                    HC: President Smith proposed the following question: “What importance is there attached to the
                    calling of these Twelve Apostles, different from other callings or officers of the Church?” After the
                    question was discussed by Councilors Patten, Young, Smith, and McLellin, President Joseph Smith, Jr.,
                    gave the following decision:

            They are the Twelve Apostles, who are called to the office of the Travelling

            all nations, and to preach the gospel to every creature. This is the power,

                    to be Seventies, from the number of those who went up to Zion with me in the camp; and the
                    following are the names of those who were ordained and blessed at that time, to begin the
                    organization of the first quorum of Seventies, according to the visions and revelations which I have
                    received. The Seventies are to constitute traveling quorums, to go into all the earth, whithersoever the
                    Twelve Apostles shall call them.

                    HC: This afternoon (March 28
                </span><superscript><span>th</span></superscript><span>
                    ) the Twelve met in council, and had a time of general confession. On
                    reviewing our past course we are satisfied, and feel to confess also, that we have not realized the
                    importance of our calling to that degree that we ought; we have been light-minded and vain, and in
                    many things have done wrong. For all these things we have asked the forgiveness of our heavenly
                    Father; and wherein we have grieved or wounded the feelings of the Presidency, we ask their
                    forgiveness. The time when we are about to separate is near; and when we shall meet again, God only
                    knows; we therefore feel to ask of him whom we have acknowledged to be our Prophet and Seer, that
                    he inquire of God for us, and obtain a revelation, (if consistent) that we may look upon it when we are
                    separated, that our hearts may be comforted. Our worthiness has not inspired us to make this request,
                    but our unworthiness. We have unitedly asked God our heavenly Father to grant unto us through His
                    Seer, a revelation of His mind and will concerning our duty the coming season, even a great revelation,
                    that will enlarge our hearts, comfort us in adversity, and brighten our hopes amidst the powers of
                    darkness. In compliance with the above request, I inquired of the Lord, and received for answer the
                    following:

            ORDERS OF THE PRIESTHOOD
        </span>
    </blockheading>
    <block>
        <verse>1</verse><span>
            There are, in the church, two priesthoods, namely, the Melchizedek and
            Aaronic, including the Levitical Priesthood.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>2</verse><span>
            Why the first is called the Melchizedek Priesthood is because Melchizedek
            was such a great high priest.
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>
            Before his day it was called the Holy Priesthood, after the Order of the
            Son of God.
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>
            But out of respect or reverence to the name of the Supreme Being, to avoid
            the too frequent repetition of his name, they, the church, in ancient days,
            called that
            priesthood after Melchizedek, or the Melchizedek Priesthood.
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>
            All other authorities or offices in the church are appendages to this
            priesthood.
        </span><verse>6</verse><span>
            But there are two divisions or
            grand heads—one is the Melchizedek Priesthood, and the other is the Aaronic
            or Levitical Priesthood.
        </span><verse>7</verse><span>
            The office of an elder comes under the priesthood of Melchizedek.
        </span><verse>8</verse><span>
            The
            Melchizedek Priesthood holds the right of presidency, and has power and
            authority over all the offices in the church in all ages of the world,
            to administer in spiritual things.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>9</verse><span>
            The Presidency of the High Priesthood, after the order of Melchizedek,
            have a right to officiate in all the offices in the church.
        </span><verse>10</verse><span>
            High priests after the order of the Melchizedek Priesthood have a right
            to officiate in their own standing, under the direction of the
            presidency, in administering spiritual things, and also in the office
            of an elder, priest (of the Levitical order), teacher, deacon, and member.
        </span><verse>11</verse><span>
            An elder has a right to officiate in his stead when the high priest is
            not present.
        </span><verse>12</verse><span>
            The high priest and elder are to administer in spiritual things, agreeable
            to the covenants and commandments of the church; and they have a right
            to officiate in all these offices of the church when there are no higher
            authorities present.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>13</verse><span>
            The second priesthood is called the Priesthood of Aaron, because it was
            conferred upon Aaron and his seed, throughout all their generations.
        </span><verse>14</verse><span>
            Why it is called the lesser
            priesthood is because it is an appendage to the greater, or the Melchizedek
            Priesthood, and has power in administering outward ordinances.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>15</verse><span>
            The bishopric is the presidency of this priesthood, and holds the keys
            or authority of the same.
        </span><verse>16</verse><span>
            No man has a legal right to this office, to hold the keys of this priesthood,
            except he be a literal descendant of Aaron.
        </span><verse>17</verse><span>
            But as a high priest of the Melchizedek Priesthood has authority to officiate
            in all the lesser offices, he may officiate in the office of bishop when
            no literal descendant of Aaron can be found, provided he is called and
            set apart and ordained unto this power by the hands of the Presidency of
            the Melchizedek Priesthood.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>18</verse><span>
            The power and authority of the higher, or Melchizedek Priesthood, is to
            hold the keys of all the spiritual blessings of the church—
        </span><verse>19</verse><span>
            to have the privilege of receiving the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven,
            to have the heavens opened unto them, to commune with the general assembly
            and church of the Firstborn, and to enjoy the communion and presence of
            God the Father, and Jesus the mediator of the new covenant.

    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>20</verse><span>
            The power and authority of the lesser, or Aaronic Priesthood, is to hold
            the keys of the ministering of angels, and to administer in outward ordinances,
            the letter of the gospel, the baptism of repentance for the remission of
            sins, agreeable to the covenants and

            to its decisions, in order to make their decisions of the same power or

            Wherefore, the office of a bishop is not equal unto it; for the office

            administering all temporal things;
        </span><verse>69</verse><span>
            nevertheless a bishop must be chosen from the High Priesthood, unless
            he is a literal descendant of Aaron;
        </span><verse>70</verse><span>
            for unless he is a literal descendant of Aaron he cannot hold the keys

        <verse>71</verse><span>
            Nevertheless, a high priest, that is, after the order of Melchizedek,
            may be set apart unto the ministering of temporal things, having a knowledge
            of them by the Spirit of truth;
        </span><verse>72</verse><span>
            and also to be a judge in Israel, to do the business of the church, to
            sit in judgment upon transgressors upon testimony as it shall be laid before
            him according to the laws, by the assistance of his counselors, whom he
            has chosen or will choose among the elders of the
            church.
        </span><verse>73</verse><span>
            This is the duty of a bishop who is not a literal descendant of Aaron,
            but has been ordained to the High Priesthood after the order of Melchizedek.
        </span><verse>74</verse><span>
            Thus shall he be a judge, even a common judge among the inhabitants of
            Zion, or in a stake of Zion, or in any branch of the church where he shall
            be set apart unto this ministry, until the borders of Zion are enlarged
            and it becomes necessary to have other bishops or judges in Zion or elsewhere.
        </span><verse>75</verse><span>

            behold, here is wisdom; yea, to be a seer, a revelator, a translator,

            there undertake to regulate the affairs thereof, where there is a standing
            high council; but it is their duty to go abroad and regulate all matters
            relative to the different branches of the Church. When the Twelve are together,
            or a quorum of them, in any church, they will have authority to act independently,
            and make decisions, and those decision will be valid. But where there is
            not a quorum, they will have to do business by the voice of the Church.

            No standing High Council has authority to go into the churches abroad,
            and regulate the matters thereof, for this belongs to the Twelve.

            The Twelve and the Seventy have particularly to depend upon their ministry
            for their support, and that of their families; and they have a right, by
            virtue of their offices, to call upon the churches to assist them.

            President William Phelps arose and spoke in high commendation of the book
            aforenamed and said that he had examined it carefully, that it was well
            arranged and calculated to
            govern the church in righteousness, if followed would bring the members
            to see eye to eye. And further that he had received the testimony from
            God, that the revelations and commandments contained therein are true,
            wherefore, he knew assuredly for himself having received witness from heaven,
            and not from men.

            President John Smith arose and testified his joy, that we have at length
            received the long wished for document to govern the church in righteousness
            and bring the Elders to see eye
            to eye: and further that he was present when some of the revelations contained
            therein were given, and was satisfied they came from God.

            President John Smith then called the vote of the Presidency which was
            carried as follows: that they would receive the book as the rule of their
            faith and practice, and put themselves under the guidance of the same and
            also that they were satisfied with the committee that were chosen to compile
            it, as having discharged their duty faithfully. The vote of the high council
            was then called and carried in confirmation of the above.

            Counsellor Levi Jackman, then arose and said that he had examined as many
            of the
            revelations contained in the book as were printed in Zion and as firmly
            believes them as he does the Book of Mormon or the Bible
            and also the whole contents of the book. He then called for the vote of
            the High Council from Zion, which they gave in favor of the book and also
            of the committee.

            President Phelps, then arose and read the written testimony of the 12
            Apostles in favor of the book and the committee who compiled it. The Presidents
            of the 70 Apostles were then called upon to give their decision on the
            said book. President Leonard Rich, who was appointed to speak for the Seventy
            on this occasion, took the book and said that he had
            examined the Lectures and many of the revelations contained in it, and
            was perfectly satisfied with the same, and further, that he knew that they
            were true by the testimony of the Holy Spirit of God given unto him; he
            then called for the vote of as many of the
            Seventy as were present, which was unanimously given in favor of the book,
            and also that they were perfectly satisfied with the committee that compiled
            it.

            received it and testified that he had examined the Lectures that were contained
            in it, and that he
            believed them beyond a doubt, and the revelations contained in it he knew
            were true, for God had testified to him by his holy Spirit, for many of
            them were given under his roof and in his presence through President Joseph
            committee Smith Jr., the prophet of Lord. He then called for the vote of
            his counsellors, which was given in favor of the book and also of the committee

            place of Edward Partridge, Bishop in Zion. He said that he received it
            with great joy and was perfectly satisfied with the same, and most cordially
            received it as a rule of faith and practice, and also his entire satisfaction
            with the labors of the committee. He also stated that he knew the work
            to be true, then called for the vote of his council which was given in
            favor of the book and of the committee.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <span>
            Elder John Gould then took the book and said that he knew it was true,
            and also the Book of Mormon, because he had received the testimony
            of the Spirit in favor of them,
            and that he was well satisfied with the committee. He called for the voice
            of the Elders, which was given in favor of the work and that they were
            satisfied with the committee.
        </span>
    </block>

        <span>
            Priest Ira Ames took the book and said he was present in the general assembly
            which appointed the committee, and that he was well satisfied with the
            fruit of their labors. He then took the vote of the Priests, who gave their
            voice to receive it, being satisfied with the labors of the committee.

        <span>
            The book being handed to Teacher Erastus Babbitt, he arose and said he
            had been present when one of the revelations contained in it was given,
            and that he received it at the time as coming from God, and that he was
            willing to be governed by the rules contained in the book, for he verily
            believed them to be good, and he was well satisfied with the labors of
            the committee. He also obtained the voice of all the Teachers present
            in favor of the work and the committee.

        <span>
            Deacon William Burgess took the book into his hands stating that he fully
            approved of the matter contained in it, and gave his voice in favor of
            the committee. There being only one Deacon present beside himself, he called
            upon him to give his voice concerning this book, and he said he received
            it with joy and was satisfied with the committee.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <span>
            Brother Thomas Gates then took the book and expressed his satisfaction
            with it, and also called a vote of all the members present, both male and
            female, and they gave a decided voice in favor of it and also of the committee.
            There being a very large portion of the
            church present, all of the above testimonies and votes were voluntarily
            and unhesitatingly given with the utmost freedom of conscience on part
            of the assembly.
        </span>

        <span>

            President W. W. Phelps then read the written testimony of the Twelve,
            as follows:
        </span><quote>
            <span>
                The testimony of the witnesses to the book of the Lord’s commandments,
                which he gave to his church through Joseph Smith, Jr. who was appointed
                by the voice of the
                church for this purpose: we therefore feel willing to bear testimony to
                all the world of mankind, to every creature upon the face of all the earth,
                and upon the islands of the sea, that the Lord has borne record to our
                souls, through the Holy Ghost shed forth
                upon us, that these commandments were given by inspiration of God, and
                are
                profitable for all men, and are verily true. We give this testimony unto
                the world, the Lord being our helper: and it is through the grace of God
                the Father and his Son Jesus Christ, that we are permitted to have this
                privilege of bearing this testimony unto the world, in the which we rejoice
                exceedingly, praying the Lord always, that the
                children of men may be profited thereby.

            According to the custom of all civilized nations, marriage is regulated
            by laws and
            ceremonies: therefore we believe, that all marriages in this church of
            Christ of Latter Day Saints, should be solemnized in a public meeting,
            or feast, prepared for that purpose: and that the solemnization should
            be performed by a presiding high priest, high priest, bishop, elder, or
            priest, not even prohibiting those persons who are desirous to get married,
            of being married by other authority. We believe that it is not right to
            prohibit members of this church from marrying out of the church, if it
            be their determination so to do, but
            such persons will be considered weak in the faith of our Lord and Savior
            Jesus Christ.

            Marriage should be celebrated with prayer and thanksgiving; and at the
            solemnization, the persons to be married, standing together, the man on
            the right, and the woman on the left, shall be addressed, by the person
            officiating, as he shall be directed by the holy Spirit; and if there be
            no legal objections, he shall say, calling each by their names: “You both
            mutually agree to be each other’s companion, husband and wife, observing
            the legal rights
            belonging to this condition; that is, keeping yourselves wholly for each
            other, and from all others, during your lives.” And when they have answered
            “Yes,” he shall pronounce them husband and wife in the name of the Lord
            Jesus Christ, and by virtue of the laws of the country and authority vested
            in him: “May God add his blessings and keep you to fulfill your covenants
            from henceforth and forever.
        </span><break></break><span>
            Amen.”

            The clerk of every church should keep a record of all marriages, solemnized
            in his branch.

        <verse>4</verse><span>
            All legal contracts of marriage made before a person is baptized into
            this church, should be held sacred and fulfilled.

        <span>
            Inasmuch as this church of Christ has been reproached with the crime of
            fornication, and polygamy: we declare that we believe, that one man should
            have one wife; and one woman, but one husband, except in case of death,
            when either is at liberty to marry again.

            It is not right to persuade a woman to be baptized contrary to the will
            of her husband, neither is it lawful to influence her to leave her husband.
            All children are bound by law to obey their parents; and to influence them
            to embrace any religious faith, or be baptized, or leave their parents
            without their consent, is unlawful and unjust. We believe that all persons
            who exercise control over their fellow beings, and prevent them from embracing
            the truth, will have to answer for that sin.

            <block><span>HC: President Oliver Cowdery then read the following article on Governments and Laws in General which was accepted and adopted and ordered to be printed in said book, by a unanimous vote:</span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>1</verse><span>
            We believe that governments were instituted of God for the benefit of
            man; and that he holds men accountable for their acts in relation to them,
            both in making laws and
            administering them, for the good and safety of society.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>2</verse><span>
            We believe that no government can exist in peace, except such laws are
            framed and held inviolate as will secure to each individual the free exercise
            of conscience, the right and control of property, and the protection of
            life.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>3</verse><span>
            We believe that all governments necessarily require civil officers and
            magistrates to enforce the laws of the same; and that such as will administer
            the law in equity and justice should be sought for and upheld by the voice
            of the people if a republic, or the will of the sovereign.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>4</verse><span>
            We believe that religion is instituted of God; and that men are amenable
            to him, and to him only, for the exercise of it, unless their religious
            opinions prompt them to infringe
            upon the rights and liberties of others; but we do not believe that human
            law has a right to interfere in prescribing rules of worship to bind the
            consciences of men, nor dictate forms for public or private devotion; that
            the civil magistrate should restrain crime, but never control conscience;
            should punish guilt, but never suppress the freedom of the soul.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>5</verse><span>
            We believe that all men are bound to sustain and uphold the respective
            governments in which they reside, while protected in their inherent and
            inalienable rights by the laws of such governments; and that sedition and
            rebellion are unbecoming every citizen thus protected, and should be punished
            accordingly; and that all governments have a right to enact such laws as
            in their own judgments are best calculated to secure the public interest;
            at the same time, however, holding sacred the freedom of conscience.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>6</verse><span>
            We believe that every man should be honored in his station, rulers and
            magistrates as such, being placed for the protection of the innocent and
            the punishment of the guilty; and that to the laws all men owe respect
            and deference, as without them peace and
            harmony would be supplanted by anarchy and terror; human laws being instituted
            for the express purpose of regulating our interests as individuals and
            nations, between man and man; and divine laws given of heaven, prescribing
            rules on spiritual concerns, for faith and worship, both to be answered
            by man to his Maker.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>7</verse><span>
            We believe that rulers, states, and governments have a right, and are
            bound to enact laws for the protection of all citizens in the free exercise
            of their religious belief; but we do not believe that they have a right
            in justice to deprive citizens of this privilege, or proscribe them in
            their opinions, so long as a regard and reverence are shown to the laws
            and such
            religious opinions do not justify sedition nor conspiracy.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>8</verse><span>
            We believe that the commission of crime should be punished according to
            the nature of the offense; that murder, treason, robbery, theft, and the
            breach of the general peace, in all respects, should be punished according
            to their criminality and their tendency to evil among men, by the laws
            of that government in which the offense is committed; and for the public
            peace and tranquility all men should step forward and use their ability
            in
            bringing offenders against good laws to punishment.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>9</verse><span>
            We do not believe it just to mingle religious influence with civil government,
            whereby one religious society is fostered and another proscribed in its
            spiritual privileges, and the individual rights of its members, as citizens,
            denied.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>10</verse><span>
            We believe that all religious societies have a right to deal with their
            members for
            disorderly conduct, according to the rules and regulations of such societies;
            provided that such dealings be for fellowship and good standing; but we
            do not believe that any religious society has authority to try men on the
            right of property or life, to take from them this world’s goods, or to
            put them in jeopardy of either life or limb, or to inflict any physical
            punishment upon them. They can only excommunicate them from their society,
            and
            withdraw from them their fellowship.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>11</verse><span>
            We believe that men should appeal to the civil law for redress of all
            wrongs and grievances, where personal abuse is inflicted or the right of
            property or character
            infringed, where such laws exist as will protect the same; but we believe
            that all men are justified in defending themselves, their friends, and
            property, and the government, from the unlawful assaults and encroachments
            of all persons in times of exigency, where immediate appeal cannot be made
            to the laws, and relief afforded.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>12</verse><span>
            We believe it just to preach the gospel to the nations of the earth, and
            warn the righteous to save themselves from the corruption of the world;
            but we do not believe it right to
            interfere with bond-servants, neither preach the gospel to, nor baptize
            them contrary to the will and wish of their masters, nor to meddle with
            or influence them in the least to
            cause them to be dissatisfied with their situations in this life, thereby
            jeopardizing the lives of men; such interference we believe to be unlawful
            and unjust, and dangerous to the peace of every government allowing human
            beings to be held in servitude.

                    An explanatory note written by Cowdery in Patriarchal Blessing Book 1 states that he felt a personal
                    desire to know the mind of the Spirit concerning Joseph Smith. Cowdery “besought the Lord in prayer
                    and fasting,” and, according to Cowdery, God “opened the heavens upon me” and provided the
                    blessing for Joseph Smith in the form of a heavenly vision.

            Blessed of the Lord is my brother, for the integrity of his heart and
            the steadfastness of his soul. Upheld by the arm of the Almighty he shall
            never fall, but shall be strengthened by his right hand till he overcomes.
            Like Jacob of old he shall wrestle with the angel, and as a prince shall
            he have power with God, and shall prevail.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <span>
            Ever faithful to his friends and true to his word, the goodness of the
            Most High shall sustain him, and thousands shall stand up to defend him
            from the hand of his enemies, and put forth the hand and ward off the blow
            were it needful: but ere his foes are aware he shall be hid under the pavilion
            of the Lord Jehovah; for, with the voice of his thunder shall he strike
            terror to their hearts, and as with the wings of an eagle shall my brother
            be carried beyond all harm, by the power of the Anointed. From amid the burning
            bush, like Moses of old, shall he hear the voice, saying, “I am the God
            of thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, I have seen, I have seen, the
            affliction of my people and am come down to
            deliver them. Go, thou, and say to the strength of my house, ‘To your
            tents, O Israel: build up the wastes and raise up the foundation of desolation
            that this generation has made.’”
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <span>
            Thus shall he be honored of the Lord, and thus shall it be recorded of
            him, that the generations to come may bless his name, in Israel, saying,
            “The Lord make thee as Joseph the Seer, who was of the house of Ephraim,
            the brother of Manasseh: the Lord do thee
            good and bring peace and blessings upon thy house as he brought them upon
            the house of Joseph the Seer, who was raised up of a choice vine from the
            stem of Jacob through the root of Joseph, even that Joseph who was separated
            from his brethren.”
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <span>
            For, like Joseph of old shall he be: he shall save the just from desolation,
            by the wise
            counsel of the Almighty; for by his direction shall they gather into store-houses
            and barns, till they overflow with the richness of the fruit of harvest:
            and by this means shall the just be saved from famine, while the nations
            of the wicked are distressed and faint.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <span>
            In due time shall he go forth toward the north, and by the power of his
            word shall the
            deep begin to give way and the ice melt before the sun. By the keys of
            the Kingdom shall he lead Israel into the land of Zion while the house
            of Jacob shouts in the dance and in the song—Joy, O my soul, in that day,
            for thou shalt be with him and bear thy part in the keys which are confirmed
            upon thee for an everlasting priesthood, forever and ever— Joy, O my heart,
            in that day, with thanks giving and with praise, for thou shalt stand with
            him before the hosts of Israel— the lame shall leap as a hart, the old
            shall renew his strength, and the virgin of Israel, with the youth, shall
            exalt the name of our God upon harps and instruments of tense strings.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <span>
            He shall be a sure arrow in the bow of his God, for he shall be hid under
            the shadow of his wing. His loins shall be like iron, girded by the hand
            of the Lord, and his feet shall be swift to execute the commandment of
            the Most High when he shall say, “Destroy.” His name shall be had in everlasting
            remembrance, and his name &lt;seed&gt; after him, for they shall be saved
            to the uttermost.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <span>
            His fame shall be sounded in foreign lands, even to the ends of the earth,
            as well as nigh at home: for in this the times shall change— a prophet
            shall have honor in his own country.

            His learning and wisdom shall astonish the great, for they shall acknowledge
            that by his intelligence he has far surpassed their learning and their
            science. In palaces of governors, rulers and kings shall he be honored,
            even in his person, for God shall give him power to prevail. He shall be
            a lawgiver to Israel and shall teach the house of Jacob the statutes of
            the Most High. His testimony shall shine like the sun, and the weight
            of his influence shall be like the great river that rises on the east of
            the lasting hills, and flows into the great
            deep—so shall his righteousness ever abound.

            treasures hid in the sand. The records of past ages and generations, and
            the histories of ancient days shall he
            bring forth: even the record of the Nephites shall he again obtain, with
            all those hid up by Mormon, and others who were righteous, and many others,
            till he is overwhelmed with knowledge. No precious thing shall slumber
            from his possession, for he shall be covered
            with the most choice of all ages, till his soul shall be satisfied and
            his heart shall say, “Enough, Enough!”

            forever, even the patriarchal; for, behold, he is the first patriarch in
            the last days. He shall sit in the great assembly and general council of
            patriarchs, and execute the will and commandment of God under the
            direction of the Ancient of Days; for he shall have his place and act

            to a knowledge of the truth through his ministry, and he shall be welcomed
            into the presence of kings and the great ones of the earth; for he shall
            claim his place among the nobles of the earth and shall be
            reverenced by them. He shall also be filled with the abundance of the
            fat of the earth: his flocks shall bring forth thousands and tens of thousands:
            his vats shall overflow with wine and oil; his cattle shall increase to
            a multitude; he shall have horses and mules, asses, she asses and dromedaries,
            camels and elephants, and all swift beasts, and when he goes forth in haste
            his chariots shall roar like the approach of an army; he shall have gold
            and silver, precious stones, diamonds, pearls, and the pure platinum, with

            and many shall turn and be his friends in very deed: he shall remain to
            a good old age, even till his head is like the pure wool.
            Behold, there is no end to the vision, of the multiplicity of blessings
            and glories which shall come upon my brother Joseph. He shall possess a
            mansion on high and have an
            inheritance in that city which is like pure gold, even like transparent

            Behold they are under condemnation, because they have not been sufficiently
            humble in my sight, and in consequence of their covetous desires, in that
            they have not dealt equally
            with each other in the division of the moneys which came into their hands.
            Nevertheless some of them dealt equally therefore they shall be rewarded.
            But verily I say unto you they must all humble themselves before me, before
            they will be accounted worthy to
            receive an endowment to go forth in my name unto all nations.

            the wickedness and abominations of men and their shall be none mightier
            than he in his day and generation. Nevertheless if he‌
            repent not speedily he shall be brought low and shall be chastened sorely
            for all his
            iniquities he has committed against me. Nevertheless the sin which he
            hath sinned against me is not even now more grievous than the sin with

            William E. McLellin have sinned against me, and the residue are not sufficiently

                    On the morning of November 9, a man calling himself “Joshua the Jewish minister,” arrived at the
                    home of Joseph Smith in Kirtland. Joseph hosted him for the next two days and invited him to expound
                    on his religious views, but he ultimately denounced his visitor and told him to leave. History of the
                    Church was edited to attribute this quotation to the visitor, whereas the original quotation in context
                    seems to have come from Joseph.

            It is not necessary that God should give us all things at first, or in
            his first commission to us, but in his second. John saw the angel deliver

        </span><ddunder>

            The small lights that God has given are sufficient to lead us out of Babylon

                    present. Council opened by singing and prayer. And I made some remarks as follows:

            The endowment you are so anxious about, you cannot comprehend now, nor
            could
            Gabriel explain it to the understanding of your dark minds; but strive
            to be prepared in your hearts, be faithful in all things, that when we
            meet in the solemn assembly, that is, when such as God shall name out of
            all the official members shall meet, we must be clean every whit. Let us
            be faithful and silent, brethren, and if God gives you a manifestation,
            keep it to yourselves; be watchful and prayerful, and you shall have a
            prelude of those joys that God will pour out on that day. Do not watch
            for iniquity in each other, if you do you will not get an endowment, for
            God will not bestow it on such. But if we are faithful, and live by every
            word that proceeds forth from the mouth of God, I will venture to prophesy
            that we shall get a blessing that will be worth remembering, if we should
            live as long as John the Revelator; our blessings will be such as we have
            not realized before, nor received in this generation. The order of the
            house of God has been, and ever will be, the same,
            even after Christ comes; and after the termination of the thousand years
            it will be the same; and we shall finally enter into the celestial Kingdom
            of God, and enjoy it forever.

            You need an endowment, brethren, in order that you may be prepared and
            able to
            overcome all things; and those that reject your testimony will be damned.
            The sick will be healed, the lame made to walk, the deaf to hear, and the
            blind to see, through your
            instrumentality. But let me tell you, that you will not have power, after
            the endowment to heal those that have not faith, nor to benefit them, for
            you might as well expect to benefit a devil in hell as such as are possessed
            of his spirit, and are willing to keep it; for they are habitations for
            devils, and only fit for his society. But when you are endowed and prepared
            to preach the Gospel to all nations, kindred, and tongues, in their own
            languages, you must faithfully warn all, and bind up the testimony, and
            seal up the law, and the
            destroying angel will follow close at your heels, and exercise his tremendous
            mission upon the children of disobedience; and destroy the workers of iniquity,
            while the Saints will be gathered out from among them, and stand in holy
            places ready to meet the Bridegroom when he comes.

            I feel disposed to speak a few words more to you, my brethren, concerning
            the
            endowment. All who are prepared, and are sufficiently pure to abide the
            presence of the Savior, will see Him in the solemn assembly.

                    the ordinance of anointing our heads with holy oil; also the Councils of Kirtland and Zion met in the
                    two adjoining rooms, and waited in prayer while we attended to the ordinance. I took the oil in my left
                    hand, Father Smith being seated before me, and the remainder of the Presidency encircled him round
                    about. We then stretched our right hands towards heaven, and blessed the oil, and consecrated it in
                    the name of Jesus Christ.

                    anointed his head with the consecrated oil, and sealed many blessings upon him. The Presidency then
                    in turn laid their hands upon his head, beginning at the oldest, until they had all laid their hands upon
                    him, and pronounced such blessings upon his head, as the Lord put into their hearts, all blessing him to
                    be our Patriarch, to anoint our heads, and attend to all duties that pertain to that office.

                    Moses led him in days of old; also the blessings of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. All of the Presidency laid
                    their hands upon me, and pronounced upon my head many prophecies and blessings, many of which I
                    shall not notice at this time. But as Paul said, so say I, let us come to visions and revelations.

            The heavens were opened upon us, and I beheld the celestial kingdom of
            God, and the glory thereof, whether in the body or out I cannot tell.
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>
            I saw the transcendent beauty of the gate through which the heirs of that
            kingdom will enter, which was like unto circling flames of fire;
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>
            also the blazing throne of God, whereon was seated the Father and the
            Son.
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>
            I saw the beautiful streets of that kingdom, which had the appearance
            of being paved
            with gold.
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>
            I saw Father Adam and Abraham; and my father and my mother; my brother
            Alvin, that has long since slept;
        </span><verse>6</verse><span>
            and marveled how it was that he had obtained an
            inheritance in that kingdom, seeing that he had departed this life before
            the Lord had set his hand to gather Israel the second time, and had not
            been baptized for the remission of sins.

                All who have died without a knowledge of this gospel, who would have received
                it if they had been permitted to tarry, shall be heirs of the celestial
                kingdom of God;
            </span><verse>8</verse><span>
                also all that shall die henceforth without a knowledge of it, who would

            </span><verse>9</verse><span>
                for I, the Lord, will judge all men according to their works, according
                to the desire of their hearts.

                        I saw the Twelve Apostles of the Lamb, who are now upon the earth, who
                        hold the keys of this last ministry, in foreign lands, standing together
                        in a circle, much fatigued, with their clothes tattered and feet swollen,
                        with their eyes cast downward, and Jesus standing in their midst, and they
                        did not behold Him. The Savior looked upon them and wept. I also beheld
                        Elder McLellin in the south, standing upon a hill, surrounded by a vast
                        multitude, preaching to them, and a lame man standing before him supported
                        by his
                        crutches; he threw them down at his word and leaped as a hart, by the
                        mighty power of God. Also, I saw Elder Brigham Young standing in a strange
                        land, in the far south and west, in a desert place, upon a rock in the
                        midst of about a dozen men of color, who appeared hostile. He was preaching
                        to them in their own tongue, and the angel of God standing above his head,
                        with a drawn Sword in his hand, protecting him, but he did not see it.

                        the
                        redemption of Zion, and many things which the tongue of man cannot describe
                        in full.

                        Many of my brethren who received the ordinance with me saw glorious visions
                        also.
                        Angels ministered unto them as well as to myself, and the power of the
                        Highest rested
                        upon us, the house was filled with the glory of God, and we shouted Hosanna
                        to God and the Lamb. My scribe also received his anointing with us, and
                        saw, in a vision, the armies of heaven protecting the Saints in their return
                        to Zion, and many things which I saw. The Bishop of Kirtland with his Counselors,
                        and the Bishop of Zion with his Counselors, were present with us, and received
                        their anointings under the hands of Father Smith, and this
                        was confirmed by the Presidency, and the glories of heaven were unfolded
                        to them also.

                        and President Hyrum Smith anointed the head of the President of the Councilors
                        in Kirtland, and
                        President David Whitmer the head of the President of the Councilors of
                        Zion. The President of each quorum then anointed the heads of his colleagues,
                        each in his turn, beginning at the oldest.

                        The visions of heaven were opened to them also. Some of them saw the face
                        of the Savior, and others were ministered unto by holy angels, and the
                        spirit of prophecy and revelation was poured out in mighty power; and loud
                        hosannas, and glory to God in the highest,
                        saluted the heavens, for we all communed with the heavenly host. And I
                        saw in my vision all of the Presidency in the celestial kingdom of God,
                        and many others that were present.

            In the evening met the quorum of High Priests, in the west room of the
            upper loft of the Lord's house, and, in company with my counselors,
            consecrated and anointed the
            counselors of the presidents of the High Priests' quorum, and, having
            instructed them and set the quorum in order, I left them to perform the
            holy anointing, and went to the
            quorum of Elders at the other end of the room. I assisted in anointing
            the counselors of the president of the Elders, and gave the instruction
            necessary for the occasion, and left the
            president and his counselors to anoint the Elders while I should go to
            the adjoining room, and attend to organizing and instructing the quorum
            of the Seventy.

            I found the Twelve Apostles assembled with this quorum, and I proceeded,
            with the quorum of the Presidency, to instruct them, and also the seven
            presidents of the Seventy Elders, to call upon God with up-lifted hands,
            to seal the blessings which had been promised to them by the holy anointing.
            As I organized this quorum, with the presidency in this room, President
            Sylvester Smith saw a pillar of fire rest down and abide upon the heads
            of the quorum, as we stood in the midst of the Twelve.

        <span>
            When the Twelve and the seven presidents were through with their sealing
            prayer, I
            called upon President Sidney Rigdon to seal them with uplifted hands;
            and when he had done this, and cried Hosanna, that all the congregation
            should join him, and shout Hosanna to God and the Lamb, and glory to God
            in the highest. It was done so, and Elder Roger Orton saw a mighty angel
            riding upon a horse of fire, with a flaming sword in his hand, followed
            by five others, encircle the house, and protect the Saints, even the Lord's
            anointed, from the power of Satan and a host of evil spirits, which were
            striving to disturb the Saints.

        <span>
            President William Smith, one of the Twelve, saw the heavens opened, and
            the Lord's host protecting the Lord's anointed.

            President Zebedee Coltrin, one of the seven presidents of the Seventy,
            saw the Savior extended before him, as upon the cross, and a little after,
            crowned with glory upon his head above the brightness of the sun.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <span>
            After these things were over, and a glorious vision which I saw had passed,
            I instructed the seven presidents to proceed and anoint the Seventy, and
            returned to the room of the High Priests and Elders, and attended to the
            sealing of what they had done, with up-lifted hands.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <span>
            After these quorums were dismissed, I retired to my home, filled with
            the Spirit, and my soul cried Hosanna to God and the Lamb, through the
            silent watches of the night; and
            while my eyes were closed in sleep, the visions of the Lord were sweet
            unto me, and His glory was round about me.

                    : Previous notice having been given, the Church of the Latter Day Saints met
                    this day in the House of the Lord to dedicate it to him. The congregation began to assemble before 8
                    o’clock A. M. and thronged the doors until 9, when the Presidents of the church who assisted in seating
                    the congregation, were reluctantly compelled to order the door-keepers to close the doors; every seat
                    and aisle were crowded. One thousand persons were now silently and solemnly waiting to hear the
                    word of the Lord from the mouth of his servants in the sacred desk. President Sidney Rigdon began the
                    services of the day, by reading the 96

                    instruct the understanding, rather than please the ear. He then offered the dedication prayer, which
                    was as follows:

                    HC: Joseph Smith attended meeting in the Lord’s House, assisted the other Presidents of the Church in
                    seating the congregation and then became an attentive listener to the preaching from the stand... In
                    the PM he assisted the other Presidents in distributing the elements of the Lord’s Supper to the
                    church, receiving them from the hands [of the] “Twelve” whose privilege it was to officiate in the
                    sacred desk this day. After having performed this service to his brethren, he retired to the pulpit, the
                    veils being dropped, and bowed himself with Oliver Cowdery, in solemn, but silent prayer to the Most
                    High. After rising from prayer the following vision was opened to both of them.

                    On July 25, 1836, Joseph Smith, Hyrum Smith, Oliver Cowdery, and Sidney Rigdon left Kirtland, Ohio, to
                    travel to the eastern United States, briefly visiting New York City and Boston and staying in Salem,
                    Massachusetts, before returning to Kirtland in mid-September. They arrived in Salem on August 5 and
                    rented a house for three weeks.

                    On April 6, 1837 a solemn assembly was held in the House of the Lord in Kirtland. During this meeting
                    Joseph Smith corrected an error in calling presidents of the Seventy. D&amp;C 107:97 requires that
                    presidents be chosen from among the Seventy, whereas several of the presidents had been chosen
                    from the Elders quorum. When that was done, those Elders had the High Priesthood conferred upon
                    them, in addition to being ordained and set apart to the office of President.

            It was ascertained that all but one or two of the presidents of the Seventies
            were High
            Priests, and when they had ordained and set apart any from the quorums
            of Elders into the quorum of Seventies, they had conferred upon them the
            High Priesthood also. This was
            declared to be wrong, and not according to the order of heaven. New Presidents
            of the Seventies were accordingly ordained to fill the places of such of
            them as were High
            Priests, and the ex-officio presidents and such of the Seventies as had
            been legally ordained to be High Priests were directed to unite with the
            High Priests’ quorum.

                    Of the condition of affairs in Kirtland at this time Eliza Snow wrote: “ A spirit of speculation had crept
                    into the hearts of some of the Twelve, and nearly, if not every quorum was more or less infected. Most
                    of the Saints were poor, and now prosperity was dawning upon them—the Temple was completed and
                    in it they had been recipients of marvelous blessings, and many who had been humble and faithful to
                    the performance of every duty—ready to go and come at every call of the Priesthood, were getting
                    haughty in their spirits, and lifted up in the pride of their hearts. As the Saints drank in the love and
                    spirit of the world, the Spirit of the Lord withdrew from their hearts, and they were filled with pride
                    and hatred toward those who maintained their integrity.”

                    HC: At this time the spirit of speculation in lands and property of all kinds, which was so prevalent
                    throughout the whole nation, was taking deep root in the church. As the fruits of this spirit, evil
                    surmisings, fault-finding, disunion, dissension, and apostasy followed in quick succession, and it
                    seemed as though all the powers of earth and hell were combining their influence in an especial manner to overthrow the church at once, and make a final end. Other banking institutions refused the
                    “Kirtland Safety Society’s” notes. The enemy abroad, and apostates in our midst, united in their
                    schemes, flour and provisions were turned towards other markets, and many became disaffected
                    toward me as though I were the sole cause of those very evils I was most strenuously striving against,
                    and which were actually brought upon us by the brethren not giving heed to my counsel.

            No quorum in the Church was entirely exempt from the influence of those
            false spirits who are striving against me for the mastery; even some of
            the Twelve were so far lost to their high and responsible calling, as to
            begin to take sides, secretly, with the enemy. In
            this state of things, and but a few weeks before the Twelve were expecting
            to meet in full quorum (some of them having been absent for some time),
            God revealed to me that something new must be done for the salvation of

                    HC A new year dawned upon the Church in Kirtland in all the bitterness of the spirit of apostate
                    mobocracy; which continued to rage and grow hotter and hotter, until Elder Rigdon and myself were
                    obliged to flee from its deadly influence, as did the Apostles and Prophets of old, and as Jesus said,
                    “when they persecute you in one city, flee to another.” On the evening of the 12th of January, about
                    ten o’clock, we left Kirtland, on horseback, to escape mob violence, which was about to burst upon us
                    under the color of legal process to cover the hellish designs of our enemies, and to save themselves
                    from the just judgment of the law.

                    We continued our travels during the night, and at eight o’clock on the morning of the 13th, arrived
                    among the brethren in Norton Township, Medina county, Ohio, a distance of sixty miles from Kirtland.
                    Here we tarried about thirty-six hours, when our families arrived; and on the 16th we pursued our
                    journey with our families, in covered wagons towards the city of Far West, in Missouri. We passed
                    through Dayton and Eaton, in Ohio, and Dublin, Indiana; in the latter place we tarried nine days, and
                    refreshed ourselves.

                    Sometime in March 1838, Joseph apparently answered a series of questions regarding the prophecies
                    in Isaiah chapters 11 and 52. The questions and answers were inscribed in Joseph’s “Scriptory Book” by
                    George Robinson. No authorship was attributed, although some of the answers begin with “thus saith
                    the Lord.” Joseph Smith’s authorship is implied.

    </question>
    <block>
        <verse>8</verse><span>
            He had reference to those whom God should call in the last days, who should
            hold the
            power of priesthood to bring again Zion, and the redemption of Israel;
            and to put on her strength is to put on the authority of the priesthood,
            which she, Zion, has a right to by
            lineage; also to return to that power which she had lost.

    </question>

        <verse>10</verse><span>
            We are to understand that the scattered remnants are exhorted to return
            to the Lord from whence they have fallen; which if they do, the promise
            of the Lord is that he will
            speak to them, or give them revelation. See the 6

            verses. The bands of her neck are the curses of God upon her, or the remnants
            of Israel in their scattered condition among the Gentiles.

                    In early 1838, Thomas Marsh and David Patten arrived in Far West, released the presidency, and
                    installed themselves along with Brigham Young as the new presidency of Zion. One week after being
                    sustained as the new presidency, they proceeded to excommunicate Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer,
                    John Whitmer, William Phelps, and others. As members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, Marsh,
                    Patten, and Young were expected to travel, proselytize, and supervise the church conferences and
                    branches outside of Zion and its stakes—that is, outside of the main church congregation in Missouri
                    and any other places designated for gathering. After arriving in Far West, Joseph dictated this
                    revelation to David Patten.

                    In early 1837, about a year before Joseph’s arrival, Zion presidency members William W. Phelps and
                    John Whitmer drew up a plan for a house unto the Lord and appointed a committee to oversee
                    construction. In April 1837, the high council questioned the Zion presidency’s authority to appoint such
                    a committee and even to select the site for the city. When Joseph and Sidney Rigdon visited Far West
                    in November, they participated in a council meeting in which the members resolved to suspend any
                    construction work “till the Lord shall reveal it to be his will to be commenced.”

                    After Joseph moved Far West in March 1838, he and the high council turned their attention to
                    developing Far West as the church’s gathering center. By this time, thousands of Saints were living in
                    Far West and its vicinity and hundreds more were expected from Kirtland within the next few months.

            Let the city, Far West, be a holy and

                    Following Joseph’s departure from Kirtland in January 1838, Williams Marks was designated to preside
                    over the church there and to act as a financial agent for Joseph and Sidney Rigdon in arranging
                    payment of their debts. Newel Whitney was the bishop in Kirtland, overseeing the temporal operations
                    of the church there. It was apparently expected that Marks and Whitney would quickly settle the
                    church’s affairs and then move to Missouri in accordance with the January 12, 1838 revelation
                    directing faithful Saints to relocate there. Yet, neither Whitney nor Marks departed Kirtland with the
                    large group of Saints that left Kirtland on July 6.

                    On June 17, Sidney Rigdon delivered what came to be known as the Salt Sermon. Without naming
                    individuals, he denounced dissenters as salt that had lost its savor and that they must now be trodden under foot.

                    On July 4, Sidney Rigdon delivered a sermon in which he vowed violence on their enemies. “We take
                    God and all the holy angels to witness this day, that we warn all men in the name of Jesus Christ, to
                    come on us no more forever. For from this hour, we will bear it no more, our rights shall no more be
                    trampled on with impunity. The man or the set of men, who attempts it, does it at the expense of their
                    lives. And that mob that comes on us to disturb us; it shall be between us and them a war of
                    extermination; for we will follow them till the last drop of their blood is spilled, or else they will have to
                    exterminate us: for we will carry the seat of war to their own houses, and their own families, and one
                    party or the other shall be utterly destroyed.”

                    On August 6, around 200 Missourians gathered in Gallatin to prevent Mormons from voting in that
                    day’s election. A short skirmish ensued, but concluded without any loss of life.

                    On September 20, about 150 armed men rode into DeWitt and demanded that all Mormons leave the
                    county within ten days. On October 1, the Missourians cut off DeWitt from outside supplies. On
                    October 11, the Mormons agreed to move to Caldwell County.

                    In mid-October, Mormon militias retaliated by plundering houses and stores, burning buildings, and
                    driving non-member women and children into the snowy night. John Corrill wrote, “the love of pillage
                    grew upon them very fast, for they plundered every kind of property they could get a hold of.”

                    On October 19, the day after Gallatin was burned, Thomas Marsh and Orson Hyde left the association
                    of the Church. On October 24, they swore out affidavits concerning the burning and looting in Daviess
                    County. They also reported the existence of the Danite group among the Mormons.

                    On October 25, Mormon and state militias fought the Battle of Crooked River. The Mormons won the
                    battle, but David Patten died from his wounds.

                    Exaggerated reports of the battle combined with the n of Mormons burning and pillaging towns
                    reached Governor Boggs. He mustered 2,500 troops to put down the violence. Perhaps referencing
                    Rigdon’s July 4th sermon that talked of “a war of extermination,” Boggs issued Missouri Executive
                    Order 44, known as the Extermination Order, on October 27, which stated that "the Mormons must be
                    treated as enemies, and must be exterminated or driven from the State if necessary for the public
                    peace.”

                    On October 30, 250 armed men approached Haun’s Mill, where 30 to 40 Latter Day Saint families were
                    living. In the ensuing battle, 17 Latter Day Saints were killed. When survivors reached Far West, the
                    reports of the attack played a significant part in the decision of the Mormons to surrender.

                    In response to the violence over the summer and the extermination order, the Missouri state militia
                    surrounded and laid siege to Far West. The terms for surrender were: the Latter-day Saints were to
                    give up their leaders for trial and to surrender all of their arms; every Mormon who had taken up arms
                    was to sell his property to pay for the damages ; and the Mormons who had taken up arms were to
                    leave the state.

                    Joseph Smith and other leaders were arrested and eventually taken to jail in Liberty, Missouri, to await

                    While imprisoned in Liberty Jail, Joseph wrote a lengthy letter to the Church. Extracts from that letter
                    were later canonized as Section 121, 122, and 123.

        </span><verse>17</verse><span>
            But those who cry

            Their basket shall not be full, their houses and their barns shall perish,

            of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy

            And again, we would suggest for your consideration the propriety of all
            the saints
            gathering up a knowledge of all the facts, and sufferings and abuses put
            upon them by the people of this State;
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>
            and also of all the property and amount of damages which they have sustained,
            both of character and personal injuries, as well as real property;
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>
            and also the names of all persons that have had a hand in their oppressions,
            as far as they can get hold of them and find them out.

            And perhaps a committee can be appointed to find out these things, and
            to take statements and affidavits; and also to gather up the libelous publications
            that are afloat;
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>
            and all that are in the magazines, and in the encyclopedias, and all the
            libelous histories that are published, and are writing, and by whom, and
            present the whole concatenation of diabolical rascality and nefarious and
            murderous impositions that have been practiced
            upon this people—
        </span><verse>6</verse><span>
            that we may not only publish to all the world, but present them to the
            heads of government in all their dark and hellish hue, as the last effort
            which is enjoined on us by our Heavenly Father, before we can fully and
            completely claim that promise
            which shall call him forth from his hiding place; and also that the whole
            nation may be left without excuse before he can send forth the power of
            his mighty arm.

        <verse>7</verse><span>
            It is an imperative duty that we owe to God, to angels, with whom we shall
            be brought to stand, and also to ourselves, to our wives and children,
            who have been made to bow down with grief, sorrow, and care, under the
            most damning hand of murder, tyranny, and oppression, supported and urged
            on and upheld by the influence of that spirit which hath so strongly riveted
            the creeds of the fathers, who have inherited lies, upon the hearts of
            the children, and filled the world with confusion, and has been growing
            stronger and stronger, and is now the very mainspring of all corruption,
            and the whole earth groans under the
            weight of its iniquity.
        </span><verse>8</verse><span>
            It is an iron yoke, it is a strong band; they are the very handcuffs,
            and chains, and shackles, and fetters of hell.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>9</verse><span>
            Therefore it is an imperative duty that we owe, not only to our own wives
            and children, but to the widows and fatherless, whose husbands and fathers
            have been murdered under its iron hand;
        </span><verse>10</verse><span>
            which dark and blackening deeds are enough to make hell itself shudder,
            and to stand aghast and pale, and the hands of the very devil to tremble
            and palsy.

    <block>
        <verse>11</verse><span>
            And also it is an imperative duty that we owe to all the rising generation,
            and to all the pure in heart—
        </span><verse>12</verse><span>
            for there are many yet on the earth among all sects, parties, and
            denominations, who are blinded by the subtle craftiness of men, whereby
            they lie in wait to deceive, and who are only kept from the truth because
            they know not where to find it.

        <verse>13</verse><span>
            Therefore, that we should waste and wear out our lives in bringing to
            light all the hidden things of darkness, wherein we know them; and they
            are truly manifest from heaven—
        </span><verse>14</verse><span>
            these should then be attended to with great earnestness.
        </span><verse>15</verse><span>
            Let no man count them as
            small things; for there is much which lieth in futurity, pertaining to
            the saints, which depends upon these things.

            You know, brethren, that a very large ship is benefited very much by a
            very small helm in the time of a storm, by being kept workways with the
            wind and the waves.
        </span><verse>17</verse><span>
            Therefore, dearly beloved brethren, let us cheerfully do all things that
            lie in our power; and then may we stand still, with the utmost assurance,
            to see the salvation of God, and for his arm to be revealed.

                    Alexander McRae, and Caleb Baldwin were allowed to escape after the sheriff and three of their guards
                    drank whiskey while the fourth guard helped them saddle their horses for the escape. They arrived in
                    Quincy, Illinois, on April 22.

                    Joseph Smith met with the Iowa high council in Montrose, Iowa Territory, to discuss several items of
                    business, including the high council’s desire to have the Saints in Iowa Territory live the law of
                    consecration so that their poor would be cared for. The high council voted to implement the law in
                    Montrose at a meeting held on 6 December 1839. A little over a week later, First Presidency member
                    Hyrum Smith declared that it was “not expedient to go into the law of consecration under Existing
                    circumstances”, but the high council refused to rescind its resolution.

            He said that the law of consecration could not be kept here, and that
            it was the will of the Lord that we should desist from trying to keep it,
            and if persisted in it would produce a perfect abortion, and that he assumed
            the whole responsibility of not keeping it until proposed by himself.

            Afterwards read the parable of the twelve olive trees and said, speaking
            of the Land of Zion, it consists of all North and South America, but that
            any place where the Saints gather is Zion, which every righteous man will
            build up for a place of safety for his
            children. The olive trees are twelve stakes which are yet to be built,
            not the Temple in Jackson as some suppose. For while the twelve stakes
            are being built we will be at peace but the nations of the Earth will be

            The redemption of Zion is the redemption of all North and South America
            and those 12 stake must be built up before the redemption of Zion can take
            place. And those who
            refuse to gather and build when they are commanded to do so cease to be
            saviors of men, and are thenceforth good for nothing but shall be cast
            out and trodden under feet of men…

            We shall build the Zion of the Lord in peace until the servants of that
            Lord shall begin to lay the foundation of a great and high watch tower
            and then shall they begin to say within themselves, “What need hath my
            Lord of this tower seeing this is a time of peace? Etc.”
            Then the enemy shall come as a thief in the night and scatter the servants
            abroad. They will wake up the nations of the whole earth. Even this nation
            will be on the very verge of crumbling to pieces and tumbling to the ground.
            And when the constitution is upon the brink of ruin, this people will be
            the staff upon which the nation shall lean and they shall bear the Constitution
            away from the very verge of destruction.

                Go tell all my servants who are the strength of mine house, my young men

                of the Lord.” Then the kings and queens shall come, then the rulers of the earth
                shall come, then shall all saints come. Yea, the foreign saints shall come to fight
                for the land of my vineyard. For in this thing shall be their safety, and
                they will have no power to choose, but will come as a man fleeth from a
                sudden destruction.

            We had a letter from Elder Hyde, a few days ago, who is in New Jersey,
            and is expecting to leave for England as soon as Elder Page reaches him.
            He requested to know if converted Jews are to go to Jerusalem or to come
            to Zion. I therefore wish you to inform him that converted Jews must come
            here.

            Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you, my servant Joseph Smith, I am well
            pleased with your offering and acknowledgments, which you have made; for
            unto this end have I
            raised you up, that I might show forth my wisdom through the weak things
            of the earth.

            Proclamation to all the nations of the world
        </span>
    </heading>

    <block>
        <verse>2</verse><span>
            Your prayers are acceptable before me; and in answer to them I say unto
            you, that you
            are now called immediately to make a solemn proclamation of my gospel,
            and of this stake which I have planted to be a cornerstone of Zion, which
            shall be polished with the
            refinement which is after the similitude of a palace.
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>
            This proclamation shall be made to all the kings of the world, to the
            four corners thereof, to the honorable president-elect, and the high-minded
            governors of the nation in which you live, and to all the nations of the
            earth scattered abroad.
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>
            Let it be written in the spirit of meekness and by the power of the Holy
            Ghost, which shall be in you at the time of the writing of the same;
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>
            for it shall be given you by the Holy Ghost to know my will concerning
            those kings and authorities,
            even what shall befall them in a time to come.
        </span><verse>6</verse><span>
            For, behold, I am about to call upon them to give heed to the light and
            glory of Zion, for the set time has come to favor her.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>7</verse><span>
            Call ye, therefore, upon them with loud proclamation, and with your testimony,
            fearing them not, for they are as grass, and all their glory as the flower
            thereof which soon falleth, that they may be left also without excuse—
        </span><verse>8</verse><span>
            and that I may visit them in the day of
            visitation, when I shall unveil the face of my covering, to appoint the
            portion of the oppressor among hypocrites, where there is gnashing of teeth,
            if they reject my servants
            and my testimony which I have revealed unto them.
        </span><verse>9</verse><span>
            And again, I will visit and soften their hearts, many of them for your
            good, that ye may find grace in their eyes, that they may come to the light
            of truth, and the Gentiles to the exaltation or lifting up of Zion.
        </span><verse>10</verse><span>
            For the day of my visitation cometh speedily, in an hour when ye think
            not of; and
            where shall be the safety of my people, and refuge for those who shall
            be left of them?
        </span><verse>11</verse><span>
            Awake, O kings of the earth! Come ye, O, come ye, with your gold and your
            silver, to the help of my people, to the house of the daughters of Zion.

            And again, verily I say unto you, let my servant Robert B. Thompson help
            you to write this proclamation, for I am well pleased with him, and that
            he should be with you;
        </span><verse>13</verse><span>
            let him, therefore, hearken to your counsel, and I will bless him with
            a multiplicity of
            blessings; let him be faithful and true in all things from henceforth,
            and he shall be great in mine eyes;
        </span><verse>14</verse><span>
            but let him remember that his stewardship will I require at his hands.

            And again, verily I say unto you, blessed is my servant Hyrum Smith; for
            I, the Lord, love him because of the integrity of his heart, and because
            he loveth that which is right before me, saith the Lord.

            Again, let my servant John C. Bennett help you in your labor in sending
            my word to the kings and people of the earth, and stand by you, even you
            my servant Joseph Smith, in the hour of affliction; and his reward shall
            not fail if he receive counsel.
        </span><verse>17</verse><span>
            And for his love he shall be great, for he shall be mine if he do this,
            saith the Lord. I have seen the work which he hath done, which I accept
            if he continue, and will crown him with blessings and great glory.

    <block>
        <verse>18</verse><span>
            And again, I say unto you that it is my will that my servant Lyman Wight
            should continue in preaching for Zion, in the spirit of meekness, confessing
            me before the world; and I will bear him up as on eagles’ wings; and he
            shall beget glory and honor to himself and unto my name.
        </span><verse>19</verse><span>
            That when he shall finish his work I may receive him unto myself, even
            as I did my servant David Patten, who is with me at this time, and also
            my servant Edward Partridge, and also my aged servant Joseph Smith, Sen.,
            who sitteth with
            Abraham at his right hand, and blessed and holy is he, for he is mine.
        </span>

    <block>
        <verse>20</verse><span>
            And again, verily I say unto you, my servant George Miller is without
            guile; he may be trusted because of the integrity of his heart; and for
            the love which he has to my testimony I, the Lord, love him.
        </span><verse>21</verse><span>
            I therefore say unto you, I seal upon his head the office of a bishopric,
            like unto my servant Edward Partridge, that he may receive the consecrations
            of mine house, that he may administer blessings upon the heads of the poor
            of my people, saith the Lord. Let no man despise my servant George, for

            Let my servant George, and my servant Lyman, and my servant John Snider,
            and others, build a house unto my name, such a one as my servant Joseph
            shall show unto them, upon the place which he shall show unto them also.
        </span><verse>23</verse><span>
            And it shall be for a house for boarding, a house that strangers may come
            from afar to lodge therein; therefore let it be a good house, worthy of
            all acceptation, that the weary traveler may find health and safety while
            he shall contemplate the word of the Lord; and the cornerstone I have appointed
            for Zion.
        </span><verse>24</verse><span>
            This house shall be a healthful habitation if it be built unto my name,
            and if the governor
            which shall be appointed unto it shall not suffer any pollution to come
            upon it. It shall be holy, or the Lord your God will not dwell therein.

                that will come, may come, and bring the box tree, and the fir tree, and
                the pine tree, together with all the precious trees of the earth;

                and with iron, with copper, and with brass, and with

            For a baptismal font there is not upon the earth, that they, my saints,

        </span><verse>30</verse><span>
            for this ordinance belongeth to my house, and cannot be acceptable to
            me, only in the days of your poverty, wherein ye are not able to build
            a house unto me.

        <verse>31</verse><span>
            But I command you, all ye my saints, to build a house unto me; and I grant
            unto you a sufficient time to build a house unto me; and during this time
            your baptisms shall be
            acceptable unto me.
        </span><verse>32</verse><span>
            But behold, at the end of this appointment your baptisms for your dead
            shall not be acceptable unto me; and if you do not these things at the
            end of the appointment ye shall be rejected as a church, with your dead,
            saith the Lord your God.
        </span><verse>33</verse><span>
            For verily I say unto you, that after you have had sufficient time to
            build a house to me, wherein the ordinance of baptizing for the dead belongeth,
            and for which the same was
            instituted from before the foundation of the world, your baptisms for
            your dead cannot be acceptable unto me;
        </span><verse>34</verse><span>
            for therein are the keys of the holy priesthood ordained, that you may
            receive honor and glory.
        </span><verse>35</verse><span>
            And after this time, your baptisms for the dead, by those
            who are scattered abroad, are not acceptable unto me, saith the Lord.
        </span><verse>36</verse><span>
            For it is ordained that in Zion, and in her stakes, and in Jerusalem,
            those places which I have appointed for refuge, shall be the places for
            your baptisms for your dead.

        <verse>37</verse><span>
            And again, verily I say unto you, how shall your washings be acceptable
            unto me, except ye perform them in a house which you have built to my name?
        </span><verse>38</verse><span>
            For, for this cause I commanded Moses that he should build a tabernacle,
            that they should bear it with them in the wilderness, and to build a house
            in the land of promise, that those ordinances might be revealed which had
            been hid from before the world was.
        </span><verse>39</verse><span>
            Therefore, verily I say unto you, that your anointings, and your washings,
            and your baptisms for the dead, and your
            solemn assemblies, and your memorials for your sacrifices by the sons
            of Levi, and for your oracles in your most holy places wherein you receive
            conversations, and your statutes and judgments, for the beginning of the
            revelations and foundation of Zion, and for the glory, honor, and endowment
            of all her municipals, are ordained by the ordinance of my holy house,
            which my people are always commanded to build unto my holy name.

        </span><verse>41</verse><span>
            for I deign to reveal unto my church things which have been kept hid from

            dispensation of the fulness of times.
        </span><verse>42</verse><span>
            And I will show unto my servant Joseph all things pertaining to this house,
            and the priesthood thereof, and the place whereon it shall be built.
        </span><verse>43</verse><span>
            And ye shall build it on the place where you have contemplated building
            it, for
            that is the spot which I have chosen for you to build it.
        </span><verse>44</verse><span>
            If ye labor with all your might, I will consecrate that spot that it shall
            be made holy.

        <verse>45</verse><span>
            And if my people will hearken unto my voice, and unto the voice of my
            servants whom I have appointed to lead my people, behold, verily I say

        <verse>46</verse><span>
            But if they will not hearken to my voice, nor unto the voice of these
            men whom I have appointed, they shall not be blest, because they pollute
            mine holy grounds, and mine holy ordinances, and charters, and my holy
            words which I give unto them.
        </span><verse>47</verse><span>
            And it shall come to pass that if you build a house unto my name, and
            do not do the things that I say, I will not perform the oath which I make
            unto you, neither fulfil the promises which ye expect at my hands, saith
            the Lord.
        </span><verse>48</verse><span>
            For instead of blessings, ye, by your own works, bring
            cursings, wrath, indignation, and judgments upon your own heads, by your
            follies, and by all your abominations, which you practice before me, saith
            the Lord.

            Verily, verily, I say unto you, that when I give a commandment to any
            of the sons of men to do a work unto my name, and those sons of men go
            with all their might and with all they have to perform that work, and cease
            not their diligence, and their enemies come upon them and hinder them from
            performing that work, behold, it behooveth me to
            require that work no more at the hands of those sons of men, but to accept
            of their
            offerings.
        </span><verse>50</verse><span>
            And the iniquity and transgression of my holy laws and commandments I
            will visit upon the heads of those who hindered my work, unto the third
            and fourth
            generation, so long as they repent not, and hate me, saith the Lord God.
        </span><verse>51</verse><span>

            And as I said unto Abraham concerning the kindreds of the earth, even

                    HC: President Joseph Smith, by request of the Twelve Apostles, gave instructions on the doctrine of
                    baptism for the dead, which were listened to with intense interest by the large assembly. The
                    dispensation of the fullness of times will bring to light the things that have been revealed in all former
                    dispensations; also other things that have not been before revealed. He shall send Elijah the Prophet,
                    and restore all things in Christ. President Joseph Smith then announced: There shall be no more
                    baptisms for the dead, until the ordinance can be attended to in the Lord’s House; and the Church shall
                    not hold another General Conference, until they can meet in said house. For thus saith the Lord!
                </span>

            <block>
                <span>
                    In a letter from November 1851, Lyman Wight wrote: The church mostly went from there, Kirtland
                    Ohio, to Missouri where they commenced another house, from which they were driven to the State of
                    Illinois, where we were commanded to build a house or temple to the Most High God. We were to
                    have a sufficient time to build that house, during which time our baptisms for our dead should be
                    acceptable in the river. If we did not build within this time we were to be rejected as a church, we and
                    our dead together. Both the temple and baptizing went very leisurely till the temple was somewhere in
                    building the second story, when Brother Joseph from the stand announced the alarming declaration
                    that baptism for our dead was no longer acceptable in the river. As much to say the time for building
                    the temple had passed by and both we and our dead were rejected together. The church now stands
                    rejected together with their dead. The church being rejected now stands alienated from her God in
                    every sense of the word.

            All the saints that dwell in that land are commanded to come away, for
            this is, “Thus saith the Lord;” therefore pay out no moneys nor properties
            for houses, nor lands, in that
            country, for if you do, you will lose them; for the time shall come that
            you shall not possess them in peace; but shall be scourged with a sore
            scourge; yet your children may possess them; but not until many years shall
            pass away. And as to the organization of that branch of the church, it
            is not according to the spirit and will of God. And as to the
            designs of the leading members of that branch, relative to the printing
            press, and the
            ordaining of Elders, and sending out Elders to beg for the poor, are not
            according to the will of God. And in these things they shall not prosper,
            for they have neglected the House of the Lord, the Baptismal Font, in this
            place, wherein their dead may be redeemed, and the key of knowledge that
            unfolds the dispensation of the fullness of times may be turned,
            and the mysteries of God be unfolded, upon which their salvation, and
            the salvation of the world, and the redemption of their dead depends, for
            thus saith the Lord, “There shall not be a general assembly for a general
            conference assembled together until the House of the Lord shall be finished,
            and the baptismal font;” and if we are not diligent, “the church shall
            be rejected, and their dead also,” saith the Lord.

            Therefore, dear brother, any proceedings otherwise than to put forth their
            hands with their might to do this work, is not according to the will of
            God, and shall not prosper. Therefore tarry not in any place whatever,
            but come forth unto this place from all the world, until it is filled up
            and polished and sanctified according to my word, saith the Lord, come
            ye forth from the ends of the earth, that I may hide you from mine
            indignation that shall scourge the wicked, and then I will send forth
            and build up
            Kirtland, and it shall be polished and refined according to my word. Therefore,
            your doings and your organizations, and designs in printing, or any of
            your councils, are not of me, saith the Lord, even so, Amen.

                    Joseph wrote a letter to John Wentworth, editor of the Chicago Democrat, outlining the history and
                    beliefs of the Church. Included in this letter was a brief history of Joseph’s life and the establishment of
                    the Church, sometimes referred to as the 1842 History. The letter also included a list of beliefs of the
                    Church, which later became the Articles of Faith.

            We have been chastened by the hand of God heretofore for not obeying his
            commands, although we never violated any human law, or transgressed any
            human precept: yet we have treated lightly his commands, and departed from
            his ordinances, and the Lord has chastened us sore, and we have felt his
            arm, and kissed the rod: let us be wise in time to
            come, and ever remember that “to obey is better than sacrifice; and to
            hearken than the fat of rams.” The Lord has told us to build the temple,
            and the Nauvoo House, and that command is as binding upon us as any other;
            and that man who engages not in these things is as much a transgressor
            as though he broke any other command—he is not a doer of God’s will, nor
            a fulfiller of his laws.

            Forasmuch as the Lord has revealed unto me that my enemies, both in Missouri
            and this State, were again in the pursuit of me; and inasmuch as they pursue
            me without a cause, and have not the least shadow or coloring of justice
            or right on their side in the getting up of their prosecutions against
            me; and inasmuch as their pretensions are all founded in
            falsehood of the blackest dye, I have thought it expedient and wisdom
            in me to leave the place for a short season, for my own safety and the
            safety of this people. I would say to all those with whom I have business,
            that I have left my affairs with agents and clerks who will transact all
            business in a prompt and proper manner, and will see that all my debts
            are canceled in due time, by turning out property, or otherwise, as the
            case may require, or as the circumstances may admit of. When I learn that
            the storm is fully blown over, then I will return to you again.

            And as for the perils which I am called to pass through, they seem but
            a small thing to me, as the envy and wrath of man have been my common lot
            all the days of my life; and for what cause it seems mysterious, unless
            I was ordained from before the foundation of the world for some good end,
            or bad, as you may choose to call it. Judge ye for yourselves. God knoweth
            all these things, whether it be good or bad. But nevertheless, deep water
            is what I am wont to swim in. It all has become a second nature to me;
            and I feel, like Paul, to glory in tribulation; for to this day has the
            God of my fathers delivered me out of them all, and will deliver me from
            henceforth; for behold, and lo, I shall triumph over all my enemies, for
            the Lord God hath spoken it.
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>
            Let all the saints rejoice, therefore, and be

            As I stated to you in my letter before I left my place, that I would write
            to you from time to time and give you information in relation to many subjects,
            I now resume the subject of the baptism for the dead, as that subject seems
            to occupy my mind, and press itself upon my feelings the strongest, since
            I have been pursued by my enemies.
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>
            I wrote a few words of revelation to you concerning a recorder. I have
            had a few additional views in relation to this matter, which I now certify.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <span>
            That is, it was declared in my former letter that there should be a recorder,
            who should be eye-witness, and also to hear with his ears, that he might
            make a record of a truth before the Lord.
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>
            Now, in relation to this matter, it would be very difficult for one recorder
            to be present at all times, and to do all the business. To obviate this
            difficulty, there can be a
            recorder appointed in each ward of the city, who is well qualified for
            taking accurate minutes; and let him be very particular and precise in
            taking the whole proceedings,
            certifying in his record that he saw with his eyes, and heard with his
            ears, giving the date, and names, and so forth, and the history of the
            whole transaction; naming also some three individuals that are present,
            if there be any present, who can at any time when called upon certify to
            the same, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be
            established.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>4</verse><span>
            Then, let there be a general recorder, to whom these other records can
            be handed, being attended with certificates over their own signatures,
            certifying that the record they have made is true. Then the general church
            recorder can enter the record on the general church book, with the certificates
            and all the attending witnesses, with his own statement that he verily
            believes the above statement and records to be true, from his knowledge
            of the general character and appointment of those men by the church. And
            when this is done on the general church book, the record shall be just
            as holy, and shall answer the ordinance just the same as if he had seen
            with his eyes and heard with his ears, and made a record of the same on
            the general church book.

        <verse>5</verse><span>
            You may think this order of things to be very particular; but let me tell
            you that it is only to answer the will of God, by conforming to the ordinance
            and preparation that the Lord ordained and prepared before the foundation
            of the world, for the salvation of the dead
            who should die without a knowledge of the gospel.

                    opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life; and the
                    dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according

            You will discover in this quotation that the books were opened; and another
            book was opened, which was the book of life; but the dead were judged out
            of those things which were written in the books, according to their works;
            consequently, the books spoken of must be the books which contained the
            record of their works, and refer to the records
            which are kept on the earth. And the book which was the book of life is
            the record which is kept in heaven; the principle agreeing precisely with
            the doctrine which is commanded you in the revelation contained in the
            letter which I wrote to you previous to my leaving my place—that in all
            your recordings it may be recorded in heaven.

            Now, the nature of this ordinance consists in the power of the priesthood,
            by the
            revelation of Jesus Christ, wherein it is granted that whatsoever you
            bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever you loose on earth
            shall be loosed in heaven. Or, in other words, taking a different view
            of the translation, whatsoever you record on earth shall be recorded in
            heaven, and whatsoever you do not record on earth shall not be
            recorded in heaven; for out of the books shall your dead be judged, according
            to their own works, whether they themselves have attended to the ordinances
            in their own propria persona, or by the means of their own agents, according
            to the ordinance which God has prepared for their salvation from before
            the foundation of the world, according to the
            records which they have kept concerning their dead.

            It may seem to some to be a very bold doctrine that we talk of—a power
            which records or binds on earth and binds in heaven. Nevertheless, in all
            ages of the world, whenever the Lord has given a dispensation of the priesthood
            to any man by actual revelation, or any set of men, this power has always
            been given. Hence, whatsoever those men did in authority, in the name of
            the Lord, and did it truly and faithfully, and kept a proper and faithful
            record of the same, it became a law on earth and in heaven, and could
            not be annulled, according to the decrees of the great Jehovah. This is
            a faithful saying. Who can hear it?

        <verse>12</verse><span>
            Herein is glory and honor, and immortality and eternal life—The ordinance
            of baptism by water, to be immersed therein in order to answer to the likeness
            of the dead, that one principle might accord with the other; to be immersed
            in the water and come forth out of the water is in the likeness of the
            resurrection of the dead in coming forth out of their
            graves; hence, this ordinance was instituted to form a relationship with
            the ordinance of baptism for the dead, being in likeness of the dead.
        </span><verse>13</verse><span>
            Consequently, the baptismal font was instituted as a similitude of the
            grave, and was commanded to be in a place underneath
            where the living are wont to assemble, to show forth the living and the
            dead, and that all things may have their likeness, and that they may accord
            one with another—that which is
            earthly conforming to that which is heavenly, as Paul hath declared, 1
            Corinthians 15:46, 47, and 48:

                    Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural;
                    and afterward that which is spiritual. The first man is of the earth, earthy;
                    the second man is the Lord from heaven. As is the earthy, such are they
                    also that are earthy; and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are
                    heavenly.

            I might have rendered a plainer translation to this, but it is sufficiently
            plain to suit my purpose as it stands. It is sufficient to know, in this
            case, that the earth will be smitten with a curse unless there is a welding
            link of some kind or other between the fathers and the

            It is the baptism for the dead. For we without them cannot be made perfect;
            neither can they without us be made perfect. Neither can they nor we be
            made perfect without those who have died in the gospel also; for it is
            necessary in the ushering in of the dispensation of the fulness of times,
            which dispensation is now beginning to usher in, that a whole and complete
            and perfect union, and welding together of dispensations, and keys, and
            powers, and glories should take place, and be revealed from the days of
            Adam even to the present time. And not only this, but those things which
            never have been revealed from the
            foundation of the world, but have been kept hid from the wise and prudent,
            shall be revealed unto babes and sucklings in this, the dispensation of
            the fulness of times.

                    Wilford Woodruff made notes of a discourse Joseph delivered. Several individuals, including Robert
                    Foster, were promoting building projects on the hill near the temple, which was drawing labor and
                    resources away from the Nauvoo House project. Lucien Woodworth was one of the two architects of
                    the Nauvoo House. He was not a member at the time, and referred to himself as the pagan prophet.

            President Joseph Smith arose and addressed the meeting as a Christian
            prophet and
            addressed for about an hour much to our edification. Many remarks he made
            were plain and pointed some very applicable to Dr Robert D. Foster, which
            he afterwards
            acknowledged to be true. Joseph said the pagan prophet had prophesied
            one thing that was true, viz, that if we did not build the temple &amp;
            Nauvoo House it would prove the ruin of the place. That if we did not build
            those buildings we might as well leave the place. And that it was as necessary
            to build one as the other. And many other things were said much to the
            purpose.

            I was once praying very earnestly to know the time of the coming of the

                Joseph, my son, if thou livest until thou art eighty-five years old, thou

            I should die and thus see his face.
        </span><verse>17</verse><span>

            That of Melchizedek who had still greater power, even power of endless
            life, of which was our Lord Jesus Christ, which also Abraham obtained by
            the offering of his son Isaac, which was not the power of a prophet nor
            apostle nor patriarch only, but of King or Priest to God, to open the windows
            of Heaven, and pour out the peace and law of endless life to man. And no
            man can attain to the joint heirship with Jesus Christ without being
            administered to by one having the same power and authority of Melchizedek.

            Paul is here treating of three different priesthoods, namely the priesthood
            of Aaron,
            Abraham, and Melchizedek. Abraham’s priesthood was of greater power than
            Levi’s, and Melchizedek’s was of greater power than that of Abraham. The
            priesthood of Levi consisted of cursings and carnal commandments and not
            of blessings.

                    Delivered as the funeral sermon for Elder King Follett, Joseph taught many new concepts that
                    contradicted both scripture and his previous teachings. Notable among these are that “God himself
                    was once as we are now” and “we have imagined and supposed that God was God from all eternity. I will refute that idea.” Though never accepted as canon by common consent of the church, nor even
                    published with the scriptures, the concepts in this discourse would become accepted as doctrine and
                    redefine the very nature of God.

                    THE CITY OF NAUVOO, fearless of whose particular case the facts may apply.” After the first issue was published, Joseph Smith and the city council ordered the destruction of the printing press.

                    Joseph Smith, Sr., gave his last recorded patriarchal blessing to Robert D. Foster on July 20, 1840. The
                    blessing promised, “thy enemies will rage, and persecute thee, and foam out their own shame, and
                    shall see the error of their ways, and be constrained to acknowledge their error, and thy truth…thy
                    name is written in heaven, and enrolled amongst the sanctified, thou shall be one of the hundred and
                    forty and four thousand.”

            We all verily believe, and many of us know of a surety, that the religion
            of the Latter Day Saints, as originally taught by Joseph Smith, which is
            contained in the OLD AND NEW TESTAMENTS, BOOK OF COVENANTS, and
            Book of Mormon,
            is verily true; and that the pure principles set forth in those books,
            are the immutable and eternal principles of Heaven, and speaks a language
            which, when spoken in truth and virtue, sinks deep into the heart of every
            honest man. Its precepts are invigorating, and in every sense of the
            word, tend to dignify and ennoble man's conceptions of God and his
            attributes…
        </span>

        <span>
            We are earnestly seeking to explode the vicious principles of Joseph Smith,
            and those who practice the same abominations and whoredoms; which we verily
            know are not accordant and consonant with the principles of Jesus Christ
            and the Apostles; and for that purpose, and with that end in view, with
            an eye single to the glory of God, we have dared to gird on the armor,
            and with God at our head, we most solemnly and sincerely declare that the
            sword of truth shall not depart from the thigh, nor the buckler from the
            arm, until we can enjoy those glorious privileges which nature's God
            and our country's laws have guaranteed to us-freedom of speech, the
            liberty of the press, and the right to worship God as seemeth us good.
            We are aware, however, that we are hazarding every earthly blessing, particularly
            property, and probably life itself, in striking this blow at tyranny and
            oppression: yet notwithstanding we most solemnly declare that no man, or
            set of men combined, shall,
            with impunity, violate obligations as sacred as many which have been violated
            unless reason, justice and virtue have become ashamed and sought the haunts
            of the grave, though our lives be the forfeiture.

            Many of us have sought a reformation in the church, without a public exposition
            of the enormities of crimes practiced by its leaders, thinking that if
            they would hearken to counsel, and shew fruit meet for repentance, it would
            be as acceptable with God, as
            though they were exposed to public gaze…but our petitions were treated
            with contempt; and in many cases the petitioner spurned from their presence
            and particularly by Joseph, who would state that if he had sinned, and
            was guilty of the charges we would charge him with, he would not make acknowledgment,
            but would rather be damned; for it would
            detract from his dignity, and would consequently ruin and prove the overthrow
            of the Church…

            It is absurd for men to assert that all is well, while wicked and corrupt
            men are seeking our destruction, by a perversion of sacred things; for
            all is not well, while whoredoms and all
            manner of abominations are practiced under the cloak of religion. Lo!
            the wolf is in the fold, arrayed in sheep's clothing, and is spreading
            death and devastation among the saints: and we say to the watchmen standing
            upon the walls, cry aloud and spare not, for the day of the Lord is at
            hand…

            to the course pursued last
            Thursday evening, in the case of William and Wilson Law, and Mrs. William
            Law, and
            R.D. Foster, as being unjust and unauthorized by the laws of the Church,
            and consequently null and void; for our law judgeth no man unless he be

            those who approbate a course so unwarranted, unprecedented and so unjust,
            we would say beware lest the unjust measure you meet to your brethren,

            unconditional sealing up to eternal life, against all crimes except that

            reducing those who had the means to give employment to the poor, to the

            applied as the donors expected, but have been used for speculative purposes,
            by Joseph, to gull the saints the better on their arrival at Nauvoo, by
            buying the lands in the vicinity and selling again to them at tenfold advance;
            and

            For all who will have a blessing at my hands shall abide the law

            revelation and commandment through the medium of mine anointed, whom I
            have appointed on the earth to hold this power (and I have appointed unto

            Therefore, if a man marry him a wife in the world, and he marry her not
            by me nor by my word, and he covenant with her so long as he is in the
            world and she with him, their covenant and marriage are not of force when
            they are dead, and when they are out of the world; therefore, they are
            not bound by any law when they are out of the world.
        </span><verse>16</verse><span>
            Therefore, when they are out of the world they neither marry nor are given

            no murder whereby to shed innocent blood, it shall be done unto them in
            all things whatsoever my servant hath put upon them, in time, and through
            all eternity; and shall be of full force
            when they are out of the world; and they shall pass by the angels, and

            Verily, if a man be called of my Father, as was Aaron, by mine own voice,
            and by the voice of him that sent me, and I have endowed him with the keys
            of the power of this
            priesthood, if he do anything in my name, and according to my law and
            by my word, he will not commit sin, and I will justify him.
        </span><verse>60</verse><span>
            Let no one, therefore, set on my servant
            Joseph; for I will justify him; for he shall do the sacrifice which I
            require at his hands for his transgressions, saith the Lord your God.

            And again, as pertaining to the law of the priesthood—if any man espouse
            a virgin, and desire to espouse another, and the first give her consent,
            and if he espouse the second, and they are virgins, and have vowed to no
            other man, then is he justified; he cannot commit adultery for they are
            given unto him; for he cannot commit adultery with that that
            belongeth unto him and to no one else.
        </span><verse>62</verse><span>
            And if he have ten virgins given unto him by this law, he cannot commit
            adultery, for they belong to him, and they are given unto him; therefore
            is he justified.
        </span><verse>63</verse><span>
            But if one or either of the ten virgins, after she is espoused, shall
            be with another man, she has committed adultery, and shall be destroyed;
            for they are
            given unto him to multiply and replenish the earth, according to my commandment,
            and to fulfil the promise which was given by my Father before the foundation
            of the world, and for their exaltation in the eternal worlds, that they
            may bear the souls of men; for herein is the work of my Father continued,
            that he may be glorified.

            And again, verily, verily, I say unto you, if any man have a wife, who
            holds the keys of this power, and he teaches unto her the law of my priesthood,
            as pertaining to these things, then shall she believe and administer unto
            him, or she shall be destroyed, saith the Lord your God; for I will destroy
            her; for I will magnify my name upon all those who
            receive and abide in my law.
        </span><verse>65</verse><span>
            Therefore, it shall be lawful in me, if she receive not this law, for
            him to receive all things whatsoever I, the Lord his God, will give unto
            him,
            because she did not believe and administer unto him according to my word;
            and she then becomes the transgressor; and he is exempt from the law of
            Sarah, who administered unto Abraham according to the law when I commanded
            Abraham to take Hagar to wife.

            To seal the testimony of this book and the
            Book of Mormon, we announce the
            martyrdom of Joseph Smith the Prophet, and Hyrum Smith the Patriarch.
            They were shot in Carthage jail, on the 27
        </span><superscript><span>th</span></superscript><span>
            of June, 1844, about five o’clock p.m., by an armed mob— painted black—of
            from 150 to 200 persons. Hyrum was shot first and fell calmly,
            exclaiming, “I am a dead man!” Joseph leaped from the window, and was
            shot dead in the
            attempt, exclaiming, “O Lord my God!” They were both shot after they were
            dead, in a brutal manner, and both received four balls.
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>
            John Taylor and Willard Richards, two of the Twelve, were the only persons
            in the room at the time; the former was wounded in a savage manner with
            four balls, but has since recovered; the latter, through the providence
            of God, escaped, without even a hole in his robe.

            Joseph Smith, the Prophet and Seer of the Lord, has done more, save Jesus
            only, for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man that ever
            lived in it. In the short space of twenty years, he has brought forth the
            Book of Mormon, which he translated by the gift and power of God, and has been the means
            of publishing it on two continents; has sent the fulness of the everlasting
            gospel, which it contained, to the four quarters of the earth; has brought
            forth the revelations and commandments which compose this book of
            Doctrine And Covenants, and many other wise documents and instructions for the benefit of the
            children of men; gathered many thousands of the Latter-day Saints, founded
            a great city, and left a fame and name that cannot be slain. He lived great,
            and he died
            great in the eyes of God and his people; and like most of the Lord’s anointed
            in ancient times, has sealed his mission and his works with his own blood;
            and so has his brother Hyrum. In life they were not divided, and in death
            they were not separated!

            When Joseph went to Carthage to deliver himself up to the pretended requirements
            of the law, two or three days previous to his assassination, he said:

            <span>
                I am going like a lamb to the slaughter; but I am calm as a summer’s morning;
                I have a conscience void of offense towards God, and towards all men. I
                shall die innocent, and it shall yet be said of me—he was murdered in cold
                blood.

            The same morning, after Hyrum had made ready to go—shall it be said to
            the slaughter?
            yes, for so it was—he read the following paragraph, near the close of
            the twelfth chapter of Ether, in the
            Book of Mormon, and turned down the leaf upon it:
        </span><quote>
            <verse>5</verse><span>
                And it came to pass that I prayed unto the Lord that he would give unto
                the Gentiles grace, that they might have charity. And it came to pass that
                the Lord said unto me:
            </span><quote>
                <span>
                    If they have not charity it mattereth not unto thee, thou hast been faithful;
                    wherefore thy garments shall be made clean. And because thou hast seen
                    thy weakness, thou shalt be made strong, even unto the sitting down in
                    the place which I have prepared in the mansions of my Father.
                </span>
            </quote><span>
                And now I … bid farewell unto the Gentiles; yea, and also unto my brethren
                whom I love, until we shall meet before the judgment-seat of Christ, where
                all men shall know that my garments are not spotted with your blood.

            Hyrum Smith was forty-four years old in February, 1844, and Joseph Smith
            was thirty-eight in December, 1843; and henceforward their names will be
            classed among the martyrs of religion; and the reader in every nation will
            be reminded that the
            Book of Mormon, and this book of
            Doctrine And Covenants
            of the church, cost the best blood of the nineteenth century to bring
            them forth for the salvation of a ruined world; and that if the fire can
            scathe a green tree for the glory of God, how easy it will burn up the
            dry trees to purify the vineyard of
            corruption.

            They were innocent of any crime, as they had often been proved before,

                    Brigham Young received two Catholic priests and gave them a tour of the temple, and while they were
                    in the upper room, proposed to sell the building to the Catholic church. On January 7, 1846, the
                    Catholic church formally declined the offer.

                    and amount of property which the Mormons wish to dispose of to their church, and on what terms it
                    can be bought.

                    knelt around the altar, and dedicated the building to the Most High. We asked his blessing upon our
                    intended move to the west; also asked him to enable us some day to finish the Temple, and dedicate it
                    to him, and we would leave it in his hands to do as he pleased; and to present the building as a
                    monument to Joseph Smith. We asked the Lord to accept the labors of his servants in this land.

                    Reasons advanced: the poverty of the Church, the probability of our enemies getting it, or destroying it if not sold. Vote unanimous in favor of selling.

                    church assets. Fuller wrote in an April 1846 letter, “I am chosen together with two of the Brethren as
                    ‘Trustees-in-Trust’ to dispose of all Church property and to use it in assisting the poor to go [to] the
                    West. We shall about finish the temple by the first of May, when it will be dedicated to the Most High
                    God, after which we think we will sell it. We expect to get $200,000 for it (about one quarter of its

            The Word and Will of the Lord concerning the Camp of Israel in their journeyings
            to the West:
        </span>

    <block>
        <verse>2</verse><span>
            Let all the people of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,
            and those who journey with them, be organized into companies, with a covenant
            and promise to keep all the commandments and statutes of the Lord our God.
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>
            Let the companies be organized
            with captains of hundreds, captains of fifties, and captains of tens,
            with a president and his two counselors at their head, under the direction
            of the Twelve Apostles.
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>
            And this shall be our covenant—that we will walk in all the ordinances
            of the Lord.
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>
            Let each company provide themselves with all the teams, wagons, provisions,
            clothing, and other necessaries for the journey, that they can.
        </span>

        <verse>6</verse><span>
            When the companies are organized let them go to with their might, to prepare
            for those who are to tarry.
        </span><verse>7</verse><span>
            Let each company, with their captains and presidents, decide how many
            can go next spring; then choose out a sufficient number of able-bodied
            and expert men, to take teams, seeds, and farming utensils, to go as pioneers
            to prepare for putting in spring
            crops.
        </span><verse>8</verse><span>
            Let each company bear an equal proportion, according to the dividend of
            their property, in taking the poor, the widows, the fatherless, and the
            families of those who
            have gone into the army, that the cries of the widow and the fatherless
            come not up into the ears of the Lord against this people.
        </span><verse>9</verse><span>
            Let each company prepare houses, and fields for raising grain, for those
            who are to remain behind this season; and this is the will of the Lord
            concerning his people.
        </span><verse>10</verse><span>
            Let every man use all his influence and property to remove this people
            to the place where the Lord shall locate a stake of Zion.
        </span><verse>11</verse><span>
            And if ye do this
            with a pure heart, in all faithfulness, ye shall be blessed; you shall
            be blessed in your flocks, and in your herds, and in your fields, and in
            your houses, and in your families.

            Abraham to Moses, from Moses to Jesus and his apostles, and from Jesus
            and his apostles to Joseph Smith, whom I did call upon by

                    History of Hancock County: About 3 o’clock (in the morning) fire was discovered in the cupola. It had
                    made but little headway when first seen, but spread rapidly, and in a very short period the lofty spire
                    was a mass of flame, shooting high in the air, and illuminating a wide extent of country. It was seen for
                    miles away. The citizens gathered around, but nothing could be done to save the structure. It was
                    entirely of wood except the walls, and nothing could have stopped the progress of the flames. In two
                    hours, and before the sun dawned upon the earth, the proud structure, reared at so much cost—an
                    anomaly in architecture, and a monument of religious zeal—stood with four blackened and smoking
                    walls only remaining.

                    A tornado struck the burned out shell of the temple, partially collapsing the walls. The next day the
                    east and south walls were deemed a safety hazard and demolished, leaving only the west wall of the
                    building. Eventually that was deemed unsafe and demolished, leaving not one stone upon another.

            On the third of October, in the year nineteen hundred and eighteen, I
            sat in my room pondering over the scriptures;
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>
            and reflecting upon the great atoning sacrifice that was made by the Son
            of God, for the redemption of the world;
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>
            and the great and wonderful love made manifest by the Father and the Son
            in the coming of the Redeemer into the world;
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>
            that through his atonement, and by obedience to the principles of the
            gospel, mankind might be saved.

            While I was thus engaged, my mind reverted to the writings of the apostle
            Peter, to the primitive saints scattered abroad throughout Pontus, Galatia,
            Cappadocia, and other parts of Asia, where the gospel had been preached
            after the crucifixion of the Lord.
        </span><verse>6</verse><span>
            I opened the Bible
            and read the third and fourth chapters of the first epistle of Peter,
            and as I read I was greatly impressed, more than I had ever been before,
            with the following passages:

            As I pondered over these things which are written, the eyes of my understanding

            And there were gathered together in one place an innumerable company of
            the spirits of the just, who had been faithful in the testimony of Jesus
            while they lived in mortality;
        </span><verse>13</verse><span>
            and who had offered sacrifice in the similitude of the great sacrifice

            All these had

            They were assembled awaiting the advent of the Son of God into the spirit

            Their sleeping dust was to be restored unto its perfect frame, bone to

            While this vast multitude waited and conversed, rejoicing in the hour
            of their
            deliverance from the chains of death, the Son of God appeared, declaring
            liberty to the
            captives who had been faithful;
        </span><verse>19</verse><span>
            and there he preached to them the everlasting gospel, the doctrine of

            individual sins on conditions of repentance.

            But unto the wicked he did not go, and among the ungodly and the unrepentant

            neither did the rebellious who rejected the testimonies and the

            I marveled, for I understood that the Savior spent about three years in
            his ministry among the Jews and those of the house of Israel, endeavoring
            to teach them the everlasting gospel and call them unto repentance;
        </span><verse>26</verse><span>
            and yet, notwithstanding his mighty works, and miracles, and proclamation
            of the truth, in great power and authority, there were but few who hearkened
            to his voice, and rejoiced in his presence, and received salvation at his
            hands.
        </span><verse>27</verse><span>
            But his ministry among those who were dead was limited to the brief time
            intervening between the crucifixion and his resurrection;
        </span><verse>28</verse><span>
            and I wondered at the words of Peter—wherein he said that the Son of God
            preached unto the spirits in prison, who
            sometime were disobedient, when once the long-suffering of God waited
            in the days of Noah—and how it was possible for him to preach to those
            spirits and perform the
            necessary labor among them in so short a time.

            And as I wondered, my eyes were opened, and my understanding quickened,
            and I perceived that the Lord went not in person among the wicked and the
            disobedient who had rejected the truth, to teach them;
        </span><verse>30</verse><span>
            but behold, from among the righteous, he organized his forces and appointed
            messengers, clothed with power and authority, and commissioned them to
            go forth and carry the light of the gospel to them that were in
            darkness, even to all the spirits of men; and thus was the gospel preached
            to the dead.
        </span><verse>31</verse><span>
            And the chosen messengers went forth to declare the acceptable day of
            the Lord and proclaim liberty to the captives who were bound, even unto
            all who would repent of their sins and receive the gospel.

            Thus was the gospel preached to those who had died in their sins, without
            a knowledge of the truth, or in transgression, having rejected the prophets.
        </span><verse>33</verse><span>
            These were taught faith in God, repentance from sin, vicarious baptism
            for the remission of sins, the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on
            of hands,
        </span><verse>34</verse><span>
            and all other principles of the gospel that were

            according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.
        </span><verse>35</verse><span>
            And so it was made known among the dead, both small and great, the unrighteous
            as well as the faithful, that redemption had been wrought through the sacrifice
            of the Son of God upon the cross.

        </span><verse>37</verse><span>
            that they might carry the message of redemption unto all the dead, unto
            whom he could not go personally, because of their rebellion and transgression,

            Noah, who gave warning of the flood; Shem, the great high priest; Abraham,

            And out of the ground made I, the Lord God, to grow every tree,

            it was good for food. And I, the Lord God, planted the tree of life also

            evil.

            And Adam knew his wife again, and she bare a son, and he called his name
            Seth. And Adam glorified the name of God; for he said, “God hath appointed

            a son, and he called his name Enos.

        <verse>1</verse><span>
            In the land of the Chaldeans, at the residence of my fathers, I, Abraham,
            saw that it was
            needful for me to obtain another place of residence;
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>
            and, finding there was greater happiness and peace and rest for me, I
            sought for the blessings of the fathers, and the right whereunto I should
            be ordained to administer the same; having been myself a follower of righteousness,
            desiring also to be one who possessed great knowledge, and to be a greater
            follower of righteousness, and to possess a greater knowledge, and to be
            a father of many nations, a prince of peace, and desiring to receive instructions,
            and to keep the
            commandments of God, I became a rightful heir, a High Priest, holding
            the right belonging to the fathers.
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>
            It was conferred upon me from the fathers; it came down from the fathers,
            from the beginning of time, yea, even from the beginning, or before the
            foundation of the earth, down to the present time, even the right of the
            firstborn, or the first man, who is Adam, or first father, through the
            fathers unto me.
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>
            I sought for mine appointment unto the Priesthood according to the appointment
            of God unto the fathers concerning the seed.

            My fathers, having turned from their righteousness, and from the holy
            commandments which the Lord their God had given unto them, unto the worshiping
            of the gods of the heathen, utterly refused to hearken to my voice;
        </span><verse>6</verse><span>
            for their hearts were set to do evil, and were wholly turned to the god
            of Elkenah, and the god of Libnah, and the god of
            Mahmackrah, and the god of Korash, and the god of Pharaoh, king of Egypt;
        </span><verse>7</verse><span>
            therefore they turned their hearts to the sacrifice of the heathen in
            offering up their children unto these dumb idols, and hearkened not unto
            my voice, but endeavored to take away my life by the hand of the priest
            of Elkenah.

            The priest of Elkenah was also the priest of Pharaoh.
        </span><verse>8</verse><span>
            Now, at this time it was the custom of the priest of Pharaoh, the king
            of Egypt, to offer up upon the altar which was built in the land of Chaldea,
            for the offering unto these strange gods, men, women, and children.
        </span><verse>9</verse><span>
            And it came to pass that the priest made an offering unto the god of Pharaoh,
            and also
            unto the god of Shagreel, even after the manner of the Egyptians. Now
            the god of
            Shagreel was the sun.
        </span><verse>10</verse><span>
            Even the thank-offering of a child did the priest of Pharaoh offer upon
            the altar which stood by the hill called Potiphar’s Hill, at the head of
            the plain of Olishem.
        </span><verse>11</verse><span>
            Now, this priest had offered upon this altar three virgins at one time,
            who were the daughters of Onitah, one of the royal descent directly from the
            loins of Ham. These virgins were offered up because of their virtue; they
            would not bow down to worship gods of wood or of stone, therefore they
            were killed upon this altar, and it was done after the manner of the Egyptians.

            And it came to pass that the priests laid violence upon me, that they
            might slay me also, as they did those virgins upon this altar. And that
            you may have a knowledge of this altar, I will refer you to the representation
            at the commencement of this record.
        </span><verse>13</verse><span>
            It was made after the form of a bedstead, such as was had among the Chaldeans,
            and it stood before the gods of Elkenah, Libnah, Mahmackrah, Korash, and
            also a god like unto that of Pharaoh, king of Egypt.
        </span><verse>14</verse><span>
            That you may have an understanding of these gods, I have given you the
            fashion of them in the figures at the beginning, which manner of figures
            is called by the Chaldeans Rahleenos, which signifies hieroglyphics.

                    house, and from all thy kinsfolk, into a strange land which thou knowest

                    and this because they have turned their hearts away from me, to worship

            Behold, Potiphar’s Hill was in the land of Ur, of Chaldea. And the Lord
            broke down the altar of Elkenah, and of the gods of the land, and utterly
            destroyed them, and smote the priest that he died; and there was great
            mourning in Chaldea, and also in the court of
            Pharaoh; which Pharaoh signifies king by royal blood.

                    Now this king of Egypt was a descendant from the loins of Ham, and was
                    a partaker of the blood of the Canaanites by birth.
                </span><verse>22</verse><span>
                    From this descent sprang all the Egyptians, and thus the blood of the
                    Canaanites was preserved in the land.
                </span><verse>23</verse><span>
                    The land of Egypt being first
                    discovered by a woman, who was the daughter of Ham, and the daughter of
                    Egyptus, which in the Chaldean signifies Egypt, which signifies that which
                    is forbidden;

                    when this woman discovered the land it was under water, who afterward
                    settled her sons in it; and thus, from Ham, sprang that race which preserved

                    Now the first government of Egypt was established by Pharaoh, the eldest
                    son of Egyptus, the daughter of Ham, and it was after the manner of the government
                    of Ham, which was patriarchal.
                </span><verse>26</verse><span>
                    Pharaoh, being a righteous man, established his kingdom and judged his
                    people wisely and justly all his days, seeking earnestly to imitate that
                    order
                    established by the fathers in the first generations, in the days of the
                    first patriarchal reign, even in the reign of Adam, and also of Noah, his
                    father, who blessed him with the
                    blessings of the earth, and with the blessings of wisdom, but cursed him
                    as pertaining to the Priesthood.

                    Now, Pharaoh being of that lineage by which he could not have the

                    from Noah, through Ham, therefore my father was led away by their idolatry;

            Now, after the priest of Elkenah was smitten that he died, there came
            a fulfilment of those things which were said unto me concerning the land
            of Chaldea, that there should be a famine in the land.
        </span><verse>30</verse><span>
            Accordingly a famine prevailed throughout all the land of Chaldea, and
            my father was sorely tormented because of the famine, and he repented of
            the evil which he had determined against me, to take away my life.

            But the records of the fathers, even the patriarchs, concerning the right
            of Priesthood, the Lord my God preserved in mine own hands; therefore a
            knowledge of the beginning of the creation, and also of the planets, and
            of the stars, as they were made known unto the
            fathers, have I kept even unto this day, and I shall endeavor to write
            some of these things upon this record, for the benefit of my posterity
            that shall come after me.

            Now the Lord God caused the famine to wax sore in the land of Ur, insomuch
            that Haran, my brother, died; but Terah, my father, yet lived in the land

            And it came to pass that I, Abraham, took Sarai to wife, and Nahor, my

                The planet which is the lesser light, lesser than that which is to rule
                the day, even the night, is above or greater than that upon which thou
                standest in point of reckoning, for it moveth in order more slow; this
                is in order because it standeth above the earth upon which thou standest,
                therefore the reckoning of its time is not so many as to its number of
                days, and of months, and of years.

                    Now, Abraham, these two facts exist, behold thine eyes see it; it is given
                    unto thee to know the times of reckoning, and the set time, yea, the set
                    time of the earth upon
                    which thou standest, and the set time of the greater light which is set
                    to rule the day, and the set time of the lesser light which is set to rule
                    the night.

                    Now the set time of the lesser light is a longer time as to its reckoning
                    than the reckoning of the time of the earth upon which thou standest.

            I was born in the town of Sharon in the State of Vermont, North America
            on the twenty- third day of December AD 1805 of goodly parents who spared
            no pains to instructing me in the Christian religion. At the age of about
            ten years my Father Joseph Smith, Sr. moved to Palmyra, Ontario County
            in the State of New York and being in indigent
            circumstances were obliged to labor hard for the support of a large family
            having nine
            children. And as it required their exertions of all that were able to
            render any assistance for the support of the family therefore we were deprived
            of the benefit of an education.
            Suffice it to say I was merely instructed in reading and writing and the
            ground rules of arithmetic which constituted my whole literary acquirements.

            At about the age of twelve years my mind become seriously impressed with
            regard to the all-important concerns of for the well fare of my immortal
            soul which led me to searching the scriptures believing as I was taught,
            that they contained the word of God. Thus
            applying myself to them and my intimate acquaintance with those of different
            denominations led me to marvel exceedingly. For I discovered that they
            did not adorn their profession by a holy walk and Godly conversation agreeable
            to what I found contained in that sacred depository. This was a grief to
            my soul thus from the age of twelve years to fifteen.

            I pondered many things in my heart concerning the situation of the world,
            of mankind, the contentions, and divisions, the wickedness, and abominations,
            and the darkness which pervaded the of the minds of mankind. My mind become
            exceedingly distressed for I become convicted of my sins and by searching
            the scriptures I found that mankind did not come unto the Lord but that
            they had apostatized from the true and living faith and there was no society
            or denomination that built upon the gospel of Jesus Christ as recorded
            in the New Testament. And I felt to mourn for my own sins and for the sins
            of the world for I learned in the scriptures that God was the same yesterday
            to day and forever that he was no respecter to persons for he was God.
            For I looked upon the sun the glorious luminary of the earth and also the
            moon rolling in their majesty through the heavens and also the stars shining
            in their courses and the earth also upon which I stood and the beast of
            the field and the fowls of heaven and the fish of the waters and also man
            walking forth upon the face of the earth in majesty and in the strength
            of beauty whose power and intelligence in governing the things which are
            so exceeding great and marvelous even in the likeness of
            him who created them and when I considered upon these things my heart
            exclaimed well has the wise man said: It is a fool that says in his heart
            there is no God.
        </span>

    <block>
        <span>
            My heart exclaimed all these bear testimony and bespeak an omnipotent
            and omnipresent power, a being who maketh laws and decrees and binds all
            things in their bounds, who fills eternity who was and is and will be from
            all eternity to eternity and when I considered all these things and that
            that being seeks such to worship him as worship him in spirit and in truth
            therefore I cried unto the Lord for mercy for there was none else to whom
            I could go and to obtain mercy.

            the Spirit of God and the Lord opened the heavens upon me and I saw the
            Lord. And he spake unto me
            saying:

                Joseph my son thy sins are forgiven thee. Go thy way walk in my statutes
                and keep my commandments. Behold I am the Lord of glory. I was crucified
                for the world that all those who believe on my name may have eternal life.
                Behold the world lies in sin and at this time and none does good, no not
                one. They have turned aside from the gospel and keep not my commandments.
                They draw near to me with their lips while their hearts are far from me
                and mine anger is kindling against the inhabitants of the earth to visit
                them according to their ungodliness and to bring to pass that which has
                been spoken by the mouth of the prophets and apostles. Behold and lo I
                come quickly, as it is written of me, in the cloud clothed in the glory
                of my Father.

            And my soul was filled with love and for many days I could rejoice with
            great joy and the Lord was with me, but could find none that would believe
            the heavenly vision.
            Nevertheless, I pondered these things in my heart.

            But after many days I fell into transgressions and sinned in many things
            which brought a wound upon my soul. And there were many things which transpired
            that cannot be
            written. And my father’s family have suffered many persecutions and afflictions.
            And it came to pass when I was seventeen years of age I called again upon
            the Lord and he shewed unto me a heavenly vision.

            For behold an angel of the Lord came and stood before me. And it was by
            night and he called me by name and he said the Lord had forgiven me my
            sins. And he revealed unto
            me that in the Town of Manchester, Ontario County, NY there was plates
            of gold upon which there was engravings which was engraven by Moroni &amp;
            his fathers, the servants of the living God in ancient days, and deposited
            by the commandments of God and kept by the power thereof and that I should
            go and get them. And he revealed unto me many things concerning the inhabitants
            of the earth which since have been revealed in commandments &amp; revelations.
            And it was on the 22

        <span>
            And thus he appeared unto me three times in one night and once on the
            next day. And then I immediately went to the place and found where the
            plates was deposited as the angel of the Lord had commanded me and straightway
            made three attempts to get them and then being exceedingly frightened I
            supposed it had been a dream of vision but when I considered I knew that
            it was not therefore I cried unto the Lord in the agony of my soul, “Why
            can I not obtain them?”
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <span>
            Behold the angel appeared unto me again and said unto me, “You have not
            kept the commandments of the Lord which I gave unto you, therefore you
            cannot now obtain them. For the time is not yet fulfilled therefore thou
            wast left unto temptation that thou
            mightest be made acquainted of with the power of the advisory. Therefore
            repent and call on the Lord. Thou shalt be forgiven and in his own due
            time thou shalt obtain them.”

    <block>
        <span>
            For now I had been tempted of the adversary and sought the plates to obtain
            riches and kept not the commandment that I should have an eye single to
            the glory of God.
            Therefore I was chastened and sought diligently to obtain the plates and
            obtained them not until I was twenty-one years of age.

            And in this year I was married to Emma Hale, daughter of Isaac Hale, who

            day of September of this same year I obtained the plates—and in the
            December following we moved to Susquehanna by the assistance of a man
            by the name of Martin Harris, who became convinced of the vision and gave
            me fifty dollars to bear my expenses. And because of his faith and this
            righteous deed the Lord appeared unto him in a vision and shewed unto him
            his marvelous work which he was about to do.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <span>
            And he immediately came to Susquehanna and said the Lord had shown him
            that he must go to New York City with some of the characters so we proceeded
            to copy some of them. And he took his journey to the Eastern Cities and
            to the learned saying, “Read this I pray thee.” And the learned said, “I
            cannot,” but if he would bring the plates they would read it. But the Lord
            had forbid it. And he returned to me and gave them to me to translate.
            And I said, “I cannot for I am not learned. But the Lord had prepared
            spectacles for to
            read the book.” Therefore, I commenced translating the characters and
            thus the prophecy of Isaiah was fulfilled which is written in the 29
        </span><superscript><span>th</span></superscript><span>
            chapter concerning the book.

    <block>
        <span>
            And it came to pass that after we had translated 116 pages that he desired
            to carry them to read to his friends that peradventure he might convince
            them of the truth. Therefore I inquired of the Lord and the Lord said unto
            me that he must not take them. And I spake unto him (Martin) the word of
            the Lord. And he said inquire again. And I inquired again and also the
            third time. And the Lord said unto me, “Let him go with them, only he shall
            covenant with me that he will not shew them to only but four persons.”
            And he
            covenanted with the Lord that he would do according to the word of the
            Lord.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <span>
            Therefore he took them and took his journey unto his friends to Palmyra,
            Wayne County &amp; State of New York. And he brake the covenant which he
            made before the Lord. And the Lord suffered the writings to fall into the
            hands of wicked men. And Martin was
            chastened for his transgression. And I also was chastened also for my
            transgression for asking the Lord the third time, wherefore the Plates
            was taken from me by the power of God and I was not able to obtain them
            for a season. And it came to pass after much
            humility and affliction of soul I obtained them again when Lord appeared
            unto a young man by the name of Oliver Cowdery and shewed unto him the
            plates in a vision and also the truth of the work and what the Lord was
            about to do through me, his unworthy
            servant. Therefore he was desirous to come and write for me and to translate.
            Now my wife had written some for me to translate and also my brother Samuel
            H Smith but we
            had become reduced in property. And my wife’s father was about to turn
            me out of doors and I had not where to go. And I cried unto the Lord that
            he would provide for me to
            accomplish the work whereunto he had commanded me.

            Being wrought up in my mind, respecting the subject of religion and looking
            upon at the different systems taught the children of men, I knew not who
            was right or who was
            wrong. And considering it of the first importance that I should be right,
            in matters that involved eternal consequences; being thus perplexed in
            mind I retired to the silent grove and bowed down before the Lord, under
            a realizing sense that he had said (if the Bible
            be true), ask and you shall receive; knock and it shall be opened; seek
            and you shall find. And again, if any man lack wisdom, let him ask of God
            who gives to all men liberally and
            upbraids not.

            again to pray, but could not. The noise of walking seemed to draw nearer.
            I sprung up on my feet, and looked around, but saw no person or thing that
            was calculated to produce the noise of
            walking. I kneeled again. My mouth was opened and my tongue liberated,
            and I called on the Lord in mighty prayer.

            A pillar of fire appeared above my head, it presently rested down upon
            my head, and filled me with joy unspeakable. A personage appeared in the
            midst of this pillar of flame which was spread all around, and yet nothing
            consumed. Another personage soon appeared like
            unto the first. He said unto me, “Thy sins are forgiven thee.” He testified
            unto me that Jesus Christ is the son of God. And I saw many angels in this
            vision.

            I was about 14 years old when I received this first communication. When
            I was about 17 years old I saw another vision of angels, in the night season
            after I had retired to bed. I had not been asleep, when but was meditating
            upon my past life and experience, I was very conscious that I had not kept
            the commandments, and I repented heartily for all my sins and transgression,
            and humbled myself before Him; whose eyes are over all things.

            All at once the room was illuminated above the brightness of the sun.
            An angel appeared before me, his hands and feet were naked pure and white,
            and he stood between the floors of the room, clothed with in purity inexpressible.
            He said unto me, “I am a messenger sent from God. Be faithful and keep
            his commandments in all things.” He told me of a sacred
            record which was written on plates of gold. I saw in the vision the place
            where they were deposited. He said the Indians were the literal descendants
            of Abraham.

            He explained many things of the prophesies to me. One I will mention which
            is this, in Malachi 4: Behold the day of the Lord comes, etc. Also that
            the Urim and Thumim was hid up with the record, and that God would give
            me power to translate it, with the assistance of this instrument. He then
            gradually vanished out of my sight, or the vision
            closed. While meditating on what I had seen, the angel appeared to me
            again and related the same things and much more. Also the third time bearing
            the same tidings, and
            departed. During the time I was in this vision I did not realize anything
            else around me
            except what was shown me in this communication. After the vision had all
            passed, I found that it was nearly daylight. The family soon arose, I got
            up also.

            On that day while in the field at work with my Father he asked me if I
            was sick. I replied I had but little strength. He told me to go to the
            house. I started and went part way and
            was finally deprived of my strength and fell. But how long I remained
            I do not know. The angel came to me again and commanded me to go and tell
            my father what I had seen and heard. I did so. He wept and told me that
            it was a vision from God to attend to it.

            I went and found the place, where the plates were, according to the direction
            of the angel, also saw them, and the angel as before. The powers of darkness
            strove hard against me. I
            called on God. The angel told me that the reason why I could not obtain
            the plates at this time was because I was under transgression, but to come
            again in one year from that time. I did so, but did not obtain them. Also
            the third and the fourth year, at which time I obtained them, and translated
            them into the English language; by the gift and power of God and have been

            Owing to the many reports which have been put in circulation by evil-disposed
            and designing persons, in relation to the rise and progress of The Church
            of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, all of which have been designed by
            the authors thereof to militate against its character as a Church and its
            progress in the world—I have been induced to write this history, to disabuse
            the public mind, and put all inquirers after truth in
            possession of the facts, as they have transpired, in relation both to
            myself and the Church, so far as I have such facts in my possession.

            In this history I shall present the various
            events in relation to this Church, in truth and righteousness, as they
            have transpired, or as they at present exist, being now [1838] the eighth
            year since the organization of the said Church.

            I was born in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and five,
            on the twenty- third day of December, in the town of Sharon, Windsor county,
            State of Vermont…My father, Joseph Smith, Sen., left the State of Vermont,
            and moved to Palmyra, Ontario (now Wayne) county, in the State of New York,
            when I was in my tenth year, or
            thereabouts. In about four years after my father’s arrival in Palmyra,
            he moved with his family into Manchester in the same county of Ontario—
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>
            his family consisting of eleven souls, namely, my father, Joseph Smith;
            my mother, Lucy Smith (whose name, previous to her marriage, was Mack,
            daughter of Solomon Mack); my brothers, Alvin (who died November 19

            Some time in the second year after our removal to Manchester, there was
            in the place
            where we lived an unusual excitement on the subject of religion. It commenced
            with the Methodists, but soon became general among all the sects in that
            region of country. Indeed, the whole district of country seemed affected
            by it, and great multitudes united
            themselves to the different religious parties, which created no small
            stir and division amongst the people, some crying, “Lo, here!” and others,
            “Lo, there!” Some were contending for the Methodist faith, some for the
            Presbyterian, and some for the Baptist.
        </span><verse>6</verse><span>
            For, notwithstanding the great love which the converts to these different
            faiths expressed at the time of their conversion, and the great zeal manifested
            by the respective clergy, who were active in getting up and promoting this
            extraordinary scene of religious feeling, in
            order to have everybody converted, as they were pleased to call it, let
            them join what sect they pleased; yet when the converts began to file off,
            some to one party and some to another, it was seen that the seemingly good
            feelings of both the priests and the converts were more pretended than
            real; for a scene of great confusion and bad feeling ensued—
            priest contending against priest, and convert against convert; so that
            all their good feelings one for another, if they ever had any, were entirely
            lost in a strife of words and a contest about opinions.

            I was at this time in my fifteenth year. My father’s family was proselyted
            to the
            Presbyterian faith, and four of them joined that church, namely, my mother,
            Lucy; my brothers Hyrum and Samuel Harrison; and my sister Sophronia.
        </span><verse>8</verse><span>
            During this time of great excitement my mind was called up to serious
            reflection and great uneasiness; but though my feelings were deep and often
            poignant, still I kept myself aloof from all these parties, though I attended
            their several meetings as often as occasion would permit.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <span>
            In process of time my mind became somewhat partial to the Methodist sect,
            and I felt some desire to be united with them; but so great were the confusion
            and strife among the
            different denominations, that it was impossible for a person young as
            I was, and so
            unacquainted with men and things, to come to any certain conclusion who
            was right and who was wrong.
        </span><verse>9</verse><span>
            My mind at times was greatly excited, the cry and tumult were so great
            and incessant. The Presbyterians were most decided against the Baptists
            and Methodists, and used all the powers of both reason and sophistry to
            prove their errors, or, at least, to make the people think they were in
            error. On the other hand, the Baptists and Methodists in their turn were
            equally zealous in endeavoring to establish their own tenets and
            disprove all others.

            In the midst of this war of words and tumult of opinions, I often said
            to myself: What is to be done? Who of all these parties are right; or,
            are they all wrong together? If any one of them be right, which is it,
            and how shall I know it?
        </span><verse>11</verse><span>
            While I was laboring under the extreme difficulties caused by the contests
            of these parties of religionists, I was one day
            reading the Epistle of James, first chapter and fifth verse, which reads:

                <referencenote><span>James 1:5</span></referencenote><span>
                    If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men
                    liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.

            Never did any passage of scripture come with more power to the heart of
            man than this did at this time to mine. It seemed to enter with great force
            into every feeling of my heart. I reflected on it again and again, knowing
            that if any person needed wisdom from God, I did; for how to act I did
            not know, and unless I could get more wisdom than I then had, I would never
            know; for the teachers of religion of the different sects understood the
            same passages of scripture so differently as to destroy all confidence
            in settling the question by an appeal to the Bible.

            At length I came to the conclusion that I must either remain in darkness
            and confusion, or else I must do as James directs, that is, ask of God.
            I at length came to the determination to “ask of God,” concluding that
            if he gave wisdom to them that lacked wisdom, and
            would give liberally, and not upbraid, I might venture.
        </span><verse>14</verse><span>
            So, in accordance with this, my determination to ask of God, I retired
            to the woods to make the attempt.

            It was on the morning of a beautiful, clear day, early in the spring of
            eighteen hundred and twenty. It was the first time in my life that I had
            made such an attempt, for amidst all my anxieties I had never as yet made
            the attempt to pray vocally.
        </span><verse>15</verse><span>
            After I had retired to the place where I had previously designed to go,
            having looked around me, and finding myself alone, I kneeled down and began
            to offer up the desires of my heart to God.

    <block>
        <span>
            I had scarcely done so, when immediately I was seized upon by some power
            which entirely overcame me, and had such an astonishing influence over
            me as to bind my
            tongue so that I could not speak. Thick darkness gathered around me, and
            it seemed to me for a time as if I were doomed to sudden destruction.
        </span><verse>16</verse><span>
            But, exerting all my powers to call upon God to deliver me out of the
            power of this enemy which had seized upon me, and at the very moment when
            I was ready to sink into despair and abandon myself to
            destruction—not to an imaginary ruin, but to the power of some actual
            being from the
            unseen world, who had such marvelous power as I had never before felt
            in any being—just at this moment of great alarm, I saw a pillar of light
            exactly over my head, above the
            brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me.
        </span><verse>17</verse><span>
            It no sooner appeared than I found myself delivered from the enemy which
            held me bound.

            When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and
            glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake
            unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other:

            My object in going to inquire of the Lord was to know which of all the
            sects was right, that I might know which to join. No sooner, therefore,
            did I get possession of myself, so as to be able to speak, than I asked
            the Personages who stood above me in the light, which of all the sects
            was right (for at this time it had never entered into my heart that all
            were
            wrong)—and which I should join.

            I was answered that I must join none of them, for they were all wrong;
            and the
            Personage who addressed me said that all their creeds were an abomination
            in his sight; that those professors were all corrupt; that:

                    They draw near to me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me,
                    they teach for doctrines the commandments of men, having a form of godliness,
                    but they deny the power thereof.

            When I came to myself again, I found myself lying on my back, looking
            up into heaven. When the light had departed, I had no strength; but soon
            recovering in some degree, I went home. And as I leaned up to the fireplace,
            mother inquired what the matter was. I replied, “Never mind, all is well—I
            am well enough off.” I then said to my mother, “I have learned for myself
            that Presbyterianism is not true.”

            It seems as though the adversary was aware, at a very early period of

            kingdom; else why should the powers of darkness combine against me? Why
            the opposition and persecution that arose against me, almost in my infancy?

            Some few days after I had this vision, I happened to be in company with
            one of the
            Methodist preachers, who was very active in the before mentioned religious
            excitement; and, conversing with him on the subject of religion, I took
            occasion to give him an
            account of the vision which I had had.
        </span>

            I was greatly surprised at his behavior; he treated my communication not
            only lightly, but with great contempt, saying it was all of the devil,
            that there were no such things as
            visions or revelations in these days; that all such things had ceased
            with the apostles, and that there would never be any more of them.

        <verse>22</verse><span>
            I soon found, however, that my telling the story had excited a great deal
            of prejudice against me among professors of religion, and was the cause
            of great persecution, which continued to increase; and though I was an
            obscure boy, only between fourteen and fifteen years of age, and my circumstances
            in life such as to make a boy of no consequence in the world, yet men of
            high standing would take notice sufficient to excite the public mind against
            me, and create a bitter persecution; and this was common among all the
            sects—all united to persecute me.
        </span><verse>23</verse><span>
            It caused me serious reflection then, and often has since, how
            very strange it was that an obscure boy, of a little over fourteen years
            of age, and one, too, who was doomed to the necessity of obtaining a scanty
            maintenance by his daily labor, should be thought a character of sufficient
            importance to attract the attention of the great ones of the most popular
            sects of the day, and in a manner to create in them a spirit of the most
            bitter persecution and reviling. But strange or not, so it was, and it
            was often the
            cause of great sorrow to myself.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>24</verse><span>
            However, it was nevertheless a fact that I had beheld a vision. I have
            thought since, that I felt much like Paul, when he made his defense before
            King Agrippa, and related the
            account of the vision he had when he saw a light, and heard a voice; but
            still there were
            but few who believed him; some said he was dishonest, others said he was
            mad; and he
            was ridiculed and reviled. But all this did not destroy the reality of
            his vision. He had seen a vision, he knew he had, and all the persecution
            under heaven could not make it
            otherwise; and though they should persecute him unto death, yet he knew,
            and would know to his latest breath, that he had both seen a light and
            heard a voice speaking unto him, and all the world could not make him think
            or believe otherwise.

            So it was with me. I had actually seen a light, and in the midst of that
            light I saw two
            Personages, and they did in reality speak to me; and though I was hated
            and persecuted for saying that I had seen a vision, yet it was true; and
            while they were persecuting me,
            reviling me, and speaking all manner of evil against me falsely for so
            saying, I was led to say in my heart: Why persecute me for telling the
            truth? I have actually seen a vision; and who am I that I can withstand
            God, or why does the world think to make me deny what I have actually seen?
            For I had seen a vision; I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I
            could not deny it, neither dared I do it; at least I knew that by so doing
            I would offend God, and come under condemnation.

            I had now got my mind satisfied so far as the sectarian world was concerned—that
            it was not my duty to join with any of them, but to continue as I was until
            further directed. I had found the testimony of James to be true—that a
            man who lacked wisdom might ask of God, and obtain, and not be upbraided.

            I continued to pursue my common vocations in life until the twenty-first
            of September, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-three, all the time
            suffering severe persecution at the hands of all classes of men, both religious
            and irreligious, because I continued to affirm that I had seen a vision.

            During the space of time which intervened between the time I had the vision
            and the year eighteen hundred and twenty-three—having been forbidden to
            join any of the
            religious sects of the day, and being of very tender years, and persecuted
            by those who ought to have been my friends and to have treated me kindly,
            and if they supposed me to be deluded to have endeavored in a proper and
            affectionate manner to have reclaimed me—I was left to all kinds of temptations;
            and, mingling with all kinds of society, I
            frequently fell into many foolish errors, and displayed the weakness of
            youth, and the foibles of human nature; which, I am sorry to say, led me
            into divers temptations,
            offensive in the sight of God. In making this confession, no one need
            suppose me guilty of any great or malignant sins. A disposition to commit
            such was never in my nature. But I was guilty of levity, and sometimes
            associated with jovial company, etc., not consistent
            with that character which ought to be maintained by one who was called
            of God as I had been. But this will not seem very strange to anyone who
            recollects my youth, and is
            acquainted with my native cheery temperament.

            In consequence of these things, I often felt condemned for my weakness
            and imperfections; when, on the evening of the above-mentioned twenty-first
            of September, after I had retired to my bed for the night, I betook myself
            to prayer and supplication to Almighty God for forgiveness of all my sins
            and follies, and also for a manifestation to me, that I might know of my
            state and standing before him; for I had full confidence in obtaining a
            divine manifestation, as I previously had one.

            While I was thus in the act of calling upon God, I discovered a light
            appearing in my room, which continued to increase until the room was lighter
            than at noonday, when immediately a personage appeared at my bedside, standing
            in the air, for his feet did not touch the floor.
        </span><verse>31</verse><span>
            He had on a loose robe of most exquisite whiteness. It was a whiteness
            beyond anything earthly I had ever seen; nor do I believe that any earthly
            thing could be made to appear so exceedingly white and brilliant. His hands
            were naked, and his arms also, a little above the wrist; so, also, were
            his feet naked, as were his legs, a little above the ankles. His head and
            neck were also bare. I could discover that he had no other clothing on
            but this robe, as it was open, so that I could see into his bosom.
        </span><verse>32</verse><span>
            Not only was his robe
            exceedingly white, but his whole person was glorious beyond description,
            and his
            countenance truly like lightning. The room was exceedingly light, but
            not so very bright as immediately around his person. When I first looked
            upon him, I was afraid; but the fear soon left me.

            He said there was a book deposited, written upon gold plates, giving an
            account of the former inhabitants of this continent, and the source from
            whence they sprang. He also said that the fulness of the everlasting Gospel
            was contained in it, as delivered by the Savior to the ancient inhabitants;
        </span><verse>35</verse><span>
            also, that there were two stones in silver bows—and these stones, fastened
            to a breastplate, constituted what is called the Urim and Thummim—deposited
            with the
            plates; and the possession and use of these stones were what constituted
            “seers” in ancient or former times; and that God had prepared them for
            the purpose of translating the book.

            After telling me these things, he commenced quoting the prophecies of
            the Old
            Testament. He first quoted part of the third chapter of Malachi; and he
            quoted also the fourth or last chapter of the same prophecy, though with
            a little variation from the way it reads in our Bibles. Instead of quoting
            the first verse as it reads in our books, he quoted it thus:

                    yea, and all that do wickedly shall burn as stubble; for they that come
                    shall burn them, saith the Lord of Hosts, that it shall leave them neither
                    root nor branch.

            And again, he quoted the fifth verse thus:

                <referencenote><span>Malachi 4:6</span></referencenote><span>

                    If it were not so, the whole earth would be utterly wasted at his coming.

            In addition to these, he quoted the eleventh chapter of Isaiah, saying
            that it was about to be fulfilled. He quoted also the third chapter of
            Acts, twenty-second and twenty-third
            verses, precisely as they stand in our New Testament. He said that that
            prophet was Christ; but the day had not yet come when “they who would not
            hear his voice should be cut off from among the people,” but soon would
            come.
        </span><verse>41</verse><span>
            He also quoted the second
            chapter of Joel, from the twenty-eighth verse to the last. He also said
            that this was not yet fulfilled, but was soon to be. And he further stated
            that the fulness of the Gentiles was soon to come in. He quoted many other
            passages of scripture, and offered many
            explanations which cannot be mentioned here.

            Again, he told me, that when I got those plates of which he had spoken—for
            the time that they should be obtained was not yet fulfilled—I should not
            show them to any person; neither the breastplate with the Urim and Thummim;
            only to those to whom I should be commanded to show them; if I did I should
            be destroyed. While he was conversing with
            me about the plates, the vision was opened to my mind that I could see
            the place where the plates were deposited, and that so clearly and distinctly
            that I knew the place again when I visited it.

            After this communication, I saw the light in the room begin to gather
            immediately around the person of him who had been speaking to me, and it
            continued to do so until the room was again left dark, except just around
            him; when, instantly I saw, as it were, a conduit open right up into heaven,
            and he ascended till he entirely disappeared, and the room was left as
            it had been before this heavenly light had made its appearance.

            I lay musing on the singularity of the scene, and marveling greatly at
            what had been told to me by this extraordinary messenger; when, in the
            midst of my meditation, I suddenly discovered that my room was again beginning
            to get lighted, and in an instant, as it were, the same heavenly messenger
            was again by my bedside.
        </span><verse>45</verse><span>
            He commenced, and again
            related the very same things which he had done at his first visit, without
            the least
            variation; which having done, he informed me of great judgments which
            were coming upon the earth, with great desolations by famine, sword, and
            pestilence; and that these grievous judgments would come on the earth in
            this generation. Having related these things, he again ascended as he had
            done before.
        </span><verse>46</verse><span>
            By this time, so deep were the
            impressions made on my mind, that sleep had fled from my eyes, and I lay
            overwhelmed in astonishment at what I had both seen and heard.

            But what was my surprise when again I beheld the same messenger at my
            bedside, and heard him rehearse or repeat over again to me the same things
            as before; and added a
            caution to me, telling me that Satan would try to tempt me (in consequence
            of the
            indigent circumstances of my father’s family), to get the plates for the
            purpose of getting rich. This he forbade me, saying that I must have no
            other object in view in getting the plates but to glorify God, and must
            not be influenced by any other motive than that of building his kingdom;
            otherwise I could not get them.
        </span><verse>47</verse><span>
            After this third visit, he again
            ascended into heaven as before, and I was again left to ponder on the
            strangeness of what I had just experienced; when almost immediately after
            the heavenly messenger had
            ascended from me for the third time, the cock crowed, and I found that
            day was approaching, so that our interviews must have occupied the whole
            of that night.

            I shortly after arose from my bed, and, as usual, went to the necessary
            labors of the day; but, in attempting to work as at other times, I found
            my strength so exhausted as to render me entirely unable. My father, who
            was laboring along with me, discovered something to be wrong with me, and
            told me to go home. I started with the intention of going to the house;
            but, in attempting to cross the fence out of the field where we were, my
            strength entirely failed me, and I fell helpless on the ground, and for
            a time was quite unconscious of anything.
        </span><verse>49</verse><span>
            The first thing that I can recollect was a voice speaking unto me, calling
            me by name. I looked up, and beheld the same messenger standing over my
            head, surrounded by light as before. He then again related unto me all
            that he had related to me the previous night, and commanded me to go to
            my father and tell him of the vision and
            commandments which I had received.
        </span><verse>50</verse><span>
            I obeyed; I returned to my father in the field, and rehearsed the whole
            matter to him. He replied to me that it was of God, and told me to go and
            do as commanded by the messenger.

        <span>
            I left the field, and went to the place where the messenger had told me
            the plates were deposited; and owing to the distinctness of the vision
            which I had had concerning it, I
            knew the place the instant that I arrived there.
        </span><verse>51</verse><span>
            Convenient to the village of Manchester, Ontario county, New York, stands
            a hill of considerable size, and the most elevated of any
            in the neighborhood. On the west side of this hill, not far from the top,
            under a stone of considerable size, lay the plates, deposited in a stone
            box. This stone was thick and
            rounding in the middle on the upper side, and thinner towards the edges,
            so that the middle part of it was visible above the ground, but the edge
            all around was covered with
            earth.
        </span><verse>52</verse><span>
            Having removed the earth, I obtained a lever, which I got fixed under
            the edge of the stone, and with a little exertion raised it up.
        </span>

    <block>
        <span>
            I looked in, and there indeed did I behold the plates, the Urim and Thummim,
            and the breastplate, as stated by the messenger. The box in which they
            lay was formed by laying stones together in some kind of cement. In the
            bottom of the box were laid two stones
            crossways of the box, and on these stones lay the plates and the other
            things with them.
        </span><verse>53</verse><span>
            I made an attempt to take them out, but was forbidden by the messenger,
            and was again informed that the time for bringing them forth had not yet
            arrived, neither would it, until four years from that time; but he told
            me that I should come to that place precisely in one year from that time,
            and that he would there meet with me, and that I should continue to do
            so until the time should come for obtaining the plates.

            Accordingly, as I had been commanded, I went at the end of each year,
            and at each time I found the same messenger there, and received instruction
            and intelligence from him at each of our interviews, respecting what the
            Lord was going to do, and how and in what manner his kingdom was to be
            conducted in the last days.

            As my father’s worldly circumstances were very limited, we were under
            the necessity of laboring with our hands, hiring out by day’s work and
            otherwise, as we could get opportunity. Sometimes we were at home, and
            sometimes abroad, and by continuous
            labor were enabled to get a comfortable maintenance.

            In the year 1823 my father’s
            family met with a great affliction by the death of my eldest brother,
            Alvin. In the month of October, 1825, I hired with an old gentleman by
            the name of Josiah Stoal, who lived in Chenango county, State of New York.
            He had heard something of a silver mine having been opened by the Spaniards
            in Harmony, Susquehanna county, State of Pennsylvania; and had, previous
            to my hiring to him, been digging, in order, if possible, to discover the
            mine. After I went to live with him, he took me, with the rest of his hands,
            to dig for the silver mine, at which I continued to work for nearly a month,
            without success in our
            undertaking, and finally I prevailed with the old gentleman to cease digging
            after it. Hence arose the very prevalent story of my having been a money-digger.

            Owing to my continuing to assert that I had seen a vision, persecution
            still followed me, and my wife’s father’s family were very much opposed
            to our being married. I was,
            therefore, under the necessity of taking her elsewhere; so we went and
            were married at the house of Squire Tarbill, in South Bainbridge, Chenango
            county, New York. Immediately after my marriage, I left Mr. Stoal’s, and
            went to my father’s, and farmed with him that season.

            At length the time arrived for obtaining the plates, the Urim and Thummim,
            and the breastplate. On the twenty-second day of September, one thousand
            eight hundred and twenty-seven, having gone as usual at the end of another
            year to the place where they were deposited, the same heavenly messenger
            delivered them up to me with this charge: that I should be responsible
            for them; that if I should let them go carelessly, or through
            any neglect of mine, I should be cut off; but that if I would use all
            my endeavors to
            preserve them, until he, the messenger, should call for them, they should
            be protected.

        <verse>60</verse><span>
            I soon found out the reason why I had received such strict charges to
            keep them safe, and why it was that the messenger had said that when I
            had done what was required at my hand, he would call for them. For no sooner
            was it known that I had them, than the most strenuous exertions were used
            to get them from me. Every stratagem that could be
            invented was resorted to for that purpose. The persecution became more
            bitter and severe than before, and multitudes were on the alert continually
            to get them from me if possible.

            But by the wisdom of God, they remained safe in my hands, until I had
            accomplished by them what was required at my hand. When, according to arrangements,
            the messenger
            called for them, I delivered them up to him; and he has them in his charge
            until this day, being the second day of May, one thousand eight hundred
            and thirty-eight.

            The excitement, however, still continued, and rumor with her thousand
            tongues was all the time employed in circulating falsehoods about my father’s
            family, and about myself. If I were to relate a thousandth part of them,
            it would fill up volumes. The persecution, however, became so intolerable
            that I was under the necessity of leaving Manchester, and going with my
            wife to Susquehanna county, in the State of Pennsylvania. While
            preparing to start—being very poor, and the persecution so heavy upon
            us that there was no probability that we would ever be otherwise—in the
            midst of our afflictions we found a friend in a gentleman by the name of
            Martin Harris, who came to us and gave me fifty dollars to assist us on
            our journey. Mr. Harris was a resident of Palmyra township, Wayne county,
            in the State of New York, and a farmer of respectability.

            By this timely aid was I enabled to reach the place of my destination
            in Pennsylvania; and immediately after my arrival there I commenced copying
            the characters off the plates.
            I copied a considerable number of them, and by means of the Urim and Thummim
            I translated some of them, which I did between the time I arrived at the
            house of my wife’s father, in the month of December, and the February following.
        </span><verse>63</verse><span>
            Sometime in this month of February, the aforementioned Mr. Martin Harris
            came to our place, got the characters which I had drawn off the plates,
            and started with them to the city of New York. For
            what took place relative to him and the characters, I refer to his own
            account of the circumstances, as he related them to me after his return,
            which was as follows:
        </span><quote>
            <block>
                <verse>64</verse><span>
                    I went to the city of New York, and presented the characters which had
                    been translated, with the translation thereof, to Professor Charles Anthon,
                    a gentleman
                    celebrated for his literary attainments. Professor Anthon stated that
                    the translation was correct, more so than any he had before seen translated
                    from the Egyptian. I then showed him those which were not yet translated,
                    and he said that they were Egyptian,
                    Chaldaic, Assyriac, and Arabic; and he said they were true characters.
                    He gave me a
                    certificate, certifying to the people of Palmyra that they were true characters,
                    and that the translation of such of them as had been translated was also
                    correct.
                    I took the certificate and put it into my pocket, and was just leaving
                    the house, when Mr. Anthon called me back, and asked me how the young man
                    found out that there were gold plates in the place where he found them.
                    I answered that an angel of God had revealed it unto him.
                </span><verse>65</verse><span>
                    He then said to me, “Let me see that certificate.”

                    I accordingly took it out of my pocket and gave it to him, when he took
                    it and tore it to pieces, saying that there was no such thing now as ministering
                    of angels, and that if I would bring the plates to him he would translate
                    them. I informed him that part of the plates were sealed, and that I was
                    forbidden to bring them. He replied, “I cannot
                    read a sealed book.” I left him and went to Dr. Mitchell, who sanctioned
                    what Professor Anthon had said respecting both the characters and the translation.

            day of April, 1829, Oliver Cowdery came to my house, until which time
            I had never seen him. He stated to me that having been teaching school
            in the neighborhood where my father resided, and my father being one of those
            who sent to the school, he went to board for a season at his house, and
            while there the family related to him the circumstances of my having received
            the plates, and accordingly he had come to make inquiries of me.

            We still continued the work of translation, when, in the ensuing month
            (May, 1829), we on a certain day went into the woods to pray and inquire
            of the Lord respecting baptism for the remission of sins, that we found
            mentioned in the translation of the plates.

            While we were thus employed, praying and calling upon the Lord, a messenger
            from heaven descended in a cloud of light, and having laid his hands upon
            us, he ordained us, saying:

            <verse>69</verse><span>
                Upon you my fellow servants, in the name of Messiah, I confer the Priesthood
                of Aaron, which holds the keys of the ministering of angels, and of the
                gospel of
                repentance, and of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; and
                this shall never be taken again from the earth until the sons of Levi do
                offer again an offering unto the Lord in righteousness.

            He said this Aaronic Priesthood had not the power of laying on hands for
            the gift of the Holy Ghost, but that this should be conferred on us hereafter;
            and he commanded us to go and be baptized, and gave us directions that
            I should baptize Oliver Cowdery, and that afterwards he should baptize
            me.

            Accordingly we went and were baptized. I baptized him first, and afterwards
            he baptized me—after which I laid my hands upon his head and ordained him
            to the Aaronic
            Priesthood, and afterwards he laid his hands on me and ordained me to
            the same Priesthood—for so we were commanded.

            The messenger who visited us on this occasion and conferred this Priesthood
            upon us, said that his name was John, the same that is called John the
            Baptist in the New
            Testament, and that he acted under the direction of Peter, James and John,
            who held the keys of the Priesthood of Melchizedek, which Priesthood, he
            said, would in due time be conferred on us, and that I should be called
            the first Elder of the Church, and he (Oliver Cowdery) the second. It was
            on the fifteenth day of May, 1829, that we were ordained under the hand
            of this messenger, and baptized.

            Immediately on our coming up out of the water after we had been baptized,
            we experienced great and glorious blessings from our Heavenly Father. No
            sooner had I baptized Oliver Cowdery, than the Holy Ghost fell upon him,
            and he stood up and
            prophesied many things which should shortly come to pass. And again, so
            soon as I had been baptized by him, I also had the spirit of prophecy,
            when, standing up, I prophesied concerning the rise of this Church, and
            many other things connected with the Church, and this generation of the
            children of men. We were filled with the Holy Ghost, and
            rejoiced in the God of our salvation.
        </span><verse>74</verse><span>
            Our minds being now enlightened, we began to have the scriptures laid
            open to our understandings, and the true meaning and intention of
            their more mysterious passages revealed unto us in a manner which we never
            could attain to previously, nor ever before had thought of.

            In the meantime we were forced to keep secret the circumstances of having
            received the Priesthood and our having been baptized, owing to a spirit
            of persecution which had
            already manifested itself in the neighborhood.

            We had been threatened with being mobbed, from time to time, and this,
            too, by professors of religion. And their intentions of mobbing us were
            only counteracted by the influence of my wife’s father’s family (under
            Divine providence), who had become very friendly to me, and who were opposed
            to mobs, and were willing that I should be allowed to continue the work
            of translation
            without interruption; and therefore offered and promised us protection
            from all unlawful proceedings, as far as in them lay.

                    record called the

                    few incidents immediately connected with the rise of this Church, which
                    may be entertaining to some thousands who have stepped forward, amid the

                    given to the Nephites from the mouth of the Savior, of the precise manner
                    in which men should build up His Church, and especially when corruption
                    had spread an uncertainty over all forms and systems practiced among men,
                    without desiring a privilege of showing the willingness of the heart by
                    being buried in the liquid grave, to answer a ‘good conscience by the resurrection

                    After writing the account given of the Savior’s ministry to the remnant
                    of the seed of Jacob, upon this continent, it was easy to be seen, as the
                    prophet said it would be, that darkness covered the earth and gross darkness
                    the minds of the people. On reflecting further it was as easy to be seen
                    that amid the great strife and noise concerning
                    religion, none had authority from God to administer the ordinances of
                    the Gospel. For the question might be asked, have men authority to administer
                    in the name of Christ, who deny revelations, when His testimony is no less
                    than the spirit of prophecy, and His religion based, built, and sustained
                    by immediate revelations, in all ages of the
                    world when He has had a people on earth? If these facts were buried, and
                    carefully concealed by men whose craft would have been in danger if once
                    permitted to shine in the faces of men, they were no longer to us; and
                    we only waited for the commandment to be given ‘Arise and be baptized.’

                    This was not long desired before it was realized. The Lord, who is rich
                    in mercy, and ever willing to answer the consistent prayer of the humble,
                    after we had called upon Him in a fervent manner, aside from the abodes
                    of men, condescended to manifest to us His will. On a sudden, as from the
                    midst of eternity, the voice of the Redeemer spake peace to us, while the
                    veil was parted and the angel of God came down clothed
                    with glory, and delivered the anxiously looked-for message, and the keys
                    of the Gospel of repentance. What joy! what wonder! what amazement! While
                    the world was racked and distracted—while millions were groping as the
                    blind for the wall, and while all men were resting upon uncertainty, as
                    a general mass, our eyes beheld, our ears heard, as in the ‘blaze of day’;
                    yes, more—above the glitter of the May sunbeam, which then shed its brilliancy
                    over the face of nature! Then his voice, though mild, pierced to the center,
                    and his words, ‘I am thy fellow-servant,’ dispelled every fear. We listened,
                    we gazed, we admired! ’Twas the voice of an angel from glory, ’twas a message
                    from the Most High! And as we heard we rejoiced, while His love enkindled
                    upon our souls, and we were wrapped in the vision of the Almighty! Where
                    was room for doubt? Nowhere; uncertainty had fled, doubt had sunk no more
                    to rise, while fiction and deception had fled forever!

                    will believe me when I say, that earth, nor men, with the eloquence of
                    time, cannot begin to clothe language in as interesting and sublime a manner
                    as this holy personage. No; nor has this earth power to give the joy, to
                    bestow the peace, or comprehend the wisdom which was contained in each
                    sentence as they were delivered by the power of the Holy Spirit! Man may
                    deceive his fellow-men, deception may follow deception, and the children
                    of the wicked one may have power to seduce the foolish and untaught, till
                    naught but
                    fiction feeds the many, and the fruit of falsehood carries in its current
                    the giddy to the grave; but one touch with the finger of his love, yes,
                    one ray of glory from the upper world, or one word from the mouth of the
                    Savior, from the bosom of eternity, strikes it all into insignificance,
                    and blots it forever from the mind. The assurance that we
                    were in the presence of an angel, the certainty that we heard the voice
                    of Jesus, and the truth unsullied as it flowed from a pure personage, dictated
                    by the will of God, is to me past description, and I shall ever look upon
                    this expression of the Savior’s goodness with wonder and thanksgiving while
                    I am permitted to tarry; and in those mansions where perfection dwells
                    and sin never comes, I hope to adore in that day
                    which shall never cease.

            , I have written the following sketch of the rise, progress, persecution,
            and faith of the
            Latter-Day Saints, of which I have the honor, under God, of being the
            founder. Mr.
            Wentworth says that he wishes to furnish Mr. George Barstow, a friend
            of his, who is
            writing the history of New Hampshire, with this document. As Mr. Barstow
            has taken the proper steps to obtain correct information all that I shall
            ask at his hands, is, that he
            publish the account entire, ungarnished, and without misrepresentation.

            I was born in the town of Sharon, Windsor Co., Vermont, on the 23
        </span><superscript><span>rd</span></superscript><span>
            of December, A.D. 1805. When ten years old my parents removed to Palmyra,
            New York, where we resided about four years, and from thence we removed
            to the town of Manchester. My father was a farmer and taught me the art
            of husbandry.

            When about fourteen years of age I began to reflect upon the importance
            of being
            prepared for a future state, and upon enquiring the plan of salvation
            I found that there was a great clash in religious sentiment; if I went
            to one society they referred me to one plan, and another to another; each
            one pointing to his own particular creed as the
        </span><italic><span>summum bonum</span></italic><span>
            of perfection: considering that all could not be right, and that God could not be the
            author of so much confusion I determined to investigate the subject more fully, believing that if God had a church it would not be split up into factions, and that if he taught one
            society to worship one way, and administer in one set of ordinances, he would not teach
            another principles which were diametrically opposed. Believing the word of God I had
            confidence in the declaration of James; “If any man lack wisdom let him ask of God who
            gives to all men liberally and upbraids not and it shall be given him,”

            I retired to a secret place in a grove and began to call upon the Lord.
            While fervently engaged in supplication my mind was taken away from the
            objects with which I was surrounded, and I was enwrapped in a heavenly
            vision and saw two glorious personages who exactly resembled each other
            in features, and likeness, surrounded with a brilliant
            light which eclipsed the sun at noon-day. They told me that all religious
            denominations were believing in incorrect doctrines, and that none of them
            was acknowledged of God as his church and kingdom. And I was expressly
            commanded to “go not after them,” at the same time receiving a promise
            that the fulness of the gospel should at some future time be made known
            unto me.

            of September, A.D. 1823, while I was praying unto God, and endeavoring
            to exercise faith in the precious promises of scripture on a sudden a light
            like that of day, only of a far purer and more glorious appearance, and
            brightness burst into the room, indeed the first sight was as though the
            house was filled with consuming fire; the appearance produced a shock that
            affected the whole body; in a moment a personage stood before me surrounded
            with a glory yet greater than that with which I was already
            surrounded.

            This messenger proclaimed himself to be an angel of God sent to bring
            the joyful tidings, that the covenant which God made with ancient Israel
            was at hand to be fulfilled, that the preparatory work for the second coming
            of the Messiah was speedily to commence; that the time was at hand for
            the gospel in all its fulness to be preached in power unto all nations,
            that a people might be prepared for the millennial reign.

            I was also informed concerning the aboriginal inhabitants of this country,
            and shown who they were, and from whence they came; a brief sketch of their
            origin, progress,
            civilization, laws, governments, of their righteousness and iniquity,
            and the blessings of God being finally withdrawn from them as a people
            was made known unto me. I was also told where there was deposited some
            plates on which were engraven an abridgement of the records of the ancient
            prophets that had existed on this continent. The angel appeared to me three
            times the same night and unfolded the same things.

            After having received many visits from the angels of God unfolding the
            majesty, and glory of the events that should transpire in the last days,
            on the morning of the 22
        </span><superscript><span>nd</span></superscript><span>
            of September A.D. 1827, the angel of the Lord delivered the records into

            These records were engraven on plates which had the appearance of gold,
            each plate was six inches wide and eight inches long and not quite so thick
            as common tin. They were
            filled with engravings, in Egyptian characters and bound together in a
            volume, as the
            leaves of a book with three rings running through the whole. The volume
            was something near six inches in thickness, a part of which was sealed.
            The characters on the unsealed part were small, and beautifully engraved.
            The whole book exhibited many marks of antiquity in its construction and
            much skill in the art of engraving. With the records was found a curious
            instrument which the ancients called “Urim and Thummim,” which consisted
            of two transparent stones set in the rim of a bow fastened to a breast
            plate.
            Through the medium of the Urim and Thummim I translated the record by
            the gift, and power of God.

            In this important and interesting book the history of ancient America
            is unfolded, from its first settlement by a colony that came from the tower
            of Babel, at the confusion of
            languages to the beginning of the fifth century of the Christian era.
            We are informed by these records that America in ancient times has been
            inhabited by two distinct races of people. The first were called Jaredites
            and came directly from the tower of Babel. The second race came directly
            from the city of Jerusalem, about six hundred years before Christ. They
            were principally Israelites, of the descendants of Joseph. The Jaredites
            were
            destroyed about the time that the Israelites came from Jerusalem, who
            succeeded them in the inheritance of the country. The principal nation
            of the second race fell in battle
            towards the close of the fourth century. The remnant are the Indians that
            now inhabit this country.

            This book also tells us that our Savior made his appearance upon this
            continent after his
            resurrection, that he planted the gospel here in all its fulness, and
            richness, and power, and blessing; that they had apostles, prophets, pastors,
            teachers and evangelists; the same order, the same priesthood, the same
            ordinances, gifts, powers, and blessing, as was enjoyed on the eastern
            continent, that the people were cut off in consequence of their transgressions,
            that the last of their prophets who existed among them was commanded to
            write an
            abridgement of their prophesies, history, etc., and to hide it up in the
            earth, and that it should come forth and be united with the Bible
            for the accomplishment of the purposes of God in the last days. For a
            more particular account I would refer to the
            Book of Mormon,
            which can be purchased at Nauvoo, or from any of our travelling elders.

            As soon as the news of this discovery was made known, false reports, misrepresentation
            and slander flew as on the wings of the wind in every direction, the house
            was frequently beset by mobs, and evil designing persons, several times
            I was shot at, and very narrowly escaped, and every device was made use
            of to get the plates away from me, but the power and blessing of God attended
            me, and several began to believe my testimony.

            On the 6
        </span><superscript><span>th</span></superscript><span>
            of April, 1830, the “Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints,” was
            first organized in the town of Manchester, Ontario co., state of New York.8
            Some few were called and ordained by the spirit of revelation, and prophesy,
            and began to preach as the
            spirit gave them utterance, and though weak, yet were they strengthened
            by the power of God, and many were brought to repentance, were immersed
            in the water, and were filled with the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands.
            They saw visions and prophesied, devils were cast out and the sick healed
            by the laying on of hands. From that time the work
            rolled forth with astonishing rapidity, and churches were soon formed
            in the states of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and Missouri;
            in the last named state a considerable settlement was formed in Jackson
            co.; numbers joined the church and we
            were increasing rapidly; we made large purchases of land, our farms teemed
            with plenty, and peace and happiness was enjoyed in our domestic circle
            and throughout our neighborhood; but as we could not associate with our
            neighbors who were many of them
            of the basest of men and had fled from the face of civilized society,
            to the frontier country to escape the hand of justice, in their midnight
            revels, their sabbath breaking, horseracing, and gambling, they commenced
            at first ridicule, then to persecute, and finally an
            organized mob assembled and burned our houses, tarred, and feathered,
            and whipped many of our brethren and finally drove them from their habitations;
            who houseless, and homeless, contrary to law, justice and humanity, had
            to wander on the bleak prairies till the children left the tracks of their
            blood on the prairie, this took place in the month of November, and they
            had no other covering but the canopy of heaven, in this inclement season
            of the year; this proceeding was winked at by the government and although
            we had warrantee deeds for our land, and had violated no law we could obtain
            no redress.
        </span>

        <span>
            There were many sick, who were thus inhumanly driven from their houses,
            and had to endure all this abuse and to seek homes where they could be
            found. The result was, that a great many of them being deprived of the
            comforts of life, and the necessary attendances, died; many children were
            left orphans; wives, widows; and husbands widowers. Our farms were taken
            possession of by the mob, many thousands of cattle, sheep, horses, and
            hogs,
            were taken and our household goods, store goods, and printing press, and
            type were broken, taken, or otherwise destroyed.

            Many of our brethren removed to Clay where they continued until 1836,
            three years; there was no violence offered but there were threatenings
            of violence. But in the summer of 1836, these threatenings began to assume
            a more serious form; from threats, public
            meetings were called, resolutions were passed, vengeance and destruction
            were threatened, and affairs again assumed a fearful attitude, Jackson
            County was a sufficient precedent, and as the authorities in that county
            did not interfere, they boasted that they would not in this, which on application
            to the authorities we found to be too true, and after much
            violence, privation and loss of property we were again driven from our
            homes.

            We next settled in Caldwell, and Daviess Counties, where we made large
            and extensive settlements, thinking to free ourselves from the power of
            oppression, by settling in new counties, with very few inhabitants in them;
            but here we were not allowed to live in peace, but in 1838 we were again
            attacked by mobs an exterminating order was issued by Gov. Lilburn W. Boggs,
            and under the sanction of law an organized banditti ranged
            through the country, robbed us of our cattle, sheep, horses, hogs, etc.,
            many of our people were murdered in cold blood, the chastity of our women
            was violated, and we were
            forced to sign away our property at the point of the sword, and after
            enduring every
            indignity that could be heaped upon us by an inhuman, ungodly band of
            marauders, from twelve to fifteen thousand souls men, women, and children
            were driven from their own
            fire sides, and from lands that they had warrantee deeds of, houseless,
            friendless, and
            homeless (in the depth of winter,) to wander as exiles on the earth or
            to seek an asylum in a more genial clime, and among a less barbarous people.

            Many sickened and died, in consequence of the cold, and hardships they
            had to endure; many wives were left widows, and children orphans, and destitute.
            It would take more time than is allotted me here to describe the injustice,
            the wrongs, the murders, the bloodshed, the theft, misery and woe that
            has been caused by the barbarous, inhuman, and lawless, proceedings of
            the state of Missouri.

            In the situation before alluded to we arrived in the state of Illinois
            in 1839, where we
            found a hospitable people and a friendly home; a people who were willing
            to be governed by the principles of law and humanity. We have commenced
            to build a city called
            “Nauvoo” in Hancock co., we number from six to eight thousand here besides
            vast numbers in the county around and in almost every county of the state.
            We have a city
            charter granted us and a charter for a legion the troops of which now
            number 1500. We have also a charter for a university, for an agricultural
            and manufacturing society, have our own laws and administrators, and possess
            all the privileges that other free and
            enlightened citizens enjoy.

            Persecution has not stopped the progress of truth, but has only added
            fuel to the flame, it has spread with increasing rapidity, proud of the
            cause which they have espoused and conscious of their innocence and of
            the truth of their system amidst calumny and reproach have the elders of
            this church gone forth, and planted the gospel in almost every state in
            the Union; it has penetrated our cities, it has spread over our villages,
            and has caused thousands of our intelligent, noble, and patriotic citizens
            to obey its divine mandates, and be governed by its sacred truths. It has
            also spread into England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales: in the year of 1839
            where a few of our missionaries were sent over five thousand joined the
            standard of truth, there are numbers now joining in every land.

            Palestine, New Holland, the East Indies, and other places, the standard
            of truth has been erected: no
            unhallowed hand can stop the work from progressing, persecutions may rage,
            mobs may combine, armies may assemble, calumny may defame, but the truth
            of God will go forth boldly, nobly, and independent till it has penetrated
            every continent, visited every clime, swept every country, and sounded
            in every ear, till the purposes of God shall be
            accomplished and the great Jehovah shall say the work is done.

            We believe that a man must be called of God by “prophesy, and by laying

                In 1835, Oliver Cowdery wrote a series of letters which were published

                newspaper. Several of these letters provided a detailed account of Joseph’s

                the plates. This section contains key extracts from those letters.

            On the evening of the 21
        </span><superscript><span>st</span></superscript><span>
            of September, 1823, previous to retiring to rest, our brother’s mind was
            unusually wrought up on the subject which had so long agitated his mind—his
            heart was drawn out in fervent prayer, and his whole soul was so lost to
            everything of a temporal nature, that earth, to him, had lost its charms,
            and all he desired was to be
            prepared in heart to commune with some kind messenger who could communicate
            to him the desired information of his acceptance with God.

            At length the family retired, and he, as usual, bent his way, though in
            silence, where others might have rested their weary frames “locked fast
            in sleep’s embrace;” but repose had fled, and accustomed slumber had spread
            her refreshing hand over others beside him— he continued still to pray—his
            heart, though once hard and obdurate, was softened, and that mind which
            had often flitted, like the “wild bird of passage,” had settled upon a
            determined basis not to be decoyed or driven from its purpose.

            In this situation hours passed unnumbered—how many or how few I know not,
            neither is he able to inform me; but supposes it must have been eleven
            or twelve, and perhaps later, as the noise and bustle of the family, in
            retiring, had long since ceased. While continuing in prayer for a manifestation
            in some way that his sins were forgiven; endeavoring to
            exercise faith in the scriptures, on a sudden a light like that of day,
            only of a purer and far more glorious appearance and brightness, burst
            into the room. Indeed to use his own
            description, the first sight was as though the house was filled with consuming
            and unquenchable fire. This sudden appearance of a light so bright, as
            must naturally be
            expected, occasioned a shock or sensation, visible to the extremities
            of the body. It was, however, followed with a calmness and serenity of
            mind, and an overwhelming rapture of Joy that surpassed understanding,
            and in a moment a personage stood before him.

        <span>
            Notwithstanding the room was previously filled with light above the brightness
            of the sun, as I before described, yet there seemed to be an additional
            glory surrounding or accompanying this personage, which shone with an increased
            degree of brilliancy, of
            which he was in the midst; and though his countenance was as lightning,
            yet it was of a
            pleasing, innocent and glorious appearance, so much so, that every fear
            was banished from the heart, and nothing but calmness pervaded the soul.

            It is no easy task to describe the appearance of a messenger from the
            skies—indeed, I doubt their being an individual clothed with perishable
            clay, who is capable to do this work. To be sure, the Lord appeared to
            his apostles after his resurrection, and we do not learn as they were in
            the least difficultied to look upon him; but from John’s description upon
            Patmos, we learn that he is there represented as most glorious in appearance;
            and from other items in the sacred scriptures we have the fact recorded
            where angels appeared and conversed with men, and there was no difficulty
            on the part of the individuals, to endure their presence; and others where
            their glory was so conspicuous that they could not
            endure. The last description or appearance is the one to which I refer,
            when I say that it is no easy task to describe their glory.

            But it may be well to relate the particulars as far as given. The stature
            of this personage was a little above the common size of men in this age;
            his garment was perfectly white, and had the appearance of being without
            seam.

            Though fear was banished from his heart, yet his surprise was no less
            when he heard him declare himself to be a messenger sent by commandment
            of the Lord, to deliver a special message and to witness to him that his
            sins were forgiven, and that his prayers were heard; and that the scriptures
            might be fulfilled, which say:

                    This cannot be brought about until first certain preparatory things are
                    accomplished, for so has the Lord purposed in his own mind. He has therefore
                    chosen you as an instrument in his hand to bring to light that which shall
                    perform his act, his strange
                    act, and bring to pass a marvelous work and a wonder. Wherever the sound
                    shall go it shall cause the ears of men to tingle, and wherever it shall
                    be proclaimed, the pure in heart shall rejoice, while those who draw near
                    to God with their mouths, and honor him with their lips, while their hearts
                    are far from him, will seek its overthrow, and the destruction of those
                    by whose hands it is carried. Therefore, marvel not if your name is made
                    a derision, and had as a by-word among such, if you are the instrument
                    in bringing it, by the gift of God, to the knowledge of the people.

            He then proceeded and gave a general account of the promises made to the
            fathers, and also gave a history of the aborigines of this country, and
            said they were literal descendants of Abraham. He represented them as once
            being an enlightened and intelligent people, possessing a correct knowledge
            of the gospel, and the plan of restoration and redemption. He said this
            history was written and deposited not far from that place, and that it
            was our brother’s privilege, if obedient to the commandments of the Lord,
            to obtain and translate the same by the means of the Urim and Thummim,
            which were deposited for that
            purpose with the record.

            “Yet,” said he, “the scriptures must be fulfilled before it is translated,

            to the learned; for thus has God
            determined to leave men without excuse, and show to the meek that his

            A part of the book was sealed, and was not to be opened yet. The sealed
            part, said he, contains the same revelation which was given to John upon
            the isles of Patmos, and when the people of the Lord are prepared, and
            found worthy, then it will be unfolded unto them.

            On the subject of bringing to light the unsealed part of this record,
            it may be proper to say that our brother was expressly informed that it
            must be done with an eye single to the glory of God; if this consideration
            did not wholly characterize all his proceedings in
            relation to it, the adversary of truth would overcome him, or at least
            prevent his making that proficiency in this glorious work which he otherwise
            would.

            While describing the place where the record was deposited, he gave a minute
            relation of it, and the vision of his mind being opened at the same time,
            he was permitted to view it critically; and previously being acquainted
            with the place, he was able to follow the
            direction of the vision, afterward, according to the voice of the angel,
            and obtain the book.

            I gave, in my last, a few words, on the subject of a few items, as spoken
            by the angel at the time the knowledge of the record of the Nephites was
            communicated to our brother, and in consequence of the subject of the gospel
            and that of the gathering of Israel’s being so connected, I found it difficult
            to speak of the one without mentioning the other; and this may not be improper,
            as it is evident, that the Lord has decreed to bring forth the fulness
            of the gospel in the last days, previous to gathering Jacob, but a preparatory
            work, and the other is to follow in quick succession.

                    of the enemy; and gathered out of the lands from the east, and from the
                    west from the north and
                    from the south. They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they
                    found no city to dwell in. Hungry and thirsty, their souls fainted in them.
                    Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them out
                    of their distresses; and led them in the right way that they might go to
                    the city of habitations.

            Most clearly was it shown to the prophets, that the righteous should be
            gathered from all the earth: He knew that the children of Israel were led
            from Egypt, by the right hand of the Lord, and permitted to possess the
            land of Canaan, though they were rebellious in the desert but he farther
            knew, that they were not gathered from the east, the west, the north and
            the south, at that time; for it was clearly manifested that the Lord himself
            would
            prepare a habitation, even as he said, when he would lead them to a city
            of refuge.

            In that, David saw a promise for the righteous, when they should
            be delivered from those who oppressed them, and from the hand of strange
            children, or the enemies of the Lord; that their sons should be like plants
            grown up in their youth, and their daughters like corner- stones, polished
            after the similitude of a beautiful palace.

            It is then that the sons and
            daughters shall prophesy, old men dream dreams, and young men see visions.
            At that time the garners of the righteous will be full, affording all manner
            of store. It was while contemplating this time, and viewing this happy
            state of the righteous, that he further says, “The Lord shall reign forever,
            even thy God, O Zion, unto all generations—Praise ye the Lord!”

            I have now given you a rehearsal of what was communicated to our brother,
            when he was directed to go and obtain the record of the Nephites. I may
            have missed in arrangement in some instances, but the principle is preserved,
            and you will be able to bring forward
            abundance of corroborating scripture upon the subject of the gospel and
            of the gathering.

            You are aware of the fact, that to give a minute rehearsal of a lengthy
            interview with a heavenly messenger, is very difficult unless one is assisted
            immediately with the gift of inspiration. There is another item I wish
            to notice on the subject of visions. The Spirit, you know, searches all
            things, even the deep things of God. When God manifests to his
            servants those things that are to come, or those which have been, he does
            it by unfolding them by the power of that Spirit which comprehends all
            things, always; and so much may
            be shown and made perfectly plain to the understanding in a short time,
            that to the world, who are occupied all their life to learn a little, look
            at the relation of it, and are disposed to call it false. You will understand
            then by this, that while those glorious things were being rehearsed, the
            vision was also opened so that our brother was permitted to see and
            understand much more fully and perfectly than I am able to communicate
            in writing. I know much may be conveyed to the understanding in writing,
            and many marvelous
            truths set forth with the pen, but after all it is but a shadow, compared
            to an open vision of seeing, hearing and realizing eternal things. And
            if the fact was known, it would be found, that of all the heavenly communications
            to the ancients, we have no more in comparison than the alphabet to a quarto
            vocabulary.

            It is said, and I believe the account, that the Lord showed the brother
            of Jared
            (Moriancumer) all things which were to transpire from that day to the
            end of the earth, as well as those which had taken place. I believe that
            Moses was permitted to see the same, as the Lord caused them to pass, in
            vision before him as he stood upon the mount. I believe that the Lord Jesus
            told many things to his apostles which are not written, and after his
            ascension unfolded all things unto them. I believe that Nephi, the son
            of Lehi, whom the Lord brought out of Jerusalem, saw the same. I believe
            that the twelve upon this continent, whom the Lord chose to preach his
            gospel, when he came down to manifest to this branch of the house of Israel,
            that he had other sheep who should hear his voice, were also permitted
            to behold the same mighty things transpire in vision before their eyes.
            And I believe that the angel Moroni, whose words I have been rehearsing,
            who communicated the knowledge of the record of the Nephites in this age,
            saw also, before he hid up the same unto the Lord, great and marvelous
            things which were to transpire when the same should come forth; and I also
            believe, that God will give line upon line precept upon
            precept to his saints, until all these things will be unfolded to them,
            and they finally sanctified and brought into the Celestial glory, where
            tears will be wiped from all faces, and sighing and sorrowing flee away!

            of September, 1823, and gave an outline of the conversation of the angel
            upon the important fact of the blessings, promises and covenants to Israel,
            and the great
            manifestations of favor to the world, in the ushering in of the fulness
            of the gospel, to
            prepare the way for the second advent of the Messiah, when he comes in
            the glory of the Father with the holy angels.

            A remarkable fact is to be noticed with regard to this vision. In ancient
            times the Lord warned some of his servants in dreams: for instance, Joseph,
            the husband of Mary, was warned in a dream to take the young child and
            his mother, and flee into Egypt: also, the
            wise men were warned of the Lord in a dream not to return to Herod; and
            when “out of Egypt the Son was called” the angel of the Lord appeared in
            a dream to Joseph again: also he was warned in a dream to turn aside into
            the parts of Galilee. Such were the
            manifestations to Joseph, the favored descendant of the father of the
            faithful in dreams, and in them the Lord fulfilled his purposes: But the
            one of which I have been speaking is what would have been called an open
            vision. And though it was in the night, yet it was not a dream. There is
            no room for conjecture in this matter, and to talk of deception would be
            to sport with the common sense of every man who knows when he is awake,
            when he sees and when he does not see.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <span>
            He could not have been deceived in the fact that a being of some kind
            appeared to him; and that it was an heavenly one, the fulfillment of his
            words, so minutely, up to this time, in addition to the truth and word
            of salvation which has been developed to this
            generation, in the Book of Mormon,
            ought to be conclusive evidence to the mind of every man who is privileged
            to hear of the same. He was awake, and in solemn prayer, as you will bear
            in mind, when the angel made his appearance; from that glory which
            surrounded him the room was lit up to a perfect brilliancy, so that darkness
            wholly disappeared: he heard his words with his ears, and received a joy
            and happiness
            indescribable by hearing that his own sins were forgiven, and his former
            transgressions to be remembered against him no more, if he then continued
            to walk before the Lord
            according to his holy commandments. He also saw him depart, the light
            and glory
            withdraw, leaving a calmness and peace of soul past the language of man
            to paint—was he deceived?

            Far from this; for the vision was renewed twice before morning, unfolding
            farther and still farther the mysteries of godliness and those things to
            come. In the morning he went. to his labor as usual, but soon the vision
            of the heavenly messenger was renewed, instructing him to go immediately
            and view those things of which he had been informed, with a promise that
            he should obtain them if he followed the directions and went with an eye
            single to the glory of God.

            Accordingly he repaired to the place which had thus been described. But
            it is necessary to give you more fully the express instructions of the
            angel, with regard to the object of this work in which our brother had
            now engaged. He was to remember that it was the work of the Lord, to fulfil
            certain promises previously made to a branch of the house of Israel, of
            the tribe of Joseph, and when it should be brought forth must be done expressly
            with an eye, as I said before, single to the glory of God, and the welfare
            and restoration of the house of Israel.

    <block>
        <span>
            You will understand, then, that no motive of a pecuniary, or earthly nature,
            was to be
            suffered to take the lead of the heart of the man thus favored. The allurements
            of vice, the contaminating influence of wealth, without the direct guidance
            of the Holy Spirit, must have no place in the heart nor be suffered to
            take from it that warm desire for the glory and kingdom of the Lord, or
            instead of obtaining, disappointment and reproof would most assuredly follow.
            Such was the instruction and this the caution.

            Alternately, as we could naturally expect, the thought of the previous
            vision was
            ruminating in his mind, with a reflection of the brightness and glory
            of the heavenly messenger; but again a thought would start across the mind
            on the prospects of obtaining so desirable a treasure—one in all human
            probability sufficient to raise him above a level with the common earthly
            fortunes of his fellow men, and relieve his family from want, in which,
            by misfortune and sickness they were placed.
        </span>

    <block>
        <span>
            It is very natural to suppose that the mind would revolve upon those scenes
            which had passed, when those who had acquired a little of this world’s
            goods, by industry and economy, with the blessings of health or friends,
            or by art and intrigue from the pockets of the day-laborer, or the widow
            and the fatherless, had passed by with a stiff neck and a cold heart, scorning
            the virtuous because they were poor, and lording over those who were subjected
            to suffer the miseries of this life.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <span>
            Alternately did these, with a swift reflection of the words of the holy
            messenger,—
            “Remember, that he who does this work, who is thus favored of the Lord,
            must do it with his eye single to the glory of the same, and the welfare
            and restoration of the scattered
            remnants of the house of Israel”—rush upon his mind with the quickness
            of electricity.

            Here was a struggle indeed; for when he calmly reflected upon his errand,
            he knew that if God did not give, he could not obtain; and again, with
            the thought or hope of obtaining, his mind would be carried back to its
            former reflections of poverty, abuse,— wealth,
            grandeur and ease, until before arriving at the place described, this
            wholly occupied his desires; and when he thought upon the fact of what
            was previously shown him, it was only with an assurance that he should
            obtain, and accomplish his desires in relieving himself and friends from
            want.

            A history of the inhabitants who peopled this continent, previous to its
            being discovered to Europeans by Columbus, must be interesting to every
            man; and as it would develop the important fact, that the present race
            were descendants of Abraham, and were to be
            remembered in the immutable covenant of the Most High to that man, and
            be restored to a knowledge of the gospel, that they, with all nations might
            rejoice, seemed to inspire
            further thoughts of gain and income from such a valuable history. Surely,
            thought he
            every man will seize with eagerness, this knowledge, and this incalculable
            income will be mine. Enough to raise the expectations of any one of like
            inexperience, placed in similar
            circumstances. But the important point in this matter is, that man does
            not see as the Lord, neither are his purposes like his. The small things
            of this life are but dust in comparison
            with salvation and eternal life.

            It is sufficient to say that such were his reflections during his walk
            of from two to three miles: the distance from his father’s house to the
            place pointed out. And to use his own words it seemed as though two invisible
            powers were influencing or striving to influence his mind—one with the
            reflection that if he obtained the object of his pursuit, it would be through
            the mercy and condescension of the Lord, and that every act or performance
            in relation to it, must be in strict accordance with the instruction of that
            personage, who communicated the intelligence to him first; and the other
            with the thoughts and
            reflections like those previously mentioned—contrasting his former and
            present
            circumstances in life with those to come. That precious instruction recorded
            on the sacred page—pray always—which was expressly impressed upon him,
            was at length entirely forgotten, and as I previously remarked, a fixed
            determination to obtain and aggrandize himself, occupied his mind when
            he arrived at the place where the record was found.

            You are acquainted with the mail road from Palmyra, Wayne Co. to Canandaigua,
            Ontario Co. N.Y. and also, as you pass from the former to the latter place,
            before arriving at the little village of Manchester, say from three to
            four, or about four miles from
            Palmyra, you pass a large hill on the east side of the road. Why I say
            large, is because it is as large perhaps, as any in that country. To a
            person acquainted with this road, a
            description would be unnecessary, as it is the largest and rises the highest
            of any on that route. The north end rises quite sudden until it assumes
            a level with the more southerly extremity, and I think I may say an elevation
            higher than at the south a short distance, say half or three fourths of
            a mile. As you pass toward Canandaigua it lessens gradually until the surface
            assumes its common level, or is broken by other smaller hills or ridges,
            water courses and ravines. I think I am justified in saying that this is
            the highest hill for some
            distance round, and I am certain that its appearance, as it rises so suddenly
            from a plain on the north, must attract the notice of the travelers as
            he passes by.

            At about one mile west rises another ridge of less height, running parallel
            with the former, leaving a beautiful vale between. The soil is of the first
            quality for the country, and under a state of cultivation, which gives
            a prospect at once imposing, when one reflects on the
            fact, that here, between these hills, the entire power and national strength
            of both the Jaredites and Nephites were destroyed.

            you will read Mormon’s account of the last great struggle of his people,
            as they were encamped round this hill Cumorah. (it is printed Camorah,
            which is an error.) In this valley fell the
            remaining strength and pride of a once powerful people, the Nephites—once
            so highly
            favored of the Lord, but at that time in darkness, doomed to suffer extermination
            by the hand of their barbarous and uncivilized brethren. From the top of
            this hill, Mormon, with a few others, after the battle, gazed with horror
            upon the mangled remains of those who, the day before, were filled with
            anxiety, hope or doubt. A few had fled to the south, who were hunted down
            by the victorious party, and all who would not deny the Savior and his
            religion, were put to death. Mormon himself, according to the record of
            his son Moroni, was also slain.

            But a long time previous to this disaster it appears from his own account,
            he foresaw approaching destruction. In fact, if he perused the records
            of his fathers, [p. 86] which
            were in his possession, he could have learned that such would be the case.
            Alma, who lived before the coming of the Messiah, prophesies this. He,
            however, by divine appointment, abridged from those records, in his own
            style and language, a short account of the more important and prominent
            items, from the days of Lehi to his own time, after which he

            It was not the wicked who overcame the righteous; far from this: it was
            the wicked against the wicked, and by the wicked the wicked were punished.
            The Nephites who
            were once enlightened, had fallen from a more elevated standing as to
            favor and privilege before the Lord in consequence of the righteousness
            of their fathers, and now falling below, for such was actually the case,
            were suffered to be overcome, and the land was left to the possession of
            the red men, who were without intelligence, only in the affairs of their
            wars; and having no records, only preserving their history by tradition
            from father to son, lost the account of their true origin, and wandered
            from river to river, from hill to hill,
            from mountain to mountain, and from sea to sea, till the land was again
            peopled, in a measure, by a rude, wild, revengeful, warlike and barbarous
            race. Such are our Indians.

            This hill, by the Jaredites, was called Ramah: by it, or around it pitched
            the famous army of Coriantumr their tents. Coriantumr was the last king
            of the Jaredites The opposing
            army were to the west, and in this same valley, and nearby, from day to
            day, did that mighty race spill their blood, in wrath, contending, as it
            were, brother against brother, and father, against son. In this same spot,
            in full view from the top of this same hill, one may gaze with astonishment
            upon the ground which was twice covered with the dead and
            dying of our fellow men. Here may be seen where once sunk to naught the
            pride and
            strength of two mighty nations; and here may be contemplated, in solitude,
            while nothing but the faithful record of Mormon and Moroni is now extant
            to inform us of the fact,
            scenes of misery and distress—the aged, whose silver locks in other places
            and at other times would command reverence; the mother, who in other circumstances
            would be spared from violence; the infant, whose tender cries would be
            regarded and listened to with a feeling of compassion and tenderness; and
            the virgin, whose grace, beauty and modesty, would be esteemed and held
            inviolate by all good men and enlightened and
            civilized nations, alike disregarded and treated with scorn!—in vain did
            the hoary head and man of gray hairs ask for mercy; in vain did the mother
            plead for compassion; in vain did the helpless and harmless infant weep
            for verry anguish, and in vain did the virgin seek to
            escape the ruthless hand of revengeful foes and demons in human form—all
            alike were trampled down by the feet of the strong, and crushed beneath
            the rage of battle and war!
            Alas, who can reflect upon the last struggles of great and populous nations,
            sinking to dust beneath the hand of Justice and retribution without weeping
            over the corruptions of the human heart, and sighing for the hour when
            the clangor of arms shall no more be heard, nor the calamities of contending
            armies no more experienced for a thousand years? Alas, the calamity of
            war, the extinction of nations, the ruin of kingdoms, the fall of empires
            and the dissolution of governments! O the misery, distress and evil attendant
            on these!
            Who can contemplate like scenes without sorrowing, and who so destitute
            of
            commiseration as not to be pained that man has fallen so low, so far beneath
            the station in which he was created?

            In this vale lie commingled, in one mass of ruin the ashes of thousands,
            and in this vale was destined to consume the fair forms and vigorous systems
            of tens of thousands of the human race—blood mixed with blood, flesh with
            flesh, bones with bones and dust with dust! When the vital spark which
            animated their clay had fled, each lifeless lump lay on one common level—cold
            and inanimate. Those bosoms which had burned with rage
            against each other for real or supposed injury, had now ceased to heave
            with malice; those arms which were, a few moments before nerved with strength,
            had alike become
            paralyzed and those hearts which had been fired with revenge, had now
            ceased to beat, and the head to think—in silence, in solitude, and in disgrace
            alike, they have long since turned to earth, to their mother dust, to await
            the august, and to millions, awful hour, when the trump of the Son of God
            shall echo and reecho from the skies, and they come
            forth, quickened and immortalized, to not only stand in each other’s presence,
            but before the bar of him who is Eternal!

            The hill of which I have been speaking, at the time mentioned, presented
            a varied appearance: the north end rose suddenly from the plain, forming
            a promontory without timber, but covered with grass. As you passed to the
            south you soon came to scattering
            timber, the surface having been cleared by art or by wind; and a short
            distance further left, you are surrounded with the common forest of the
            country. It is necessary to observe, that even the part cleared was only
            occupied for pasturage, its steep ascent and narrow summit not admitting
            the plow of the husbandman, with any degree of ease or profit. It was at
            the second mentioned place where the record was found to be deposited,
            on the west side of the hill, not far from the top down its side; and when
            myself visited the place in the year 1830, there were several trees standing:
            enough to cause a shade in summer, but not so
            much as to prevent the surface being covered with grass—which was also
            the case when the record was first found.

            Whatever may be the feeling of men on the reflection of past acts which
            have been performed on certain portions or spots of this earth, I know
            not, neither does it add or
            diminish to nor from the reality of my subject. When Moses heard the voice
            of God, at the foot of Horeb, out of the burning bush, he was commanded
            to take his shoes off his
            feet, for the ground on which he stood was holy. The same may be observed
            when Joshua beheld the “Captain of the Lord’s host” by Jericho. And I confess
            that my mind was filled with many reflections; and though I did not then
            loose my shoe, yet with gratitude to God did I offer up the sacrifice of
            my heart.

            How far below the surface these records were placed by Moroni, I am unable
            to say; but from the fact they had been some fourteen hundred years buried,
            and that too on the side
            of a hill so steep, one is ready to conclude that they were some feet
            below, as the earth would naturally wear more or less in that length of
            time. But they being placed toward the top of the hill, the ground would
            not remove as much as at two-thirds, perhaps.
            Another circumstance would prevent a wearing of the earth: in all probability,
            as soon as timber had time to grow, the hill was covered, after the Nephites
            were destroyed, and the roots of the same would hold the surface. However,
            on this point I shall leave every man to draw his own conclusion, and form
            his own speculation, as I only promised to give a
            description of the place at the time the records were found in 1823. It
            is sufficient for my present purpose, to know, that such is the fact: that
            in 1823, yes, 1823, a man with whom I have had the most intimate and personal
            acquaintance, for almost seven years, actually
            discovered by the vision of God, the plates from which the
            Book of Mormon,
            as much as it is disbelieved, was translated! Such is the case, though
            men rack their verry brains to invent falsehood, and then waft them upon
            every breeze, to the contrary notwithstanding.

            I have now given sufficient on the subject of the hill Cumorah—it has
            a singular and imposing appearance for that country, and must excite the
            curious enquiry of every lover of the Book of Mormon:
            though I hope never like Jerusalem and the sepulcher of our Lord, the
            pilgrims. In my estimation, certain places are dearer to me for what they
            now contain than for what they have contained. For the satisfaction of
            such as believe I have been thus particular, and to avoid the question
            being a thousand times asked, more than any other cause, shall proceed
            and be as particular as heretofore. The manner in which the plates were
            deposited:
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <span>
            First, a hole of sufficient depth, (how deep I know not) was dug. At the
            bottom of this
            was laid a stone of suitable size, the upper surface being smooth. At
            each edge was placed a large quantity of cement, and into this cement,
            at the four edges of this stone, were placed, erect, four others, their
            bottom edges resting in the cement at the outer edges of the first stone.
            The four last named, when placed erect, formed a box, the corners, or where
            the edges of the four came in contact, were also cemented so firmly that
            the moisture from
            without was prevented from entering. It is to be observed, also, that
            the inner surface of the four erect, or side stones was smooth. This box
            was sufficiently large to admit a breast- plate, such as was used by the
            ancients to defend the chest, &amp;c. from the arrows and
            weapons of their enemy. From the bottom of the box, or from the breast-plate,
            arose three small pillars composed of the same description of cement used
            on the edges; and upon these three pillars was placed the record of the
            children of Joseph, and of a people who left the tower far, far before
            the days of Joseph, or a sketch of each, which had it not been for this,
            and the never failing goodness of God, we might have perished in our sins,
            having been left to bow down before the altars of the Gentiles and to have
            paid homage to the
            priests of Baal! I must not forget to say that this box, containing the
            record was covered with another stone, the bottom surface being flat and
            the upper, crowning. But those three pillars were not so lengthy as to
            cause the plates and the crowning stone to come in
            contact. I have now given you, according to my promise, the manner in
            which this record was deposited; though when it was first visited by our
            brother, in 1823, a part of the
            crowning stone was visible above the surface while the edges were concealed
            by the soil and grass, from which circumstances you will see, that however
            deep this box might have been placed by Moroni at first, the time had been
            sufficient to wear the earth so that it was easily discovered when once
            directed, and yet not enough to make a perceivable difference to the passer-by.
            So wonderful are the works of the Almighty, and so far from our finding
            out are his ways, that one who trembles to take his holy name into his
            lips, is left to
            wonder at his exact providences, and the fulfilment of his purposes in
            the event of times and seasons.

            A few years sooner might have found even the top stone concealed, and
            discouraged our brother from attempting to make a further trial to obtain
            this rich treasure, for fear of
            discovery; and a few latter might have left the small box uncovered, and
            exposed its valuable contents to the rude calculations and vain speculations
            of those who neither understand common language nor fear God.

            But such would have been contrary to the words of the ancients and the
            promises made to them: and this is why I am left to admire the works and
            see the wisdom in the designs of the Lord in all things manifested to the
            eyes of the world: they show that all human
            inventions are like the vapors, while his word endures forever and his
            promises to the last generation.

            Having thus digressed from my main subject to give a few items for the
            special benefit of all, it will be necessary to return, and proceed as
            formerly.

            And if any suppose I have indulged too freely in reflections, I will only
            say that it is my opinion, were one to have a view of the glory of God
            which is to cover Israel in the last days, and know that these, though
            they may be thought small things, were the beginning to effect the same,
            they would be at a loss where to close, should they give a moment’s
            vent to the imaginations of the heart

            You will have wondered, perhaps, that the mind of our brother should be
            occupied with the thoughts of the goods of this world, at the time of arriving
            at Cumorah, on the
            morning of the 22
        </span><superscript><span>nd</span></superscript><span>
            of September, 1823, after having been rapt in the visions of heaven during
            the night, and also seeing and hearing in open day; but the mind of man
            is easily turned, if it is not held by the power of God through the prayer
            of faith, and you will
            remember that I have said that two invisible powers were operating upon
            his mind during his walk from his residence to Cumorah, and that the one
            urging the certainty of wealth and ease in this life, had so powerfully
            wrought upon him, that the great object so
            carefully and impressively named by the angel had entirely gone from his
            recollection that only a fixed determination to obtain now urged him forward.
            In this, which occasioned a failure to obtain, at that time, the record,
            do not understand me to attach blame to our brother: he was young, and
            his mind easily turned from correct principles, unless he could be favored
            with a certain round of experience. And yet, while young, untraditionated
            and untaught in the systems of the world, he was in a situation to be lead
            into the great work of God, and be qualified to perform it in due time.

            After arriving at the repository, a little exertion in removing the soil
            from the edges of the top of the box, and a light pry, brought to his natural
            vision its contents. No sooner did he behold this sacred treasure than
            his hopes were renewed, and he supposed his success
            certain; and without first attempting to take it from its long place of
            deposit, he thought, perhaps, there might be something more, equally as
            valuable, and to take only the plates, might give others an opportunity
            of obtaining the remainder, which could he secure, would still add to his
            store of wealth. These, in short, were his reflections, without once thinking
            of the solemn instruction of the heavenly messenger, that all must be done
            with an express view of glorifying God.

        <span>
            On attempting to take possession of the records a shock was produced upon
            his system, by an invisible power, which deprived him in a measure, of
            his natural strength. He desisted for an instant, and then made another
            attempt, but was more sensibly shocked than before. What was the occasion
            of this he knew not—there was the pure unsullied record, as had been described—he
            had heard of the power, of enchantment, and a thousand like stories, which
            held the hidden treasures of the earth, and supposed that physical exertion
            and personal strength was only necessary to enable him to yet obtain the
            object of his wish. He
            therefore made the third attempt with an increased exertion, when his
            strength failed him more than at either of the former times, and without
            premeditation he exclaimed, “Why can I not obtain this book?” “Because
            you have not kept the commandments of the
            Lord,” answered a voice, within a seeming short distance. He looked, and
            to his astonishment, there stood the angel who had previously given him
            the directions concerning this matter. In an instant, all the former instructions,
            the great intelligence concerning Israel and the last days, were brought
            to his mind: he thought of the time
            when his heart was fervently engaged in prayer to the Lord, when his spirit
            was contrite, and when his holy messenger, from the skies unfolded the
            wonderful things connected with this record. He had come, to be sure, and
            found the word of the angel fulfilled
            concerning the reality of the record but he had failed to remember the
            great end for which they had been kept, and in consequence could not have
            power to take them into his possession and bear them away.

            At that instant he looked to the Lord in prayer, and as he prayed darkness
            began to
            disperse from his mind and his soul was lit up as it was the evening before,
            and he was
            filled with the Holy Spirit; and again did the Lord manifest his condescension
            and mercy: the heavens were opened and the glory of the Lord shone round
            about and rested upon him. While he thus stood gazing and admiring, the
            angel said, “Look!” and as he thus spake he beheld the prince of darkness,
            surrounded by his innumerable train of associates.

                    All this is shown, the good and the evil, the holy and impure, the glory
                    of God and the power of darkness, that you may know hereafter the two powers
                    and never be influenced or overcome by that wicked one.
                </span><note><span>Moroni 7:13–14</span></note><span>
                    Behold, whatever
                    entices and leads to good and to do good, is of God, and whatever does
                    not is of that wicked one. It is he
                    that fills the hearts of men with evil, to walk in darkness and blaspheme
                    God; and you may learn from henceforth, that his ways are to destruction,
                    but the way of holiness is peace and rest.

                    You now see why you could not obtain this record; that the commandment
                    was strict, and that if ever these sacred things are obtained they must
                    be by prayer and
                    faithfulness in obeying the Lord. They are not deposited here for the
                    sake of
                    accumulating gain and wealth for the glory of this world: they were sealed
                    by the prayer of faith, and because of the knowledge which they contain
                    they are of no worth among the children of men, only for their knowledge.
                    On them is contained
                    the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ, as it was given to his people
                    on this land, and when it shall be brought forth by the power of God it
                    shall be carried to the Gentiles, of whom many will receive it, and after
                    will the seed of Israel be brought into the fold of their Redeemer by obeying
                    it also. Those who kept the commandments of the Lord on this land, desired
                    this at his hand, and through the prayer of faith obtained the promise,
                    that if their descendants should transgress and fall away, that a record
                    might be kept and in the last days come to their children. These things
                    are sacred, and must be kept so, for the promise of the Lord concerning
                    them must be fulfilled. No man
                    can obtain them if his heart is impure, because they contain that which
                    is sacred; and besides, should they be entrusted in unholy hands the knowledge
                    could not come to the world, because they cannot be interpreted by the
                    learning of this generation; consequently, they would be considered of
                    no worth, only as precious metal.

                    of the wise shall become as naught, and the understanding of the prudent

                    deceit, shall tremble with anger; but with signs and with wonders, with
                    gifts and with healings, with the manifestations of the power of God, and
                    with the Holy Ghost, shall the hearts of the faithful be comforted.

                    unspeakable surrounds them. There they rest beyond the power of the enemy
                    of truth, where no evil can disturb them. The glory of God crowns them,
                    and they continually feast upon his goodness and enjoy his smiles.

                    Behold, notwithstanding you have seen this great display of power, by
                    which you may ever be able to detect the evil one, yet I give unto you
                    another sign, and when it comes to pass then know that the Lord is God
                    and that he will fulfil his purposes, and that the knowledge which this
                    record contains will go to every nation, and kindred and tongue, and people
                    under the whole heaven. This is the sign: When these things begin to be
                    known, that is, when it is known that the Lord has shown you these things,
                    the workers of iniquity will seek your overthrow: they will circulate
                    falsehoods to destroy your reputation, and also will seek to take your
                    life; but remember this, if you are faithful, and shall hereafter continue
                    to keep the
                    commandments of the Lord, you shall be preserved to bring these things
                    forth; for in due time he will again give you a commandment to come and
                    take them. When they are interpreted the Lord will give the holy priesthood
                    to some, and they shall begin to proclaim this gospel and baptize by water,
                    and after that they shall have power to give the Holy Ghost by the laying
                    on of their hands. Then will persecution rage more and more; for the iniquities
                    of men shall be revealed, and those who are not built upon the Rock will
                    seek to overthrow this church; but it will increase the more opposed, and
                    spread farther and farther, increasing in knowledge till they shall be
                    sanctified and
                    receive an inheritance where the glory of God will rest upon them; and
                    when this takes place, and all things are prepared, the ten tribes of Israel
                    will be revealed in the north country, whither they have been for a long
                    season; and when this is fulfilled will be brought to pass that saying
                    of the prophets:

                    But, notwithstanding the workers of iniquity shall seek your destruction
                    the arm of the Lord will be extended, and you will be borne off conqueror
                    if you keep all his commandments. Your name shall be known among the nations,
                    for the work which the Lord will perform by your hands shall cause the
                    righteous to rejoice and the
                    wicked to rage: with the one it shall be had in honor, and with the other
                    in reproach; yet, with these it shall be a terror because of the great
                    and marvelous work which shall follow the coming forth of this fulness
                    of the gospel. Now, go thy way, remembering what the Lord has done for
                    thee, and be diligent in keeping his commandments, and he will deliver
                    thee from temptations and all the arts and devises of the wicked one.
                    Forget not to pray, that thy mind may become strong, that when he shall
                    manifest unto thee, thou mayest have power to escape the evil, and obtain
                    these precious things.

            Though I am unable to paint before the mind, a perfect description of
            the scenery which passed before our brother, I think I have said enough
            to give you a field for reflection
            which may not be unprofitable. You see the great wisdom in God in leading
            him thus far, that his mind might begin to be more matured, and thereby
            be able to judge correctly, the
            spirits. I do not say that he would not have obtained the record had he
            went according to the direction of the angel—I say that he would; but God
            knowing all things from the beginning, began thus to instruct his servant.
            And in this it is plainly to be seen that the adversary of truth is not
            sufficient to overthrow the work of God. You will remember
            that I said, two invisible powers were operating upon the mind of our
            brother while going to Cumorah. In this, then, I discover wisdom in the
            dealings of the Lord: it was impossible for any man to translate the
            Book of Mormon
            by the gift of God, and endure the
            afflictions, and temptations, and devices of Satan, without being overthrown
            unless he had been previously benefited with a certain round of experience:
            and had our brother obtained the record the first time, not knowing how
            to detect the works of darkness, he might have been deprived of the blessings
            of sending forth the word of truth to this
            generation. Therefore, God knowing that Satan would thus lead his mind
            astray, began at that early hour, that when the full time should arrive,
            he might have a servant prepared to fulfill his purpose. So, however afflicting
            to his feelings this repulse might have been, he had reason to rejoice
            before the Lord and be thankful for the favors and mercies shown; that
            whatever other instruction was necessary to the accomplishing this great
            work, he had learned, by experience, how to discern between the spirit
            of Christ and the spirit of the
            devil.

            Your humble servant, Joseph Smith, Jun., prisoner for the Lord Jesus Christ's
            sake, and for the Saints, taken and held by the power of mobocracy, under
            the exterminating reign of his excellency, the Governor Lilburn W. Boggs,
            in company with his fellow prisoners and beloved brethren, Caleb Baldwin,
            Lyman Wight, Hyrum Smith, and Alexander McRae, send unto you all greeting.
            May the grace of God the Father, and of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ,
            rest upon you all, and abide with you forever. May knowledge be multiplied
            unto you by the mercy of God. And may faith and virtue, and knowledge and
            temperance, and patience and godliness, and brotherly kindness and charity
            be in you and abound, that you may not be barren in anything, nor unfruitful.

            For inasmuch as we know that the most of you are well acquainted with
            the wrongs and the high-handed injustice and cruelty that are practiced
            upon us; whereas we have been taken prisoners charged falsely with every
            kind of evil, and a strong guard, who
            continually watch day and night as indefatigable as the devil does in
            tempting and laying snares for the people of God.
        </span>

        <span>
            Therefore, dearly beloved Brethren, we are the more ready and willing
            to lay claim to your fellowship and love. For our circumstances are calculated
            to awaken our spirits to a sacred remembrance of everything, and we think
            that yours are also, and that nothing therefore can separate us from the
            love of God and fellowship one with another; and that
            every species of wickedness and cruelty practiced upon us will only tend
            to bind our hearts together and seal them together in love. We have no
            need to say to you that we are held in bonds without cause, neither is
            it needful that you say unto us. We are driven from our homes and smitten
            without cause. We mutually understand that if the inhabitants of the state
            of Missouri had let the Saints alone, and had been as desirable of peace
            as they were, there would have been nothing but peace and quietude in the
            state unto this day; we
            should not have been in this hell, surrounded with demons (if not those
            who are damned, they are those who shall be damned) and where we are compelled
            to hear nothing but
            blasphemous oaths, and witness a scene of blasphemy, and drunkenness and
            hypocrisy, and debaucheries of every description.

            And again the cries of orphans and widows would not have ascended up to
            God against them. Nor would innocent blood have stained the soil of Missouri.
            But oh! the
            unrelenting hand! The inhumanity and murderous disposition of this people!
            It shocks all nature; it beggars and defies all description; it is a tale
            of woe; a lamentable tale; yea a
            sorrowful tale; too much to tell; too much for contemplation; too much
            for human beings; it cannot be found among the heathens; it cannot be found
            among the nations where kings and tyrants are enthroned; it cannot be found
            among the savages of the wilderness; yea, and I think it cannot be found
            among the wild and ferocious beasts of the forest—that a man should be
            mangled for sport! women be robbed of all that they have—their last morsel
            for subsistence, and then be violated to gratify the hellish desires of
            the mob, and
            finally left to perish with their helpless offspring clinging around their
            necks.

            But this is not all. After a man is dead, he must be dug up from his grave
            and mangled to pieces, for no other purpose than to gratify their spleen
            against the religion of God.

            They practice these things upon the Saints, who have done them no wrong,
            who are innocent and virtuous; who loved the Lord their God, and were willing
            to forsake all things for Christ's sake. These things are awful to
            relate, but they are verily true. It must needs be that offenses come,
            but woe unto them by whom they come.

            Dearly and beloved Brethren, we see that perilous times have come, as
            was testified of. We may look, then, with most perfect assurance, for the
            fulfillment of all those things that have been written, and with more confidence
            than ever before, lift up our eyes to the luminary of day, and say in our
            hearts, Soon thou wilt veil thy blushing face. He that said "Let there
            be Light," and there was light, has spoken this word. And again, thou
            moon, thou dimmer light, thou luminary of night, shalt turn to blood.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <span>
            We see that everything is being fulfilled; and that the time shall soon
            come when the Son of Man shall descend in the clouds of heaven. Our hearts
            do not shrink, neither are our spirits altogether broken by the grievous
            yoke which is put upon us. We know that God will have our oppressors in
            derision; that He will laugh at their calamity, and mock when their fear
            comes.

        <span>
            O that we could be with you, Brethren, and unbosom our feelings to you!
            We would tell, that we should have been liberated at the time Elder Rigdon
            was, on the writ of habeas corpus, had not our own lawyers interpreted
            the law, contrary to what it reads, against us; which prevented us from
            introducing our evidence before the mock court.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <span>
            They have done us much harm from the beginning. They have of late acknowledged
            that the law was misconstrued, and tantalized our feelings with it, and
            have entirely forsaken us, and have forfeited their oaths and their bonds;
            and we have a come-back on them, for they are co-workers with the mob.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <span>
            As nigh as we can learn, the public mind has been for a long time turning
            in our favor, and the majority in now friendly; and the lawyers can no
            longer browbeat us by saying that this or that is a matter of public opinion,
            for public opinion is not willing to brook it; for it is beginning to look
            with feelings of indignation against our oppressors, and to say that the
            Mormons were not in the fault in the least. We think that truth, honor,
            virtue and
            innocence will eventually come out triumphant. We should have taken a
            habeas corpus before the high judge and escaped the mob in a summary way;
            but unfortunately for us, the timber of the wall being very hard, our auger
            handles gave out, and hindered us longer
            than we expected; we applied to a friend, and a very slight incautious
            act gave rise to some suspicions, and before we could fully succeed, our
            plan was discovered; we had everything in readiness, but the last stone,
            and we could have made our escape in one minute, and should have succeeded
            admirably, had it not been for a little imprudence or over-anxiety on the
            part of our friend.
        </span>

    <block>
        <span>
            The sheriff and jailer did not blame us for our attempt; it was a fine
            breach, and cost the county a round sum; but public opinion says that we
            ought to have been permitted to have made our escape; that then the disgrace
            would have been on us, but now it must come on the state; that there cannot
            be any charge sustained against us; and that the
            conduct of the mob, the murders committed at Haun's Mills, and the
            exterminating order of the governor, and the one-sided, rascally proceedings
            of the legislature, have damned the state of Missouri to all eternity.
            I would just name also that General Atchison has proved himself as contemptible
            as any of them.

        <span>
            We have tried for a long time to get our lawyers to draw us some petitions
            to the supreme judges of this state, but they utterly refused. We have
            examined the law, and drawn the petitions ourselves, and have obtained
            abundance of proof to counteract all the testimony that was against us,
            so that if the supreme judge does not grant us our liberty, he has to act
            without cause, contrary to honor, evidence, law or justice, sheerly to
            please the devil, but we hope better things and trust before many days
            God will so order our case, that we shall be set at liberty and take up
            our habitation with the saints.

            We received some letters last evening—one from Emma, one from Don C. Smith,
            and one from Bishop Partridge—all breathing a kind and consoling spirit.
            We were much
            gratified with their contents. We had been a long time without information;
            and when we read those letters they were to our souls as the gentle air
            is refreshing, but our joy was mingled with grief, because of the sufferings
            of the poor and much injured saints. And we need not say to you that the
            floodgates of our hearts were lifted and our eyes were a
            fountain of tears, but those who have not been enclosed in the walls of
            prison without
            cause or provocation, can have but little idea how sweet the voice of
            a friend is; one token of friendship from any source whatever awakens and
            calls into action every sympathetic
            feeling; it brings up in an instant everything that is passed; it seizes

            one thing to another, until finally all enmity, malice and hatred, and
            past differences, misunderstandings and mismanagements are slain
            victorious at the feet of hope; and when the heart is sufficiently contrite,

            And now, beloved brethren, we say unto you, that inasmuch as God has said
            that he
            would have a tried people, that he would purge them as gold, now we think
            that this time he has chosen his own crucible, wherein we have been tried;
            and we think if we get through with any degree of safety, and shall have
            kept the faith, that it will be a sign to this generation, altogether sufficient
            to leave them without excuse; and we think also, it will be a trial of
            our faith equal to that of Abraham, and that the ancients will not have
            whereof to boast over us in the day of judgment, as being called to pass
            through heavier afflictions; that we may hold an even weight in the balance
            with them; but now, after having suffered so great sacrifice and having
            passed through so great a season of sorrow, we trust that a ram may be
            caught in the thicket speedily, to relieve the sons and
            daughters of Abraham from their great anxiety, and to light up the lamp
            of salvation upon their countenances, that they may hold on now, after
            having gone so far unto everlasting life.

            Now, brethren, concerning the places for the location of the saints, we
            cannot counsel you as we could if we were present with you; and as to the
            things that were written heretofore, we did not consider them anything
            very binding, therefore we now say once for all, that we think it most
            proper that the general affairs of the church, which are necessary to be
            considered, while your humble servant remains in bondage, should be transacted
            by a general conference of the most faithful and the most respectable of
            the authorities of the church, and a minute of those transactions may be
            kept, and forwarded from time to time, to your humble servant; and if there
            should be any corrections by the word of the Lord, they shall be freely
            transmitted, and your humble servant will approve all things
            whatsoever is acceptable unto God. If anything should have been suggested
            by us, or any names mentioned, except by commandment, or thus says the
            Lord, we do not consider it binding; therefore our hearts shall not be
            grieved if different arrangements should be entered into. Nevertheless
            we would suggest the propriety of being aware of an aspiring
            spirit, which spirit has oftentimes urged men forward to make foul speeches,
            and influence the church to reject milder counsels, and has eventually
            been the means of bringing much death and sorrow upon the church.

            We would say, beware of pride also; for well and truly has the wise man
            said, that pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a
            fall. And again, outward appearance is not always a criterion by which
            to judge our fellow man; but the lips betray the haughty
            and overbearing imaginations of the heart; by his words and his deeds
            let him be judged.
            Flattery is also a deadly poison. A frank and open rebuke provokes a good
            man to
            emulation; and in the hour of trouble he will be your best friend; but
            on the other hand, it will draw out all the corruptions of corrupt hearts,
            and lying and the poison of asps is
            under their tongues; and they do cause the pure in heart to be cast into
            prison, because they want them out of their way.

            A fanciful and flowery and heated imagination beware of; because the things
            of God are of deep import; and time, and experience, and careful and ponderous
            and solemn thoughts
            can only find them out. Thy mind, O man! if thou wilt lead a soul unto
            salvation, must stretch as high as the utmost Heavens, and search into
            and contemplate the lowest considerations of the darkest abyss, and expand
            upon the broad considerations of Eternal Expanse, he must commune with
            God. How much more dignified and noble are the
            thoughts of God, than the vain imaginations of the human heart! None but
            fools will trifle with the souls of men.

            How vain and trifling have been our spirits, our conferences, our councils,
            our private meetings, our private as well as public conversations—too low,
            too mean, too vulgar, too condescending for the dignified characters of
            the called and chosen of God, according to the purposes of His will, from
            before the foundation of the world! We are called to hold the keys of the
            mysteries of those things that have been kept hid from the foundation of
            the world until now. Some have tasted a little of these things, many of
            which are to be poured down from heaven upon the heads of babes; yea, upon
            the weak, obscure and
            despised ones of the earth. Therefore we beseech of you, brethren, that
            you bear with those who do not feel themselves more worthy than yourselves,
            while we exhort one another to a reformation with one and all, both old
            and young, teachers and taught, both high and low, rich and poor, bond
            and free, male and female; let honesty, and sobriety, and candor, and solemnity,
            and virtue, and pureness, and meekness, and simplicity crown our heads
            in every place; and in fine, become as little children, without malice,
            guile or hypocrisy.

            of the prosperity of this church; like the torrent of rain from the mountains,
            that floods the most pure and crystal stream with
            mire, and dirt, and filthiness, and obscures everything that was clear
            before, and all rushes
            along in one general deluge; but time weathers tide; and notwithstanding
            we are rolled in the mire of the flood for the time being, the next surge
            peradventure, as time rolls on, may bring to us the fountain as clear as
            crystal, and as pure as snow; while the filthiness,
            flood-wood and rubbish is left and purged out by the way.

            torrents send down mire and roil the crystal stream, although afterwards
            render it more pure than before; or that fire is not fire, because it is

            may learn it, that walls and irons, doors and creaking hinges, and half-scared-to-death
            guards and jailers, grinning like some damned spirits, lest an innocent
            man should make his escape to bring to light the damnable deeds of a murderous

            I send this epistle to Emma that she may have the first perusal of it.
            We feel to inquire after Elder Rigdon; if he has not forgotten us, it has
            not been signified to us by his writing. Brother George W. Robinson also;
            and Elder Cahoon, we remember him, but would like to jog his memory a little
            on the fable of the bear and the two friends who mutually
            agreed to stand by each other. And perhaps it would not be amiss to mention
            uncle John [Smith], and various others. A word of consolation and a blessing
            would not come amiss
            from anybody, while we are being so closely whispered by the bear. But
            we feel to excuse everybody and everything, yea the more readily when we
            contemplate that we are in the hands of persons worse than a bear, for
            the bear would not prey upon a dead carcass.

            It still seems to bear heavily on our minds that the church would do well
            to secure to themselves the contract of the land, which is proposed to
            them by Mr. Isaac Galland, and to cultivate the friendly feelings of that
            gentleman, inasmuch as he shall prove himself to be a man of honor and
            a friend to humanity; also Isaac Van Allen, Esq., the attorney- general
            of Iowa Territory, and Governor Lucas, that peradventure such men may be
            wrought upon by the providence of God, to do good unto his people. We
            really think that Mr. Galland's letter breathes that kind of a spirit,
            if we may judge correctly. Governor
            Lucas' also. We suggest the idea of praying fervently for all men
            who manifest any degree of sympathy for the suffering children of God.

            We think that the United States Surveyor of the Iowa Territory may be
            of great benefit to the church, if it be the will of God to this end; and
            righteousness should be manifested as the girdle of our loins.

            It seems to be deeply impressed upon our minds that the saints ought to
            lay hold of every door that shall seem to be opened unto them, to obtain
            foothold on the earth, and be making all the preparation that is within
            their power for the terrible storms that are now gathering in the heavens,
            "a day of clouds, with darkness and gloominess, and of thick
            darkness," as spoken of by the prophets which cannot be now of a
            long time lingering, for there seems to be a whispering that the angels
            of heaven who have been entrusted with the counsel of these matters for
            the last days, have taken counsel together; and among the rest of the general
            affairs that have to be transacted in their honorable council, they have
            taken cognizance of the testimony of those who were murdered at Haun's
            Mills, and also those who were martyred with D.W. Patten, and elsewhere,
            and have passed some decisions
            peradventure in favor of the saints, and those who were called to suffer
            without cause.

            We have a fervent desire that in your general conferences everything should
            be discussed with a great deal of care and propriety, lest you grieve the
            Holy Spirit, which shall be poured out at all times upon your heads, when
            you are exercised with those principles of righteousness that are agreeable
            to the mind of God, and are properly affected one toward another, and are
            careful by all means to remember, those who are in bondage, and in
            heaviness, and in deep affliction for your sakes. And if there are any
            among you who aspire after their own aggrandizement, and seek their own
            opulence, while their brethren are groaning in poverty, and are under sore
            trials and temptations, they cannot be
            benefited by the intercession of the Holy Spirit, which makes intercession
            for us day and night with groanings that cannot be uttered.

            with all long-suffering bear the infirmities of the weak.

                    that the rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the powers

            Now, brethren, I would suggest for the consideration of the conference,
            it being carefully and wisely understood by the council or conferences
            that our brethren scattered abroad,
            who understood the spirit of the gathering, that they fall into the places
            and refuge of safety that God shall open unto them, between Kirtland and
            Far West. Those from the
            east and from the west, and from far countries, let them fall in somewhere
            between those two boundaries, in the most safe and quiet places they can
            find; and let this be the present understanding, until God shall open a
            more effectual door for us for further
            considerations.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <span>
            And again, we further suggest for the considerations of the council, that
            there be no organization of large bodies upon common stock principles,
            in property, or of large companies of firms, until the Lord shall signify
            it in a proper manner, as it opens such a dreadful field for the avaricious,
            the indolent, and the corrupt hearted to prey upon the innocent and virtuous,
            and honest.
        </span>
    </block>

    <block>
        <span>
            We have reason to believe that many things were introduced among the saints
            before God had signified the times; and notwithstanding the principles
            and plans may have been good, yet aspiring men, or in other words, men
            who had not the substance of Godliness about them, perhaps undertook to
            handle edged tools. Children, you know, are fond of tools,
            while they are not yet able to use them.

            Time and experience, however, are the only safe remedies against such
            evils. There are many teachers, but, perhaps, not many Fathers. There are
            times coming when God will signify many things which are expedient for
            the well-being of the Saints; but the times have not yet come, but will
            come, as fast as there can be found place and reception for them.

                    that are afloat;

                    which shall call him forth from his hiding place; and also that the whole

                    they lie in wait to deceive, and who are only kept from the truth because
                    they know not where to find it—
                </span><verse>13</verse><span>
                    therefore, that we should waste and wear out our lives in bringing to
                    light all the hidden things of darkness, wherein we know them; and they
                    are truly manifest from heaven—
                </span><verse>14</verse><span>
                    these should then be attended to with great earnestness.
                </span><verse>15</verse><span>
                    Let no man count them as small things; for there is much which lies in
                    futurity, pertaining to the saints,
                    which depends upon these things.

                    You know, brethren, that a very large ship is benefited very much by a
                    very small helm in the time of a storm, by being kept workways with the
                    wind and the waves.
                </span><verse>17</verse><span>
                    Therefore, dearly beloved brethren, let us cheerfully do all things that
                    lie in our power; and then may we stand still, with the utmost assurance,
                    to see the salvation of God, and for his arm to be revealed.

            And again, I would further suggest the impropriety of the organization
            of bands or companies, by covenant or oaths, by penalties or secrecies;
            but let the time past of our
            experience and sufferings by the wickedness of Doctor Avard suffice and
            let our covenant be that of the everlasting covenant, as is contained in
            the Holy Writ and the things that God has revealed unto us. Pure friendship
            always becomes weakened the very moment you undertake to make it stronger
            by penal oaths and secrecy.

            Your humble servant or servants, intend from henceforth to disapprobate
            everything that is not in accordance with the fulness of the gospel of
            Jesus Christ, and is not of a bold, and frank, and upright nature. They
            will not hold their peace—as in times past when they see iniquity beginning
            to rear its head—for fear of traitors, or the consequences that shall
            follow by reproving those who creep in unawares, that they may get something
            with
            which to destroy the flock. We believe that the experience of the Saints
            in times past has been sufficient, that they will from henceforth be always
            ready to obey the truth without having men's persons in admiration
            because of advantage.

            It is expedient that we should be aware of such things; and we ought always
            to be aware of those prejudices which sometimes so strangely present themselves,
            and are so congenial to human nature, against our friends, neighbors, and
            brethren of the world, who choose to differ from us in opinion and in matters
            of faith. Our religion is between us and our God. Their religion is between
            them and their God.

            There is a love from God that should be exercised toward those of our
            faith, who walk uprightly, which is peculiar to itself, but it is without
            prejudice; it also gives scope to the
            mind, which enables us to conduct ourselves with greater liberality towards
            all that are not of our faith, than what they exercise towards one another.
            These principles approximate nearer to the mind of God, because it is like
            God, or Godlike.

            There is a principle also, which we are bound to be exercised with, that
            is, in common with all men, such as governments, and laws, and regulations
            in the civil concerns of life. This principle guarantees to all parties,
            sects, and denominations, and classes of religion, equal, coherent, and
            indefeasible rights; they are things that pertain to this life; therefore
            all are alike interested; they make our responsibilities one towards another
            in matters of corruptible things, while the former principles do not destroy
            the latter, but bind us
            stronger, and make our responsibilities not only one to another, but unto
            God also. Hence we say, that the Constitution of the United States is a
            glorious standard; it is founded in
            the wisdom of God. It is a heavenly banner; it is to all those who are
            privileged with the sweets of liberty, like the cooling shades and refreshing
            waters of a great rock in a thirsty and weary land. It is like a great
            tree under whose branches men from every clime can be shielded from the
            burning rays of an inclement sun.

            We, brethren, are deprived of the protection of its glorious principles,
            by the cruelty of the cruel, by those who only look for the time being,
            for pasturage like the beasts of the field, only to fill themselves; and
            forget that the Mormons, as well as the Presbyterians,
            and those of every other class and description, have equal rights to partake
            of the fruits of the great tree of our national liberty. But notwithstanding
            we see what we see, and feel what we feel, and know what we know, yet that
            fruit is no less precious and delicious to our taste; we cannot be weaned
            from the milk, neither can we be driven from the breast; neither will we
            deny our religion because of the hand of oppression; but we will hold on
            until death.

            We say that God is true; that the Constitution of the United States is
            true; that the Bible is true; that the Book of Mormon
            is true; that the Book Of Covenants
            is true; that Christ is true; that the ministering angels sent forth from
            God are true, and that we know that we have an house not made with hands,
            eternal in the heavens, whose builder and maker is God; a consolation which
            our oppressors cannot feel, when fortune, or fate, shall lay its iron hand
            on them as it has on us. Now, we ask, what is man? Remember, brethren,
            that time and chance happen to all men.

            your sincere friends and brethren in the bonds of the everlasting Gospel,
            prisoners of Jesus Christ, for the sake of the Gospel and the Saints. We
            pronounce the blessings of heaven upon the heads of the Saints who seek
            to serve God with undivided hearts, in the name of Jesus Christ,
