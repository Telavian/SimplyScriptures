            In 1835, Oliver Cowdery wrote a series of letters which were published
            throughout the year in the
            </span><italic><span>Messenger and Advocate</span></italic><span>
            newspaper. Several of these letters provided a detailed account of Joseph’s
            experiences in September1823 when an angel visited him and told him about
            the plates. This section contains key extracts from those letters.

        February 1835, Letter IV
    </span></heading>

        On the evening of the 21</span><superscript><span>st</span></superscript><span>
        of September, 1823, previous to retiring to rest, our brother’s mind was
        unusually wrought up on the subject which had so long agitated his mind—his
        heart was drawn out in fervent prayer, and his whole soul was so lost to
        everything of a temporal nature, that earth, to him, had lost its charms,
        and all he desired was to be
        prepared in heart to commune with some kind messenger who could communicate
        to him the desired information of his acceptance with God.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        At length the family retired, and he, as usual, bent his way, though in
        silence, where others might have rested their weary frames “locked fast
        in sleep’s embrace;” but repose had fled, and accustomed slumber had spread
        her refreshing hand over others beside him— he continued still to pray—his
        heart, though once hard and obdurate, was softened, and that mind which
        had often flitted, like the “wild bird of passage,” had settled upon a
        determined basis not to be decoyed or driven from its purpose.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        In this situation hours passed unnumbered—how many or how few I know not,
        neither is he able to inform me; but supposes it must have been eleven
        or twelve, and perhaps later, as the noise and bustle of the family, in
        retiring, had long since ceased. While continuing in prayer for a manifestation
        in some way that his sins were forgiven; endeavoring to
        exercise faith in the scriptures, on a sudden a light like that of day,
        only of a purer and far more glorious appearance and brightness, burst
        into the room. Indeed to use his own
        description, the first sight was as though the house was filled with consuming
        and unquenchable fire. This sudden appearance of a light so bright, as
        must naturally be
        expected, occasioned a shock or sensation, visible to the extremities
        of the body. It was, however, followed with a calmness and serenity of
        mind, and an overwhelming rapture of Joy that surpassed understanding,
        and in a moment a personage stood before him.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Notwithstanding the room was previously filled with light above the brightness
        of the sun, as I before described, yet there seemed to be an additional
        glory surrounding or accompanying this personage, which shone with an increased
        degree of brilliancy, of
        which he was in the midst; and though his countenance was as lightning,
        yet it was of a
        pleasing, innocent and glorious appearance, so much so, that every fear
        was banished from the heart, and nothing but calmness pervaded the soul.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        It is no easy task to describe the appearance of a messenger from the
        skies—indeed, I doubt their being an individual clothed with perishable
        clay, who is capable to do this work. To be sure, the Lord appeared to
        his apostles after his resurrection, and we do not learn as they were in
        the least difficultied to look upon him; but from John’s description upon
        Patmos, we learn that he is there represented as most glorious in appearance;
        and from other items in the sacred scriptures we have the fact recorded
        where angels appeared and conversed with men, and there was no difficulty
        on the part of the individuals, to endure their presence; and others where
        their glory was so conspicuous that they could not
        endure. The last description or appearance is the one to which I refer,
        when I say that it is no easy task to describe their glory.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        But it may be well to relate the particulars as far as given. The stature
        of this personage was a little above the common size of men in this age;
        his garment was perfectly white, and had the appearance of being without
        seam.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Though fear was banished from his heart, yet his surprise was no less
        when he heard him declare himself to be a messenger sent by commandment
        of the Lord, to deliver a special message and to witness to him that his
        sins were forgiven, and that his prayers were heard; and that the scriptures
        might be fulfilled, which say:

                For according to his covenant which he made with his ancient saints, his
                people, the house of Israel must come to a knowledge of the gospel, and
                own that Messiah whom their fathers rejected, and with them the fulness
                of the Gentiles be gathered in, to
                rejoice in one fold under one Shepherd”

                This cannot be brought about until first certain preparatory things are
                accomplished, for so has the Lord purposed in his own mind. He has therefore
                chosen you as an instrument in his hand to bring to light that which shall
                perform his act, his strange
                act, and bring to pass a marvelous work and a wonder. Wherever the sound
                shall go it shall cause the ears of men to tingle, and wherever it shall
                be proclaimed, the pure in heart shall rejoice, while those who draw near
                to God with their mouths, and honor him with their lips, while their hearts
                are far from him, will seek its overthrow, and the destruction of those
                by whose hands it is carried. Therefore, marvel not if your name is made
                a derision, and had as a by-word among such, if you are the instrument
                in bringing it, by the gift of God, to the knowledge of the people.

        He then proceeded and gave a general account of the promises made to the
        fathers, and also gave a history of the aborigines of this country, and
        said they were literal descendants of Abraham. He represented them as once
        being an enlightened and intelligent people, possessing a correct knowledge
        of the gospel, and the plan of restoration and redemption. He said this
        history was written and deposited not far from that place, and that it
        was our brother’s privilege, if obedient to the commandments of the Lord,
        to obtain and translate the same by the means of the Urim and Thummim,
        which were deposited for that
        purpose with the record.

        “Yet,” said he, “the scriptures must be fulfilled before it is translated,
        which says that the words of a book, which were sealed, were presented
        to the learned; for thus has God
        determined to leave men without excuse, and show to the meek that his
        arm is not shortened that it cannot save.”
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        A part of the book was sealed, and was not to be opened yet. The sealed
        part, said he, contains the same revelation which was given to John upon
        the isles of Patmos, and when the people of the Lord are prepared, and
        found worthy, then it will be unfolded unto them.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        On the subject of bringing to light the unsealed part of this record,
        it may be proper to say that our brother was expressly informed that it
        must be done with an eye single to the glory of God; if this consideration
        did not wholly characterize all his proceedings in
        relation to it, the adversary of truth would overcome him, or at least
        prevent his making that proficiency in this glorious work which he otherwise
        would.

        While describing the place where the record was deposited, he gave a minute
        relation of it, and the vision of his mind being opened at the same time,
        he was permitted to view it critically; and previously being acquainted
        with the place, he was able to follow the
        direction of the vision, afterward, according to the voice of the angel,
        and obtain the book.

        I gave, in my last, a few words, on the subject of a few items, as spoken
        by the angel at the time the knowledge of the record of the Nephites was
        communicated to our brother, and in consequence of the subject of the gospel
        and that of the gathering of Israel’s being so connected, I found it difficult
        to speak of the one without mentioning the other; and this may not be improper,
        as it is evident, that the Lord has decreed to bring forth the fulness
        of the gospel in the last days, previous to gathering Jacob, but a preparatory
        work, and the other is to follow in quick succession.

        This being of so much importance, and of so deep interest to the saints,
        I have thought best to give a farther detail of the heavenly message, and
        if I do not give it in the precise words, shall strictly confine myself
        to the facts in substance.

        This he said in view of the glorious period for which he often prayed,
        and was anxious to behold, which he knew could not take place until the
        knowledge of the glory of God covered all lands, or all the earth. Again
        he says:

                west from the north and
                from the south. They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they
                found no city to dwell in. Hungry and thirsty, their souls fainted in them.
                Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them out
                of their distresses; and led them in the right way that they might go to
                the city of habitations.

        Most clearly was it shown to the prophets, that the righteous should be
        gathered from all the earth: He knew that the children of Israel were led
        from Egypt, by the right hand of the Lord, and permitted to possess the
        land of Canaan, though they were rebellious in the desert but he farther
        knew, that they were not gathered from the east, the west, the north and
        the south, at that time; for it was clearly manifested that the Lord himself
        would
        prepare a habitation, even as he said, when he would lead them to a city
        of refuge.
        </span><note><span>Psalm 144:11–12</span></note><span>In that, David saw a promise for the righteous, when they should
        be delivered from those who oppressed them, and from the hand of strange
        children, or the enemies of the Lord; that their sons should be like plants
        grown up in their youth, and their daughters like corner- stones, polished
        after the similitude of a beautiful palace.
        </span><note><span>Joel 2:28</span></note><span>It is then that the sons and
        daughters shall prophesy, old men dream dreams, and young men see visions.
        At that time the garners of the righteous will be full, affording all manner
        of store. It was while contemplating this time, and viewing this happy
        state of the righteous, that he further says, “The Lord shall reign forever,
        even thy God, O Zion, unto all generations—Praise ye the Lord!”

        Isaiah, who was on the earth at the time the ten tribes of Israel were
        led away captive
        from the land of Canaan, was shown not only their calamity and affliction,
        but the time when they were to be delivered. After reproving them for their
        corruption and blindness, he prophesies of their dispersion. He says:

        I have now given you a rehearsal of what was communicated to our brother,
        when he was directed to go and obtain the record of the Nephites. I may
        have missed in arrangement in some instances, but the principle is preserved,
        and you will be able to bring forward
        abundance of corroborating scripture upon the subject of the gospel and
        of the gathering.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        You are aware of the fact, that to give a minute rehearsal of a lengthy
        interview with a heavenly messenger, is very difficult unless one is assisted
        immediately with the gift of inspiration. There is another item I wish
        to notice on the subject of visions. The Spirit, you know, searches all
        things, even the deep things of God. When God manifests to his
        servants those things that are to come, or those which have been, he does
        it by unfolding them by the power of that Spirit which comprehends all
        things, always; and so much may
        be shown and made perfectly plain to the understanding in a short time,
        that to the world, who are occupied all their life to learn a little, look
        at the relation of it, and are disposed to call it false. You will understand
        then by this, that while those glorious things were being rehearsed, the
        vision was also opened so that our brother was permitted to see and
        understand much more fully and perfectly than I am able to communicate
        in writing. I know much may be conveyed to the understanding in writing,
        and many marvelous
        truths set forth with the pen, but after all it is but a shadow, compared
        to an open vision of seeing, hearing and realizing eternal things. And
        if the fact was known, it would be found, that of all the heavenly communications
        to the ancients, we have no more in comparison than the alphabet to a quarto
        vocabulary.

        It is said, and I believe the account, that the Lord showed the brother
        of Jared
        (Moriancumer) all things which were to transpire from that day to the
        end of the earth, as well as those which had taken place. I believe that
        Moses was permitted to see the same, as the Lord caused them to pass, in
        vision before him as he stood upon the mount. I believe that the Lord Jesus
        told many things to his apostles which are not written, and after his
        ascension unfolded all things unto them. I believe that Nephi, the son
        of Lehi, whom the Lord brought out of Jerusalem, saw the same. I believe
        that the twelve upon this continent, whom the Lord chose to preach his
        gospel, when he came down to manifest to this branch of the house of Israel,
        that he had other sheep who should hear his voice, were also permitted
        to behold the same mighty things transpire in vision before their eyes.
        And I believe that the angel Moroni, whose words I have been rehearsing,
        who communicated the knowledge of the record of the Nephites in this age,
        saw also, before he hid up the same unto the Lord, great and marvelous
        things which were to transpire when the same should come forth; and I also
        believe, that God will give line upon line precept upon
        precept to his saints, until all these things will be unfolded to them,
        and they finally sanctified and brought into the Celestial glory, where
        tears will be wiped from all faces, and sighing and sorrowing flee away!

        July 1835 – Letter VII
    </span></heading>

    <block><span>
        You will remember that in my last I brought my subject down to the evening,
        or night of the 21</span><superscript><span>st</span></superscript><span>
        of September, 1823, and gave an outline of the conversation of the angel
        upon the important fact of the blessings, promises and covenants to Israel,
        and the great
        manifestations of favor to the world, in the ushering in of the fulness
        of the gospel, to
        prepare the way for the second advent of the Messiah, when he comes in
        the glory of the Father with the holy angels.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        A remarkable fact is to be noticed with regard to this vision. In ancient
        times the Lord warned some of his servants in dreams: for instance, Joseph,
        the husband of Mary, was warned in a dream to take the young child and
        his mother, and flee into Egypt: also, the
        wise men were warned of the Lord in a dream not to return to Herod; and
        when “out of Egypt the Son was called” the angel of the Lord appeared in
        a dream to Joseph again: also he was warned in a dream to turn aside into
        the parts of Galilee. Such were the
        manifestations to Joseph, the favored descendant of the father of the
        faithful in dreams, and in them the Lord fulfilled his purposes: But the
        one of which I have been speaking is what would have been called an open
        vision. And though it was in the night, yet it was not a dream. There is
        no room for conjecture in this matter, and to talk of deception would be
        to sport with the common sense of every man who knows when he is awake,
        when he sees and when he does not see.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        He could not have been deceived in the fact that a being of some kind
        appeared to him; and that it was an heavenly one, the fulfillment of his
        words, so minutely, up to this time, in addition to the truth and word
        of salvation which has been developed to this
        generation, in the Book of Mormon,
        ought to be conclusive evidence to the mind of every man who is privileged
        to hear of the same. He was awake, and in solemn prayer, as you will bear
        in mind, when the angel made his appearance; from that glory which
        surrounded him the room was lit up to a perfect brilliancy, so that darkness
        wholly disappeared: he heard his words with his ears, and received a joy
        and happiness
        indescribable by hearing that his own sins were forgiven, and his former
        transgressions to be remembered against him no more, if he then continued
        to walk before the Lord
        according to his holy commandments. He also saw him depart, the light
        and glory
        withdraw, leaving a calmness and peace of soul past the language of man
        to paint—was he deceived?
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Far from this; for the vision was renewed twice before morning, unfolding
        farther and still farther the mysteries of godliness and those things to
        come. In the morning he went. to his labor as usual, but soon the vision
        of the heavenly messenger was renewed, instructing him to go immediately
        and view those things of which he had been informed, with a promise that
        he should obtain them if he followed the directions and went with an eye
        single to the glory of God.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Accordingly he repaired to the place which had thus been described. But
        it is necessary to give you more fully the express instructions of the
        angel, with regard to the object of this work in which our brother had
        now engaged. He was to remember that it was the work of the Lord, to fulfil
        certain promises previously made to a branch of the house of Israel, of
        the tribe of Joseph, and when it should be brought forth must be done expressly
        with an eye, as I said before, single to the glory of God, and the welfare
        and restoration of the house of Israel.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        You will understand, then, that no motive of a pecuniary, or earthly nature,
        was to be
        suffered to take the lead of the heart of the man thus favored. The allurements
        of vice, the contaminating influence of wealth, without the direct guidance
        of the Holy Spirit, must have no place in the heart nor be suffered to
        take from it that warm desire for the glory and kingdom of the Lord, or
        instead of obtaining, disappointment and reproof would most assuredly follow.
        Such was the instruction and this the caution.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Alternately, as we could naturally expect, the thought of the previous
        vision was
        ruminating in his mind, with a reflection of the brightness and glory
        of the heavenly messenger; but again a thought would start across the mind
        on the prospects of obtaining so desirable a treasure—one in all human
        probability sufficient to raise him above a level with the common earthly
        fortunes of his fellow men, and relieve his family from want, in which,
        by misfortune and sickness they were placed.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        It is very natural to suppose that the mind would revolve upon those scenes
        which had passed, when those who had acquired a little of this world’s
        goods, by industry and economy, with the blessings of health or friends,
        or by art and intrigue from the pockets of the day-laborer, or the widow
        and the fatherless, had passed by with a stiff neck and a cold heart, scorning
        the virtuous because they were poor, and lording over those who were subjected
        to suffer the miseries of this life.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Alternately did these, with a swift reflection of the words of the holy
        messenger,—
        “Remember, that he who does this work, who is thus favored of the Lord,
        must do it with his eye single to the glory of the same, and the welfare
        and restoration of the scattered
        remnants of the house of Israel”—rush upon his mind with the quickness
        of electricity.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Here was a struggle indeed; for when he calmly reflected upon his errand,
        he knew that if God did not give, he could not obtain; and again, with
        the thought or hope of obtaining, his mind would be carried back to its
        former reflections of poverty, abuse,— wealth,
        grandeur and ease, until before arriving at the place described, this
        wholly occupied his desires; and when he thought upon the fact of what
        was previously shown him, it was only with an assurance that he should
        obtain, and accomplish his desires in relieving himself and friends from
        want.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        A history of the inhabitants who peopled this continent, previous to its
        being discovered to Europeans by Columbus, must be interesting to every
        man; and as it would develop the important fact, that the present race
        were descendants of Abraham, and were to be
        remembered in the immutable covenant of the Most High to that man, and
        be restored to a knowledge of the gospel, that they, with all nations might
        rejoice, seemed to inspire
        further thoughts of gain and income from such a valuable history. Surely,
        thought he
        every man will seize with eagerness, this knowledge, and this incalculable
        income will be mine. Enough to raise the expectations of any one of like
        inexperience, placed in similar
        circumstances. But the important point in this matter is, that man does
        not see as the Lord, neither are his purposes like his. The small things
        of this life are but dust in comparison
        with salvation and eternal life.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        It is sufficient to say that such were his reflections during his walk
        of from two to three miles: the distance from his father’s house to the
        place pointed out. And to use his own words it seemed as though two invisible
        powers were influencing or striving to influence his mind—one with the
        reflection that if he obtained the object of his pursuit, it would be through
        the mercy and condescension of the Lord, and that every act or performance
        in relation to it, must be in strict accordance with the instruction of that
        personage, who communicated the intelligence to him first; and the other
        with the thoughts and
        reflections like those previously mentioned—contrasting his former and
        present
        circumstances in life with those to come. That precious instruction recorded
        on the sacred page—pray always—which was expressly impressed upon him,
        was at length entirely forgotten, and as I previously remarked, a fixed
        determination to obtain and aggrandize himself, occupied his mind when
        he arrived at the place where the record was found.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        I must now give you some description of the place where, and the manner
        in which these records were deposited.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        You are acquainted with the mail road from Palmyra, Wayne Co. to Canandaigua,
        Ontario Co. N.Y. and also, as you pass from the former to the latter place,
        before arriving at the little village of Manchester, say from three to
        four, or about four miles from
        Palmyra, you pass a large hill on the east side of the road. Why I say
        large, is because it is as large perhaps, as any in that country. To a
        person acquainted with this road, a
        description would be unnecessary, as it is the largest and rises the highest
        of any on that route. The north end rises quite sudden until it assumes
        a level with the more southerly extremity, and I think I may say an elevation
        higher than at the south a short distance, say half or three fourths of
        a mile. As you pass toward Canandaigua it lessens gradually until the surface
        assumes its common level, or is broken by other smaller hills or ridges,
        water courses and ravines. I think I am justified in saying that this is
        the highest hill for some
        distance round, and I am certain that its appearance, as it rises so suddenly
        from a plain on the north, must attract the notice of the travelers as
        he passes by.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        At about one mile west rises another ridge of less height, running parallel
        with the former, leaving a beautiful vale between. The soil is of the first
        quality for the country, and under a state of cultivation, which gives
        a prospect at once imposing, when one reflects on the
        fact, that here, between these hills, the entire power and national strength
        of both the Jaredites and Nephites were destroyed.

        and 530</span><superscript><span>th</span></superscript><span>
        pages of the Book of Mormon
        you will read Mormon’s account of the last great struggle of his people,
        as they were encamped round this hill Cumorah. (it is printed Camorah,
        which is an error.) In this valley fell the
        remaining strength and pride of a once powerful people, the Nephites—once
        so highly
        favored of the Lord, but at that time in darkness, doomed to suffer extermination
        by the hand of their barbarous and uncivilized brethren. From the top of
        this hill, Mormon, with a few others, after the battle, gazed with horror
        upon the mangled remains of those who, the day before, were filled with
        anxiety, hope or doubt. A few had fled to the south, who were hunted down
        by the victorious party, and all who would not deny the Savior and his
        religion, were put to death. Mormon himself, according to the record of
        his son Moroni, was also slain.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        But a long time previous to this disaster it appears from his own account,
        he foresaw approaching destruction. In fact, if he perused the records
        of his fathers, [p. 86] which
        were in his possession, he could have learned that such would be the case.
        Alma, who lived before the coming of the Messiah, prophesies this. He,
        however, by divine appointment, abridged from those records, in his own
        style and language, a short account of the more important and prominent
        items, from the days of Lehi to his own time, after which he
        deposited, as he says, on the 529</span><superscript><span>th</span></superscript><span>
        page, all the records in this same hill, Cumorah and after gave his small
        record to his son Moroni, who, as appears from the same, finished, after
        witnessing the extinction of his people as a nation.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        It was not the wicked who overcame the righteous; far from this: it was
        the wicked against the wicked, and by the wicked the wicked were punished.
        The Nephites who
        were once enlightened, had fallen from a more elevated standing as to
        favor and privilege before the Lord in consequence of the righteousness
        of their fathers, and now falling below, for such was actually the case,
        were suffered to be overcome, and the land was left to the possession of
        the red men, who were without intelligence, only in the affairs of their
        wars; and having no records, only preserving their history by tradition
        from father to son, lost the account of their true origin, and wandered
        from river to river, from hill to hill,
        from mountain to mountain, and from sea to sea, till the land was again
        peopled, in a measure, by a rude, wild, revengeful, warlike and barbarous
        race. Such are our Indians.

        This hill, by the Jaredites, was called Ramah: by it, or around it pitched
        the famous army of Coriantumr their tents. Coriantumr was the last king
        of the Jaredites The opposing
        army were to the west, and in this same valley, and nearby, from day to
        day, did that mighty race spill their blood, in wrath, contending, as it
        were, brother against brother, and father, against son. In this same spot,
        in full view from the top of this same hill, one may gaze with astonishment
        upon the ground which was twice covered with the dead and
        dying of our fellow men. Here may be seen where once sunk to naught the
        pride and
        strength of two mighty nations; and here may be contemplated, in solitude,
        while nothing but the faithful record of Mormon and Moroni is now extant
        to inform us of the fact,
        scenes of misery and distress—the aged, whose silver locks in other places
        and at other times would command reverence; the mother, who in other circumstances
        would be spared from violence; the infant, whose tender cries would be
        regarded and listened to with a feeling of compassion and tenderness; and
        the virgin, whose grace, beauty and modesty, would be esteemed and held
        inviolate by all good men and enlightened and
        civilized nations, alike disregarded and treated with scorn!—in vain did
        the hoary head and man of gray hairs ask for mercy; in vain did the mother
        plead for compassion; in vain did the helpless and harmless infant weep
        for verry anguish, and in vain did the virgin seek to
        escape the ruthless hand of revengeful foes and demons in human form—all
        alike were trampled down by the feet of the strong, and crushed beneath
        the rage of battle and war!
        Alas, who can reflect upon the last struggles of great and populous nations,
        sinking to dust beneath the hand of Justice and retribution without weeping
        over the corruptions of the human heart, and sighing for the hour when
        the clangor of arms shall no more be heard, nor the calamities of contending
        armies no more experienced for a thousand years? Alas, the calamity of
        war, the extinction of nations, the ruin of kingdoms, the fall of empires
        and the dissolution of governments! O the misery, distress and evil attendant
        on these!
        Who can contemplate like scenes without sorrowing, and who so destitute
        of
        commiseration as not to be pained that man has fallen so low, so far beneath
        the station in which he was created?
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        In this vale lie commingled, in one mass of ruin the ashes of thousands,
        and in this vale was destined to consume the fair forms and vigorous systems
        of tens of thousands of the human race—blood mixed with blood, flesh with
        flesh, bones with bones and dust with dust! When the vital spark which
        animated their clay had fled, each lifeless lump lay on one common level—cold
        and inanimate. Those bosoms which had burned with rage
        against each other for real or supposed injury, had now ceased to heave
        with malice; those arms which were, a few moments before nerved with strength,
        had alike become
        paralyzed and those hearts which had been fired with revenge, had now
        ceased to beat, and the head to think—in silence, in solitude, and in disgrace
        alike, they have long since turned to earth, to their mother dust, to await
        the august, and to millions, awful hour, when the trump of the Son of God
        shall echo and reecho from the skies, and they come
        forth, quickened and immortalized, to not only stand in each other’s presence,
        but before the bar of him who is Eternal!

        October 1835 – Letter VIII
    </span></heading>

    <block><span>
        The hill of which I have been speaking, at the time mentioned, presented
        a varied appearance: the north end rose suddenly from the plain, forming
        a promontory without timber, but covered with grass. As you passed to the
        south you soon came to scattering
        timber, the surface having been cleared by art or by wind; and a short
        distance further left, you are surrounded with the common forest of the
        country. It is necessary to observe, that even the part cleared was only
        occupied for pasturage, its steep ascent and narrow summit not admitting
        the plow of the husbandman, with any degree of ease or profit. It was at
        the second mentioned place where the record was found to be deposited,
        on the west side of the hill, not far from the top down its side; and when
        myself visited the place in the year 1830, there were several trees standing:
        enough to cause a shade in summer, but not so
        much as to prevent the surface being covered with grass—which was also
        the case when the record was first found.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Whatever may be the feeling of men on the reflection of past acts which
        have been performed on certain portions or spots of this earth, I know
        not, neither does it add or
        diminish to nor from the reality of my subject. When Moses heard the voice
        of God, at the foot of Horeb, out of the burning bush, he was commanded
        to take his shoes off his
        feet, for the ground on which he stood was holy. The same may be observed
        when Joshua beheld the “Captain of the Lord’s host” by Jericho. And I confess
        that my mind was filled with many reflections; and though I did not then
        loose my shoe, yet with gratitude to God did I offer up the sacrifice of
        my heart.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        How far below the surface these records were placed by Moroni, I am unable
        to say; but from the fact they had been some fourteen hundred years buried,
        and that too on the side
        of a hill so steep, one is ready to conclude that they were some feet
        below, as the earth would naturally wear more or less in that length of
        time. But they being placed toward the top of the hill, the ground would
        not remove as much as at two-thirds, perhaps.
        Another circumstance would prevent a wearing of the earth: in all probability,
        as soon as timber had time to grow, the hill was covered, after the Nephites
        were destroyed, and the roots of the same would hold the surface. However,
        on this point I shall leave every man to draw his own conclusion, and form
        his own speculation, as I only promised to give a
        description of the place at the time the records were found in 1823. It
        is sufficient for my present purpose, to know, that such is the fact: that
        in 1823, yes, 1823, a man with whom I have had the most intimate and personal
        acquaintance, for almost seven years, actually
        discovered by the vision of God, the plates from which the
        Book of Mormon,
        as much as it is disbelieved, was translated! Such is the case, though
        men rack their verry brains to invent falsehood, and then waft them upon
        every breeze, to the contrary notwithstanding.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        I have now given sufficient on the subject of the hill Cumorah—it has
        a singular and imposing appearance for that country, and must excite the
        curious enquiry of every lover of the Book of Mormon:
        though I hope never like Jerusalem and the sepulcher of our Lord, the
        pilgrims. In my estimation, certain places are dearer to me for what they
        now contain than for what they have contained. For the satisfaction of
        such as believe I have been thus particular, and to avoid the question
        being a thousand times asked, more than any other cause, shall proceed
        and be as particular as heretofore. The manner in which the plates were
        deposited:
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        First, a hole of sufficient depth, (how deep I know not) was dug. At the
        bottom of this
        was laid a stone of suitable size, the upper surface being smooth. At
        each edge was placed a large quantity of cement, and into this cement,
        at the four edges of this stone, were placed, erect, four others, their
        bottom edges resting in the cement at the outer edges of the first stone.
        The four last named, when placed erect, formed a box, the corners, or where
        the edges of the four came in contact, were also cemented so firmly that
        the moisture from
        without was prevented from entering. It is to be observed, also, that
        the inner surface of the four erect, or side stones was smooth. This box
        was sufficiently large to admit a breast- plate, such as was used by the
        ancients to defend the chest, &amp;c. from the arrows and
        weapons of their enemy. From the bottom of the box, or from the breast-plate,
        arose three small pillars composed of the same description of cement used
        on the edges; and upon these three pillars was placed the record of the
        children of Joseph, and of a people who left the tower far, far before
        the days of Joseph, or a sketch of each, which had it not been for this,
        and the never failing goodness of God, we might have perished in our sins,
        having been left to bow down before the altars of the Gentiles and to have
        paid homage to the
        priests of Baal! I must not forget to say that this box, containing the
        record was covered with another stone, the bottom surface being flat and
        the upper, crowning. But those three pillars were not so lengthy as to
        cause the plates and the crowning stone to come in
        contact. I have now given you, according to my promise, the manner in
        which this record was deposited; though when it was first visited by our
        brother, in 1823, a part of the
        crowning stone was visible above the surface while the edges were concealed
        by the soil and grass, from which circumstances you will see, that however
        deep this box might have been placed by Moroni at first, the time had been
        sufficient to wear the earth so that it was easily discovered when once
        directed, and yet not enough to make a perceivable difference to the passer-by.
        So wonderful are the works of the Almighty, and so far from our finding
        out are his ways, that one who trembles to take his holy name into his
        lips, is left to
        wonder at his exact providences, and the fulfilment of his purposes in
        the event of times and seasons.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        A few years sooner might have found even the top stone concealed, and
        discouraged our brother from attempting to make a further trial to obtain
        this rich treasure, for fear of
        discovery; and a few latter might have left the small box uncovered, and
        exposed its valuable contents to the rude calculations and vain speculations
        of those who neither understand common language nor fear God.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        But such would have been contrary to the words of the ancients and the
        promises made to them: and this is why I am left to admire the works and
        see the wisdom in the designs of the Lord in all things manifested to the
        eyes of the world: they show that all human
        inventions are like the vapors, while his word endures forever and his
        promises to the last generation.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Having thus digressed from my main subject to give a few items for the
        special benefit of all, it will be necessary to return, and proceed as
        formerly.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        And if any suppose I have indulged too freely in reflections, I will only
        say that it is my opinion, were one to have a view of the glory of God
        which is to cover Israel in the last days, and know that these, though
        they may be thought small things, were the beginning to effect the same,
        they would be at a loss where to close, should they give a moment’s
        vent to the imaginations of the heart
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        You will have wondered, perhaps, that the mind of our brother should be
        occupied with the thoughts of the goods of this world, at the time of arriving
        at Cumorah, on the
        morning of the 22</span><superscript><span>nd</span></superscript><span>
        of September, 1823, after having been rapt in the visions of heaven during
        the night, and also seeing and hearing in open day; but the mind of man
        is easily turned, if it is not held by the power of God through the prayer
        of faith, and you will
        remember that I have said that two invisible powers were operating upon
        his mind during his walk from his residence to Cumorah, and that the one
        urging the certainty of wealth and ease in this life, had so powerfully
        wrought upon him, that the great object so
        carefully and impressively named by the angel had entirely gone from his
        recollection that only a fixed determination to obtain now urged him forward.
        In this, which occasioned a failure to obtain, at that time, the record,
        do not understand me to attach blame to our brother: he was young, and
        his mind easily turned from correct principles, unless he could be favored
        with a certain round of experience. And yet, while young, untraditionated
        and untaught in the systems of the world, he was in a situation to be lead
        into the great work of God, and be qualified to perform it in due time.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        After arriving at the repository, a little exertion in removing the soil
        from the edges of the top of the box, and a light pry, brought to his natural
        vision its contents. No sooner did he behold this sacred treasure than
        his hopes were renewed, and he supposed his success
        certain; and without first attempting to take it from its long place of
        deposit, he thought, perhaps, there might be something more, equally as
        valuable, and to take only the plates, might give others an opportunity
        of obtaining the remainder, which could he secure, would still add to his
        store of wealth. These, in short, were his reflections, without once thinking
        of the solemn instruction of the heavenly messenger, that all must be done
        with an express view of glorifying God.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        On attempting to take possession of the records a shock was produced upon
        his system, by an invisible power, which deprived him in a measure, of
        his natural strength. He desisted for an instant, and then made another
        attempt, but was more sensibly shocked than before. What was the occasion
        of this he knew not—there was the pure unsullied record, as had been described—he
        had heard of the power, of enchantment, and a thousand like stories, which
        held the hidden treasures of the earth, and supposed that physical exertion
        and personal strength was only necessary to enable him to yet obtain the
        object of his wish. He
        therefore made the third attempt with an increased exertion, when his
        strength failed him more than at either of the former times, and without
        premeditation he exclaimed, “Why can I not obtain this book?” “Because
        you have not kept the commandments of the
        Lord,” answered a voice, within a seeming short distance. He looked, and
        to his astonishment, there stood the angel who had previously given him
        the directions concerning this matter. In an instant, all the former instructions,
        the great intelligence concerning Israel and the last days, were brought
        to his mind: he thought of the time
        when his heart was fervently engaged in prayer to the Lord, when his spirit
        was contrite, and when his holy messenger, from the skies unfolded the
        wonderful things connected with this record. He had come, to be sure, and
        found the word of the angel fulfilled
        concerning the reality of the record but he had failed to remember the
        great end for which they had been kept, and in consequence could not have
        power to take them into his possession and bear them away.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        At that instant he looked to the Lord in prayer, and as he prayed darkness
        began to
        disperse from his mind and his soul was lit up as it was the evening before,
        and he was
        filled with the Holy Spirit; and again did the Lord manifest his condescension
        and mercy: the heavens were opened and the glory of the Lord shone round
        about and rested upon him. While he thus stood gazing and admiring, the
        angel said, “Look!” and as he thus spake he beheld the prince of darkness,
        surrounded by his innumerable train of associates.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        All this passed before him, and the heavenly messenger said:
        </span><quote>
            <block><span>
                All this is shown, the good and the evil, the holy and impure, the glory
                of God and the power of darkness, that you may know hereafter the two powers
                and never be influenced or overcome by that wicked one.
                </span><note><span>Moroni 7:13–14</span></note><span>Behold, whatever
                entices and leads to good and to do good, is of God, and whatever does
                not is of that wicked one. It is he
                that fills the hearts of men with evil, to walk in darkness and blaspheme
                God; and you may learn from henceforth, that his ways are to destruction,
                but the way of holiness is peace and rest.
            </span></block>

            <block><span>
                You now see why you could not obtain this record; that the commandment
                was strict, and that if ever these sacred things are obtained they must
                be by prayer and
                faithfulness in obeying the Lord. They are not deposited here for the
                sake of
                accumulating gain and wealth for the glory of this world: they were sealed
                by the prayer of faith, and because of the knowledge which they contain
                they are of no worth among the children of men, only for their knowledge.
                On them is contained
                the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ, as it was given to his people
                on this land, and when it shall be brought forth by the power of God it
                shall be carried to the Gentiles, of whom many will receive it, and after
                will the seed of Israel be brought into the fold of their Redeemer by obeying
                it also. Those who kept the commandments of the Lord on this land, desired
                this at his hand, and through the prayer of faith obtained the promise,
                that if their descendants should transgress and fall away, that a record
                might be kept and in the last days come to their children. These things
                are sacred, and must be kept so, for the promise of the Lord concerning
                them must be fulfilled. No man
                can obtain them if his heart is impure, because they contain that which
                is sacred; and besides, should they be entrusted in unholy hands the knowledge
                could not come to the world, because they cannot be interpreted by the
                learning of this generation; consequently, they would be considered of
                no worth, only as precious metal.

                Therefore, remember, that they are to be translated by the gift and power
                of God. By them will the Lord work a great and a marvelous work: the wisdom
                of the wise shall become as naught, and the understanding of the prudent</span><note><span>Isaiah 29:14</span></note><span>
                shall be hid, and because the power of God shall be displayed those who
                profess to know the truth but walk in
                deceit, shall tremble with anger; but with signs and with wonders, with
                gifts and with healings, with the manifestations of the power of God, and
                with the Holy Ghost, shall the hearts of the faithful be comforted.

                You have now beheld the power of God manifested and the power of Satan:
                you see that there is nothing that is desirable in the works of darkness;
                that they cannot bring happiness; that those who are overcome therewith
                are miserable, while on the other hand the righteous are blessed with a
                place in the kingdom of God where joy
                unspeakable surrounds them. There they rest beyond the power of the enemy
                of truth, where no evil can disturb them. The glory of God crowns them,
                and they continually feast upon his goodness and enjoy his smiles.

                Behold, notwithstanding you have seen this great display of power, by
                which you may ever be able to detect the evil one, yet I give unto you
                another sign, and when it comes to pass then know that the Lord is God
                and that he will fulfil his purposes, and that the knowledge which this
                record contains will go to every nation, and kindred and tongue, and people
                under the whole heaven. This is the sign: When these things begin to be
                known, that is, when it is known that the Lord has shown you these things,
                the workers of iniquity will seek your overthrow: they will circulate
                falsehoods to destroy your reputation, and also will seek to take your
                life; but remember this, if you are faithful, and shall hereafter continue
                to keep the
                commandments of the Lord, you shall be preserved to bring these things
                forth; for in due time he will again give you a commandment to come and
                take them. When they are interpreted the Lord will give the holy priesthood
                to some, and they shall begin to proclaim this gospel and baptize by water,
                and after that they shall have power to give the Holy Ghost by the laying
                on of their hands. Then will persecution rage more and more; for the iniquities
                of men shall be revealed, and those who are not built upon the Rock will
                seek to overthrow this church; but it will increase the more opposed, and
                spread farther and farther, increasing in knowledge till they shall be
                sanctified and
                receive an inheritance where the glory of God will rest upon them; and
                when this takes place, and all things are prepared, the ten tribes of Israel
                will be revealed in the north country, whither they have been for a long
                season; and when this is fulfilled will be brought to pass that saying
                of the prophets:

                But, notwithstanding the workers of iniquity shall seek your destruction
                the arm of the Lord will be extended, and you will be borne off conqueror
                if you keep all his commandments. Your name shall be known among the nations,
                for the work which the Lord will perform by your hands shall cause the
                righteous to rejoice and the
                wicked to rage: with the one it shall be had in honor, and with the other
                in reproach; yet, with these it shall be a terror because of the great
                and marvelous work which shall follow the coming forth of this fulness
                of the gospel. Now, go thy way, remembering what the Lord has done for
                thee, and be diligent in keeping his commandments, and he will deliver
                thee from temptations and all the arts and devises of the wicked one.
                Forget not to pray, that thy mind may become strong, that when he shall
                manifest unto thee, thou mayest have power to escape the evil, and obtain
                these precious things.

        Though I am unable to paint before the mind, a perfect description of
        the scenery which passed before our brother, I think I have said enough
        to give you a field for reflection
        which may not be unprofitable. You see the great wisdom in God in leading
        him thus far, that his mind might begin to be more matured, and thereby
        be able to judge correctly, the
        spirits. I do not say that he would not have obtained the record had he
        went according to the direction of the angel—I say that he would; but God
        knowing all things from the beginning, began thus to instruct his servant.
        And in this it is plainly to be seen that the adversary of truth is not
        sufficient to overthrow the work of God. You will remember
        that I said, two invisible powers were operating upon the mind of our
        brother while going to Cumorah. In this, then, I discover wisdom in the
        dealings of the Lord: it was impossible for any man to translate the
        Book of Mormon
        by the gift of God, and endure the
        afflictions, and temptations, and devices of Satan, without being overthrown
        unless he had been previously benefited with a certain round of experience:
        and had our brother obtained the record the first time, not knowing how
        to detect the works of darkness, he might have been deprived of the blessings
        of sending forth the word of truth to this
        generation. Therefore, God knowing that Satan would thus lead his mind
        astray, began at that early hour, that when the full time should arrive,
        he might have a servant prepared to fulfill his purpose. So, however afflicting
        to his feelings this repulse might have been, he had reason to rejoice
        before the Lord and be thankful for the favors and mercies shown; that
        whatever other instruction was necessary to the accomplishing this great
        work, he had learned, by experience, how to discern between the spirit
        of Christ and the spirit of the
        devil.
