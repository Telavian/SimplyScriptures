     Warning against false teachers
    </span></heading>

    <block>
     <verse>3</verse><span>As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went
     into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they
     teach no other doctrine,
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which
     minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in
     faith; so do.
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure
     heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned;
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>from which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain
     jangling;
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither
     what they say, nor whereof they affirm.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>8</verse><span>But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully;
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man,
     but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for
     sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers
     and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>for whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with
     mankind, for men- stealers, for liars, for perjured persons,
     and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound
     doctrine:
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which
     was committed to my trust.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>12</verse><span>And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for
     that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>who was before a blasphemer, and persecutor, and injurious;
     but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in
     unbelief.
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith
     and love which is in Christ Jesus.
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation,
     that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of
     whom I am chief.
     </span><verse>16</verse><span>Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first
     Jesus Christ might show forth all long-suffering, for a
     pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to
     life everlasting.
     </span><verse>17</verse><span>Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only
     wise God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>18</verse><span>This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to
     the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them
     mightest war a good warfare;
     </span><verse>19</verse><span>holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put
     away, concerning faith have made shipwreck;
     </span><verse>20</verse><span>of whom is Hymeneus and Alexander; whom I have delivered
     unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.
    </span></block>

    <chapter>2
    </chapter>

    <block>
     <verse>1</verse><span>I exhort therefore, that, first of
     all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving thanks,
     be made for all men;
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>for kings, and
     for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and
     peaceful life in all godliness and honesty.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>For this is good and acceptable in
     the sight of God our Savior;
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>who is
     willing to have all men to be saved, and to come unto the
     knowledge of the truth
     </span><dunder><span>which is in Christ Jesus, who is the Only Begotten Son of
     God and ordained to be a Mediator between God and man; who is
     one God, and hath power over all men</span></dunder><span>.
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>For there is
     one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ
     Jesus;
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>who gave himself a ransom for
     all, to be testified in due time.
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>Whereunto I am ordained a preacher,
     and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not,) a
     teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>8</verse><span>I will therefore that men pray everywhere, lifting up holy
     hands, without wrath and doubting.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>9</verse><span>In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest
     apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with braided
     hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>but (which becometh women professing godliness) with good
     works.
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>Let the women learn in silence with all subjection.
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>For I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority
     over the man, but to be in silence.
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>For Adam was first formed, then Eve.
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was
     in the transgression.
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>Notwithstanding they shall be saved in childbearing, if
     they continue in faith and charity and holiness with
     sobriety.

     Qualifications of a bishop
    </span></heading>

    <chapter>3
    </chapter>

    <block>
     <verse>1</verse><span>This is a true saying, if a man desire the office of a
     bishop, he desireth a good work.
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife,
     vigilant, sober, of good behavior, given to hospitality, apt
     to teach;
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>not given to wine, no striker, not
     greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not
     covetous;
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>one that ruleth well his
     own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>(for if a man know not how to rule
     his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>Not a novice, lest being lifted up
     with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil.
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>Moreover he must have a good report
     of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the
     snare of the devil.
    </span></block>

    <heading><span>
     Qualifications of a deacon
    </span></heading>

    <block>
     <verse>8</verse><span>Likewise the deacons must be grave, not double-tongued, not
     given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>And let these also first be proved; then let them use the
     office of a deacon, being found blameless.
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober,
     faithful in all things.
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their
     children and their own houses well.
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>For they that have used the office of deacon well purchase
     to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith
     which is in Christ Jesus.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>14</verse><span>These things I write unto thee, hoping to come unto thee
     shortly;
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>but if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou
     oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the
     church of the living God.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>16</verse><span>The pillar and ground of the truth is, (and without
     controversy, great is the mystery of godliness,) God was
     manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of
     angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the
     world, received up into glory.

     Warnings against false teachers
    </span></heading>

    <chapter>4
    </chapter>

    <block>
     <verse>1</verse><span>Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times
     some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing
     spirits, and the doctrines of devils;
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared
     as with a hot iron;
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats,
     which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of
     them which believe and know the truth.
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be
     refused, if it be received with thanksgiving;
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>6</verse><span>It thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things,
     thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up
     in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou
     hast attained.
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>But refuse profane and old wives’ fables, and excercise
     thyself rather unto godliness.
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>For bodily excercise profiteth little; but godliness is
     profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that
     now is, and of that which is to come.
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation.
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>For therefore we both labor and suffer reproach,
     because we trust in the living God, who is the Savior of
     all men, specially of those that believe.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>11</verse><span>These things command and teach:
     </span><dot>
      <verse>12</verse><span>Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the
      believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in
      faith, in purity.</span></dot>
     <dot>
      <verse>13</verse><span>Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to
      doctrine.
     </span></dot>
     <dot>
      <verse>14</verse><span>Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by
      prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.
     </span></dot>
     <dot>
      <verse>15</verse><span>Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy
      profiting may appear to all.
     </span></dot>
     <dot>
      <verse>16</verse><span>Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them;
      for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear
      thee.

     Widows
    </span></heading>

    <block>
     <verse>3</verse><span>Honor widows that are widows indeed.
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to show
     piety at home, and to requite their parents; for that is good and
     acceptable before God.
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and
     continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless.
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own
     house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>9</verse><span>Let not a widow be taken into the number under
     threescore years old, having been the wife of one man,
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>well reported of for good works; if she have
     brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the
     saints’
     </span><under>
      <note><span>feet</span></note><span>clothes</span></under><span>, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have
      diligently followed every good work.
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>But the
     younger widows refuse; for when they have begun to wax wanton against
     Christ, they will marry;
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>having damnation,
     because they have cast off their first faith.
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>And withal they learn to be idle, wandering
     about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and
     busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>I will therefore that the younger women marry,
     bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to
     speak reproachfully.
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>For some are already
     turned aside after Satan.
     </span><verse>16</verse><span>If any man or woman
     that believeth have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church
     be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.

     Elders
    </span></heading>

    <block>
     <verse>17</verse><span>Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor,
     especially they who labor in the word and doctrine.
     </span><verse>18</verse><span>For the scripture saith, “Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth
     out the corn.” And, the laborer is worthy of his reward.
     </span><verse>19</verse><span>Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three
     witnesses.
     </span><verse>20</verse><span>Them that sin rebuke before all, that others may also fear.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>21</verse><span>I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect
     angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before
     another, doing nothing by partiality.
     </span><verse>22</verse><span>Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men’s sins;
     keep thyself pure.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>(24)</verse><span>Some men’s sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some
     men they follow after.
     </span><verse>(25)</verse><span>Likewise the good works of some are manifest beforehand; and they that
     are otherwise cannot be hid.

    <block>
     <verse>1</verse><span>Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters
     worthy of all honor, that the name of God and his doctrine be not
     blasphemed.
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them,
     because they are brethren; but rather do them service, because they are
     faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and
     exhort.

     Withdraw from false teachers
    </span></heading>

    <block>
     <verse>3</verse><span>If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even
     the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is
     according to godliness;
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>he is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of
     words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the
     truth, supposing that gain is godliness; from such withdraw
     thyself.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>6</verse><span>But godliness with contentment is great gain.
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry
     nothing out.
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>And having food and raiment, let us be therewith content.
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into
     many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and
     perdition.
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>For the love of money is the root of all evil; which while some coveted
     after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through
     with many sorrows.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>11</verse><span>But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and
     follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on
     eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good
     profession before many witnesses.
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>I give thee
     charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all things, and before Christ
     Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession;
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>that thou keep this commandment without spot,
     unrebukable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ;
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>which in his times he shall show, who is the
     blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords,
     </span><dunder><span>to whom be honor and power everlasting</span></dunder><span>;
     </span><verse>16</verse><span>whom no man hath seen, nor can see, unto whom
     no man can approach, only he who hath the light and the hope of
     immortality dwelling in him.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>17</verse><span>Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high-minded,
     nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us
     richly all things to enjoy;
     </span><verse>18</verse><span>that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to
     distribute, willing to communicate;
