     <verse>1</verse><span>The elder unto the well beloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.

     <verse>2</verse><span>Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in
     health, even as thy soul prospereth.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the
     truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in
     truth.

     <verse>5</verse><span>Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren,
     and to strangers;
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>which have borne witness of thy charity before the church; whom if thou
     bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well;
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>because that for his nameâ€™s sake they went forth, taking nothing of the
     Gentiles.
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellow helpers to
     the truth.

     <verse>9</verse><span>I wrote unto the church; but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the
     preeminence among them, receiveth us not.
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating
     against us with malicious words; and not content therewith, neither doth
     he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and
     casteth them out of the church.

     <verse>11</verse><span>Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that
     doeth good is of God; but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>Demetrius hath good report of all men, and of the truth itself; yea,
     and we also bare record; and ye know that our record is true.

     <verse>13</verse><span>I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto
     thee;
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>but I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face.
     Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Greet the friends by
     name.
