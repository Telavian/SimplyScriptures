    <note><span>Forasmuch as</span></note><span>As I am a messenger of Jesus Christ, and knowing that</span></under><span>
   many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those
   things which are most surely believed among us;
   </span><verse>2</verse><span>even as they delivered them unto us, who from the beginning were
   eyewitnesses and ministers of the word;
   </span><verse>3</verse><span>it seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all
   things from the very first, to write unto thee, in order, most excellent
   Theophilus,
   </span><verse>4</verse><span>that thou mightest know the certainty of those things wherein thou hast

   The birth of John the Baptist foretold

  <block>
   <verse>5</verse><span>There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest
   named Zacharias, of the course of Abia; and his wife being of the
   daughters of Aaron, and her name Elizabeth,
   </span><verse>6</verse><span>were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and
   ordinances of the Lord blameless;
   </span><verse>7</verse><span>and they had no child. Elizabeth was barren, and they were both well
   stricken in years.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>8</verse><span>And while he executed the priest’s office before
   God, in the order of his
   </span><under>
    <note><span>course</span></note><span>priesthood</span></under><span>,
   </span><verse>9</verse><span>According to the
   </span><under>
    <note><span>custom of the priest’s office</span></note><span>law</span></under><span>, (his lot was to
    burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord,)
   </span><verse>10</verse><span>the whole multitude of the people were praying
   without at the time of incense.
   </span><verse>11</verse><span>And there
   appeared unto him an angel of the Lord, standing on the right side of the
   altar of incense.
   </span><verse>12</verse><span>And when Zacharias saw the
   angel, he was troubled and fear fell upon him.
   </span><verse>13</verse><span>But the angel said unto him:
   </span><quote>
    <block><span>
     Fear not, Zacharias, for thy prayer is heard, and thy wife Elizabeth shall
     bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>Thou shalt have joy and gladness, and many
     shall rejoice at his birth;
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>for he shall be
     great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong
     drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother’s
     womb.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>16</verse><span>And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God;
     </span><verse>17</verse><span>and he shall go before the Lord in the spirit and power of Elias, to
     turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to
     the wisdom of the just, to make ready a people prepared for the
     Lord.</span></block>

   <verse>18</verse><span>And Zacharias said unto the angel, “Whereby shall I know this? For I am
   an old man, and my wife is well stricken in years.”
   </span><verse>19</verse><span>And the angel answering, said unto him:</span><quote><span>
    I am Gabriel, who stand in the presence of God, and am sent to speak unto
    thee, and to show thee these glad tidings.
    </span><verse>20</verse><span>And
    behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak until the day that these
    things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words which shall
    be fulfilled in their season.

  <block>
   <verse>21</verse><span>And the people waited for Zacharias, and marveled that he tarried so
   long in the temple.
   </span><verse>22</verse><span>And when he came out, he could not speak unto them; and they perceived
   that he had seen a vision in the temple; for he beckoned unto them, and
   remained speechless.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>23</verse><span>And as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he
   departed to his own house.
   </span><verse>24</verse><span>And after those days, his wife Elizabeth conceived, and hid herself
   five months, saying, “</span><verse>25</verse><span>Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me,
   to take away my reproach from among men.”

   </span><verse>27</verse><span>to a virgin, espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of
   David; and the virgin’s name was Mary.
   </span><verse>28</verse><span>And the angel came in unto her and said:</span><quote><span>
    Hail, thou
    </span><dunder><span>virgin</span></dunder><span>, who art highly favored

   <verse>29</verse><span>And when she saw the angel, she was troubled at his saying, and
   pondered in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.
   </span><verse>30</verse><span>And the angel said unto her:</span><quote><span>
    Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found favor with God.
    </span><verse>31</verse><span>And behold, thou shalt conceive, and bring
    forth a son, and shall call his name Jesus.
    </span><verse>32</verse><span>He
    shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord
    God shall give unto him the throne of his father David;

    forever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.

   <verse>35</verse><span>And the angel answered and said unto her:

    <under>
     <note><span>The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee</span></note><span>Of the Holy Ghost, and the power of the Highest</span></under><span>. Therefore also,
     that holy child that shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.
    </span><verse>36</verse><span>And behold, thy cousin Elizabeth, she hath also
    conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her who
    is called barren.
    </span><verse>37</verse><span>For with God nothing can be

    that the mother of my Lord should come to me?

      <verse>5</verse><span>A sower went out to sow his seed; and as he sowed, some fell by the
      wayside; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it.
      </span><verse>6</verse><span>And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered
      away, because it lacked moisture.
      </span><verse>7</verse><span>And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and
      choked it.
      </span><verse>8</verse><span>And others fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an
      hundredfold.</span></quote>

       Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God; but to
       others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might
       not understand.

       <verse>11</verse><span>Now the parable is this: the seed is the word of God.

       and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe
       and be saved.
       </span><verse>13</verse><span>That which fell on the rock are they, who, when they hear, receive the
       word with joy; and they have no root, but for a while believe, and in a
       time of temptation fall away.
       </span><verse>14</verse><span>And that which fell among the thorns are they, who, when they have
       heard, go forth and are choked with cares, and riches, and pleasures of
       life, and bring no fruit to perfection.
       </span><verse>15</verse><span>But that which fell on the good ground are they, who receive the word

       falleth to me.” And he divided unto them his living.
       </span><verse>13</verse><span>And not many days after, the younger son
       gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there
       wasted his substance with riotous living.</span></block>

      <block>
       <verse>14</verse><span>And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land and

       sent him into his fields to feed swine.

       did eat; and no man gave unto him.

       unto him, that he had wasted his goods.
       </span><verse>2</verse><span>And he
       called him, and said unto him, “How is it that I hear this of thee? Give

      <block>
       <verse>3</verse><span>Then the steward said within himself, “What shall I do? For my lord
       taketh away from me the stewardship. I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed.

       they may receive me into their houses.”</span></block>

       <verse>5</verse><span>So he called every one of his lord’s debtors, and said unto the first,
       “How much owest thou unto my lord?”
