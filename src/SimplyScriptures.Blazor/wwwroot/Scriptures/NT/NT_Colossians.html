    <block>
     <verse>1</verse><span>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God, and Timotheus
     our brother,
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>to the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse;
     grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus
     Christ.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>3</verse><span>We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
     praying always for you,
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of your love to
     all the saints,
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>for the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard
     before in the word of the truth of the gospel;
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>which is come unto you, as in all generations of the world; and
     bringeth forth fruit, as it doth also in you, since the day ye heard
     of it, and knew the grace of God in truth;
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>as ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellow servant, who is for
     you a faithful minister of Christ;
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>9</verse><span>For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to
     pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the
     knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>that ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being
     fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto
     all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness;
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be
     partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light;
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath
     translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son;
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>in whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness
     of sins;
    </span></block>

    <heading><span>
     The Son of God
    </span></heading>

    <block>
     <verse>15</verse><span>Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every
     creature.
     </span><verse>16</verse><span>For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that
     are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or
     dominions, or principalities, or powers; all things were created by
     him, and for him;
     </span><verse>17</verse><span>and he is before all things, and by him all things consist.
     </span><verse>18</verse><span>And he is the head of the body, the church; who is the beginning,
     the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the
     preeminence.
     </span><verse>19</verse><span>For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell;
     </span><verse>20</verse><span>and, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to
     reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be
     things in earth, or things in heaven.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>21</verse><span>And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by
     wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled,
     </span><verse>22</verse><span>in the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and
     unblamable and unreprovable in his sight;
     </span><verse>23</verse><span>if ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved
     away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, and which was
     preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am
     made a minister;
     </span><verse>24</verse><span>who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is
     behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body’s sake,
     which is the church;
     </span><verse>25</verse><span>whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God
     which is given to me for you, to fulfill the word of God;
     </span><verse>26</verse><span>even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from
     generations, but now is made manifest to his saints;
     </span><verse>27</verse><span>to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of
     this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of
     glory;
     </span><verse>28</verse><span>whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all
     wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus;
     </span><verse>29</verse><span>whereunto I also labor, striving according to his working, which
     worketh in me mightily.
    </span></block>

    <chapter>2
    </chapter>

    <block>
     <verse>1</verse><span>For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and
     for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in
     the flesh;
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>that their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love,
     and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the
     acknowledgment of the mystery of God and of Christ, who is of God,
     even the Father;
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>4</verse><span>And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing
     words.
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the
     spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the steadfastness of
     your faith in Christ.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>6</verse><span>As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in
     him;
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>rooted and built up in him, and established in the faith, as ye
     have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>8</verse><span>Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit,
     after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and
     not after Christ.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>9</verse><span>For in him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality
     and power;
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>in whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without
     hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the
     circumcision of Christ;
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him
     through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from
     the dead.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>13</verse><span>And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your
     flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all
     trespasses;
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us,
     which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to
     his cross;
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>and having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of
     them openly, triumphing over them in it.
    </span></block>

    <heading><span>
     No judgment in food or drink
    </span></heading>

    <block>
     <verse>16</verse><span>Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect
     of a holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days;
     </span><verse>17</verse><span>which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.
     </span><verse>18</verse><span>Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and
     worshiping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not
     seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,
     </span><verse>19</verse><span>and not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and
     bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth
     with the increase of God.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>20</verse><span>Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the
     world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to
     ordinances,
     </span><verse>22</verse><span>which are after the doctrines and commandments of men, </span><verse>(21)</verse><span>who teach
     you to touch not, taste not, handle not; all those things which are
     to perish with the using?
     </span><verse>23</verse><span>Which things have indeed a show of wisdom in will worship, and
     humility, and neglecting the body as to the satisfying the flesh,
     not in any honor to God.
    </span></block>

    <heading><span>
     Seek things above
    </span></heading>

    <chapter>3
    </chapter>

    <block>
     <verse>1</verse><span>If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above,
     where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also
     appear with him in glory.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>5</verse><span>Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth;
     fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence,
     and covetousness, which is idolatry;
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>for which things’ sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of
     disobedience;
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>in the which ye also walked sometime, when ye lived in them.
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>But now ye also put off all these; anger,
     wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have
     put off the old man with his deeds;
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>and
     have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image
     of him that created him;
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>where there is
     neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian,
     Scythian, bond nor free; but Christ is all, and in all.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>12</verse><span>Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of
     mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering;
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have
     a quarrel against any; even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of
     perfectness.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>15</verse><span>And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye
     are called in one body; and be ye thankful.
     </span><verse>16</verse><span>Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching
     and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,
     singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.
     </span><verse>17</verse><span>And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the
     Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.

     <verse>19</verse><span>Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.
    </span></block>

    <block>

     discouraged.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>22</verse><span>Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh;
     not with eye-service, as men-pleasers; but in singleness of heart,
     fearing God;
     </span><verse>23</verse><span>and whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto
     men;
     </span><verse>24</verse><span>knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the
     inheritance; for ye serve the Lord Christ.
     </span><verse>25</verse><span>But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath
     done; and there is no respect of persons.

    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>2</verse><span>Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of
     utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in
     bonds;
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>that I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time.
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye
     may know how ye ought to answer every man.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>7</verse><span>All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, who is a beloved
     brother, and a faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord;
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>whom I sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know your
     state, and comfort your hearts;
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>with Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you.
     They shall make known unto you all things which are done here.
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>Aristarchus my fellow prisoner saluteth you, and Marcus, sister’s
     son to Barnabas, (touching whom ye received commandments; if he come
     unto you, receive him;)
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>and Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision.
     These only are my fellow workers in the kingdom of God, which have
     been a comfort unto me.
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you,
     always laboring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand
     perfect and complete in all the will of God.
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and them
     that are in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis.
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>Luke the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the
     church which is in his house.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>16</verse><span>And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also
     in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the
     epistle from Laodicea.
     </span><verse>17</verse><span>And say to Archippus, “Take heed to the ministry which thou hast
     received in the Lord, that thou fulfill it.”
    </span></block>
