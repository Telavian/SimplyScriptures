     <verse>1</verse><span>Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to
     the faith of God’s elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is
     after godliness;
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>in hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before
     the world began;
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>but hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is
     committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Savior;
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>to Titus, mine own son after the common faith; grace, mercy, and peace,
     from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.

     <verse>5</verse><span>For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order
     the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had
     appointed thee;
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>if any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children
     not accused of riot or unruly.

    <heading><span>Bishops
    </span></heading>

    <block>
     <verse>7</verse><span>For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not self-willed,
     not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy
     lucre;
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>but a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy,
     temperate;
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be
     able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the
     gainsayers.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>10</verse><span>For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially
     they of the circumcision;
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things
     which they ought not, for filthy lucre’s sake.
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said:</span><quote><span>
      The Cretians are always liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.
     </span></quote>

    <block>
     <verse>13</verse><span>This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be
     sound in the faith;
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn
     from the truth.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>15</verse><span>Unto the pure, let all things be pure; but unto them who are defiled
     and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but even their mind and conscience is
     defiled.
     </span><verse>16</verse><span>They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being
     abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.

     <verse>1</verse><span>But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine;
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>that the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in
     charity, in patience.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>The aged women, likewise, that they may be in behavior as becometh
     holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good
     things;
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>that they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their
     husbands, to love their children,
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>to be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own
     husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>6</verse><span>Young men likewise exhort to be sober-minded.
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>In all things showing thyself a pattern of good works; in doctrine
     showing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary
     part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>9</verse><span>Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please
     them well in all things; not answering again;
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>nor purloining, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the
     doctrine of God our Savior in all things.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>11</verse><span>For the grace of God which bringeth salvation to all men, hath
     appeared;
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live
     soberly, righteously, and
     godly, in this present world;
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>looking for that
     blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior
     Jesus Christ;
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>who gave himself for us, that he
     might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar
     people, zealous of good works.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>15</verse><span>These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no
     man despise thee.
    </span></block>

    <chapter>3
    </chapter>

    <block>
     <verse>1</verse><span>Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey
     magistrates, to be ready to every good work,
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>to speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, showing all
     meekness unto all men.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>3</verse><span>For we ourselves also were sometime foolish, disobedient, deceived,
     serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful,
     and hating one another.
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>But after that the kindness and love of God our Savior toward man
     appeared,
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his
     mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the
     Holy Ghost;
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior;
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>that being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to
     the hope of eternal life.
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm
     constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to
     maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto
     men.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>9</verse><span>But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and
     strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>A man that is a heretic, after the first and second admonition, reject;
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned
     of himself.

     <verse>12</verse><span>When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come
     unto me to Nicopolis; for I have determined there to winter.
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that
     nothing be wanting unto them.
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that
     they be not unfruitful.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>15</verse><span>All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith.
     Grace be with you all. Amen.
