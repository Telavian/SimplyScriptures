     <verse>1</verse><span>The Revelation of
     </span><under>
      <note><span>Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him</span></note><span>John, a servant of God, which was given unto him of Jesus Christ</span></under><span>,
      to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass, that he
      sent and signified by his angel unto his servant John,
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>who bore record of the word of God, and of the
     testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>Blessed are they who read, and they who hear
     </span><dunder><span>and understand</span></dunder><span>
     the words of this prophecy, and keep those things
     which are written therein, for the time
     </span><dunder><span>of the coming of the Lord</span></dunder><span>
     draweth nigh.

    <block>
     <verse>4</verse><dunder><span>Now this is the testimony of</span></dunder><span>
     John to the seven servants who are over the seven churches in Asia.
     Grace unto you, and peace from him who is, and who was, and who is to
     come;
     </span><under>
      <note><span>and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne</span></note><span>who hath sent forth his angel from before his throne, to testify unto
      those who are the seven servants over the seven
      churches.</span></under>

    <block>
     <verse>5</verse><under>
      <note><span>And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and</span></note><span>Therefore, I, John, the faithful witness, bear record of the things
      which were delivered me of the angel, and from Jesus Christ</span></under><span>
     the first begotten of the
     dead, and the Prince of the kings of the earth. And unto him who loved us,
     be glory; who washed us from our sins in his own blood,
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>and hath made us kings and priests unto God, his
     Father. To him be glory and dominion, forever and ever. Amen.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>7</verse><span>For behold, he cometh in the clouds
     </span><dunder><span>with ten thousands of his saints in the kingdom, clothed with the glory of his Father</span></dunder><span>.
     And every eye shall see him;
     and they who pierced him, and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because
     of him. Even so, Amen.
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>For he saith, “I am Alpha
     and Omega, the beginning and the ending, the Lord, who is, and who was,
     and who is to come, the Almighty.”
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>9</verse><span>I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in
     the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called
     Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day, and heard behind me a great
     voice, as of a trumpet,
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>saying:</span><quote><span>
      I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last;” and, “What thou seest,
      write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia;
      unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and
      unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.

     being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of
     Man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps
     with a golden girdle.
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his
     eyes were as a flame of fire;
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>and his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and
     his voice as the sound of many waters.
     </span><verse>16</verse><span>And he had in his right hand seven stars; and out of his mouth went a
     sharp two-edged sword; and his countenance was as the sun shining in his
     strength.
     </span><verse>17</verse><span>And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right
     hand upon me, saying unto me:

       that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and
       have the keys of hell and of death.

       which shall be hereafter.
