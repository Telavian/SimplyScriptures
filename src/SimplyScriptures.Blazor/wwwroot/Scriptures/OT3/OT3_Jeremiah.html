  <verse>1</verse><span>The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in
  Anathoth in the land of Benjamin;
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>to whom the word of the LORD came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon
  king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah,
  unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of
  Judah, unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth
  month.

  <verse>4</verse><span>Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:</span><quote>
   <verse>5</verse><span>Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest
   forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet
   unto the nations.</span></quote>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>Then said I, “Ah, Lord GOD! Behold, I cannot speak; for I am a child.”
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>But the LORD said unto me:</span><quote><span>
   Say not, ‘I am a child;’ for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee,
   and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak.
   </span><verse>8</verse><span>Be not afraid of their faces; for I am with thee
   to deliver thee, saith the LORD.

  <verse>9</verse><span>Then the LORD put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And the LORD
  said unto me:</span><quote><span>
   Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth.
   </span><verse>10</verse><span>See,
   I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root
   out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to
   plant.

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, “Jeremiah, what
  seest thou?” And I said, “I see a rod of an almond tree.”
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>Then said the LORD unto me, “Thou hast well seen; for I will hasten my
  word to perform it.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying, “What
  seest thou?” And I said, “I see a seething pot; and the face thereof is
  toward the north.”
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>Then the LORD said unto me:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>
    Out of the north an evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the
    land.
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>For, lo, I will call all the families of
    the kingdoms of the north, saith the LORD.
   </span></block>

   <block><span>
    And they shall come,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and they shall set everyone his throne at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem,</span></indent><span>
    and against all the walls thereof round about,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and against all the cities of Judah.</span></indent>
    <verse>16</verse><span>And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>who have forsaken me,</span></indent><span>
    and have burned incense unto other gods,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and worshipped the works of their own hands.</span></indent>
   </block>

   <block>
    <verse>17</verse><span>Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all
    that I command thee; be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound
    thee before them.
    </span><verse>18</verse><span>For, behold, I have made thee this day a defensed city, and an iron
    pillar, and brazen walls against the whole land, against the kings of
    Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and
    against the people of the land.
    </span><verse>19</verse><span>And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against
    thee; for I am with thee, saith the LORD, to deliver thee.</span></block>

 <block><span>
  Thus saith the LORD:</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>the love of thine espousals,</span></indent><span>
  when thou wentest after me in the wilderness,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>in a land that was not sown.</span></indent>
  <verse>3</verse><span>Israel was holiness unto the LORD,</span><break></break>

  <verse>4</verse><span>Hear ye the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob,</span><break></break>

  <verse>5</verse><span>Thus saith the LORD,</span><break></break><span>
  “What iniquity have your fathers found in me,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>that they are gone far from me,</span></indent><span>
  and have walked after vanity,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and are become vain?</span></indent>
  <verse>6</verse><span>Neither said they, ‘Where is the LORD</span><break></break>

  that led us through the wilderness,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>through a land of deserts and of pits,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>through a land of drought,</span></indent><span>

  <verse>7</verse><span>And I brought you into a plentiful country,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof;</span></indent><span>
  but when ye entered, ye defiled my land,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and made mine heritage an abomination.</span></indent>
  <verse>8</verse><span>The priests said not,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>‘Where is the LORD?’</span></indent><span>
  And they that handle the law knew me not;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the pastors also transgressed against me,</span></indent><span>
  and the prophets prophesied by Baal,</span><break></break>

  <indent><span>and send unto Kedar, and consider diligently,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and see if there be such a thing.</span></indent>
  <verse>11</verse><span>Hath a nation changed their gods,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>which are yet no gods?</span></indent><span>
  But my people have changed their glory</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>for that which doth not profit.</span></indent>

  <indent><span>thou art a swift dromedary traversing her ways;</span></indent>

  <verse>25</verse><span>Withhold thy foot from being unshod,</span><break></break>

  <verse>27</verse><span>saying to a stock, ‘Thou art my father;’</span><break></break>

  For they have turned their back unto me, and not their face;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>but in the time of their trouble they will say, ‘Arise, and save us.’</span></indent>
  <verse>28</verse><span>But where are thy gods that thou hast made thee?</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>Let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble;</span></indent>

  <verse>2</verse><span>Lift up thine eyes unto the high places,</span><break></break>

  In the ways hast thou sat for them,</span><break></break>

  <verse>6</verse><span>The LORD said also unto me in the days of Josiah the king:</span><quote><span>
   Hast thou seen that which backsliding Israel hath done? She is gone up
   upon every high mountain and under every green tree, and there hath played
   the harlot.
   </span><verse>7</verse><span>And I said after she had done all
   these things, ‘Turn thou unto me.’ But she returned not. And her
   treacherous sister Judah saw it.
   </span><verse>8</verse><span>And I saw, when
   for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery, I had
   put her away, and given her a bill of divorce; yet her treacherous sister
   Judah feared not, but went and played the harlot also.
   </span><verse>9</verse><span>And it came to pass through the lightness of her
   whoredom, that she defiled the land, and committed adultery with stones
   and with stocks.
   </span><verse>10</verse><span>And yet, for all this her
   treacherous sister Judah hath not turned unto me with her whole heart, but
   feignedly, saith the LORD.

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>And the LORD said unto me:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>
    The backsliding Israel hath justified herself more than treacherous Judah.
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>Go and proclaim these words toward the north,
    and say:
   </span></block>

   <block><span>
    Return, thou backsliding Israel, saith the LORD;</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and I will not cause mine anger to fall upon you;</span></indent><span>
    for I am merciful, saith the LORD,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and I will not keep anger forever.</span></indent>
    <verse>13</verse><span>Only acknowledge thine iniquity,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>that thou hast transgressed against the LORD thy God,</span></indent><span>
    and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and ye have not obeyed my voice, saith the LORD.</span></indent>
   </block>

   <block>
    <verse>14</verse><span>Turn, O backsliding children, saith the LORD, for I am married unto
    you; and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will
    bring you to Zion;
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>and I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed
    you with knowledge and understanding.
    </span><verse>16</verse><span>And it shall come to pass, when ye be multiplied and increased in the
    land, in those days, saith the LORD, they shall say no more, ‘The ark of
    the covenant of the LORD;’ neither shall it come to mind; neither shall
    they remember it; neither shall they visit it; neither shall that be
    done anymore.
    </span><verse>17</verse><span>At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the LORD, and all
    the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of the LORD, to
    Jerusalem; neither shall they walk anymore after the imagination of
    their evil heart.
    </span><verse>18</verse><span>In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the
    house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the
    north to the land that I have given for an inheritance unto your
    fathers.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>19</verse><span>But I said, “How shall I put thee among the children,</span><break></break>

    <indent><span>a goodly heritage of the hosts of nations?”</span></indent><span>
    And I said, “Thou shalt call me, ‘My father;’</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and shalt not turn away from me.</span></indent>
    <verse>20</verse><span>Surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband,</span><break></break>

   </span><verse>22</verse><span>For I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I
   brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or
   sacrifices;
   </span><verse>23</verse><span>but this thing commanded I them, saying, ‘Obey my voice, and I will be
   your God, and ye shall be my people; and walk ye in all the ways that I
   have commanded you, that it may be well unto you.’
   </span><verse>24</verse><span>But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in the
   counsels, and in the imagination of their evil heart, and went backward,
   and not forward.
   </span><verse>25</verse><span>Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt
   unto this day, I have even sent unto you all my servants the prophets,
   daily rising up early and sending them.
   </span><verse>26</verse><span>Yet they hearkened not unto me, nor inclined their ear, but hardened
   their neck; they did worse than their fathers.</span></block>

   <verse>27</verse><span>Therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them; but they will not
   hearken to thee; thou shalt also call unto them; but they will not
   answer thee.
   </span><verse>28</verse><span>But thou shalt say unto them, ‘This is a nation that obeyeth not the
   voice of the LORD their God, nor receiveth correction; truth is
   perished, and is cut off from their mouth.
   </span><verse>29</verse><span>Cut off thine hair, O Jerusalem, and cast it away, and take up a
   lamentation on high places; for the LORD hath rejected and forsaken the

   <verse>30</verse><span>For the children of Judah have done evil in my sight, saith the LORD;
   they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my
   name, to pollute it.
   </span><verse>31</verse><span>And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley
   of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the
   fire; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart.
   </span><verse>32</verse><span>Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it shall no more
   be called Tophet, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of
   slaughter; for they shall bury in Tophet, till there be no place.
   </span><verse>33</verse><span>And the carcasses of this people shall be meat for the fowls of the
   heaven, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall fray them away.
   </span><verse>34</verse><span>Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the
   streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the
   voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride; for the land shall

    <verse>2</verse><span>Thou shalt not take thee a wife, neither shalt thou have sons nor

    </span><verse>3</verse><span>For thus saith the LORD concerning the sons and concerning the
    daughters that are born in this place, and concerning their mothers that
    bare them, and concerning their fathers that begat them in this land:
    </span><verse>4</verse><span>They shall die of grievous deaths; they shall not be lamented; neither
    shall they be buried; but they shall be as dung upon the face of the

    </span><verse>6</verse><span>Both the great and the small shall die in this land; they shall not be
    buried, neither shall men lament for them, nor cut themselves, nor make

    all this great evil against us? Or what is our iniquity? Or what is our
    sin that we have committed against the LORD our God?’
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>Then shalt thou say unto them, ‘Because your fathers have forsaken me,
    saith the LORD, and have walked after other gods, and have served them,
    and have worshipped them, and have forsaken me, and have not kept my
    law;
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>and ye have done worse than your fathers; for, behold, ye walk everyone
    after the imagination of his evil heart, that they may not hearken unto
    me;
    </span><verse>13</verse><span>therefore will I cast you out of this land into a land that ye know

  <verse>1</verse><span>The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when king Zedekiah
  sent unto him Pashur the son of Melchiah, and Zephaniah the son of
  Maaseiah the priest, saying, “</span><verse>2</verse><span>Inquire, I pray thee, of the LORD for us; for Nebuchadrezzar king of
  Babylon maketh war against us; if so be that the LORD will deal with us
  according to all his wondrous works, that he may go up from us.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>Then said Jeremiah unto them:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>
    Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah,
    </span><verse>4</verse><span>“Thus saith the
    LORD God of Israel: Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are
    in your hands, wherewith ye fight against the king of Babylon, and against
    the Chaldeans, which besiege you without the walls, and I will assemble
    them into the midst of this city.
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>And I myself
    will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm,
    even in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath.
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>And I will smite the inhabitants of this city,
    both man and beast; they shall die of a great pestilence.
    </span><verse>7</verse><span>And afterward, saith the LORD, I will deliver
    Zedekiah king of Judah, and his servants, and the people, and such as are
    left in this city from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the
    famine, into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand
    of their enemies, and into the hand of those that seek their life; and he
    shall smite them with the edge of the sword; he shall not spare them,
    neither have pity, nor have mercy.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>8</verse><span>And unto this people thou shalt say, “Thus saith the LORD: Behold, I
    set before you the way of life, and the way of death.
    </span><verse>9</verse><span>He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine,
    and by the pestilence; but he that goeth out, and falleth to the
    Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be unto
    him for a prey.
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>For I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for good,

   <block>
    <verse>11</verse><span>And touching the house of the king of Judah, say, “Hear ye the word of the LORD;</span><break></break>

    blood in this place.
    </span><verse>4</verse><span>For if ye do this thing

  <verse>1</verse><span>The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in
  the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that was

  </span><verse>2</verse><span>the which Jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of

  </span><quote>
   <block>
    <verse>3</verse><span>From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, even
    unto this day, that is the three and twentieth year, the word of the
    LORD hath come unto me, and I have spoken unto you, rising early and
    speaking; but ye have not hearkened.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>4</verse><span>And the LORD hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets, rising
    early and sending them; but ye have not hearkened, nor inclined your ear
    to hear.
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>They said, “Turn ye again now everyone from his evil way, and from the
    evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that the LORD hath given unto
    you and to your fathers forever and ever;

    <verse>8</verse><span>Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts: Because ye have not heard my

    </span><verse>9</verse><span>behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, saith the
    LORD, and Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring
    them against this land, and against the inhabitants thereof, and against
    all these nations round about, and will utterly destroy them, and make
    them an astonishment, and a hissing, and perpetual desolations.
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth, and the voice of
    gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the
    sound of the millstones, and the light of the candle.
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>And this whole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment; and
    these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>12</verse><span>And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, that I

    perpetual desolations.
    </span><verse>13</verse><span>And I will bring upon that
    land all my words which I have pronounced against it, even all that is
    written in this book, which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the
    nations.
    </span><verse>14</verse><span>For many nations and great kings shall

  <verse>1</verse><span>In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of

   <verse>2</verse><span>Thus saith the LORD: Stand in the court of the

   worship in the LORD’s house, all the words that I command thee to speak

   </span><verse>3</verse><span>If so be they
   will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way,

    <note><span>that I may repent me of</span></note><span>and repent, I will turn away</span></under><span>
   the evil which I purpose to do unto

   </span><verse>4</verse><span>And
   thou shalt say unto them, “Thus saith the LORD: If ye will not hearken to

   prophets, whom I sent unto you, commanding them to rise up early, and

   </span><dunder><span>for ye have not hearkened unto my servants the prophets</span></dunder><span>.”
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah
  speaking these words in the house of the LORD.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that
  the LORD had commanded him to speak unto all the people, that the
  priests and the prophets and all the people took him, saying, “Thou
  shalt surely die.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, ‘This house
  shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate without an
  inhabitant?’” And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the
  house of the LORD.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up from
  the king’s house unto the house of the LORD, and sat down in the entry
  of the new gate of the LORD’s house.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>Then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the
  people, saying, “This man is worthy to die; for he hath prophesied
  against this city, as ye have heard with your ears.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>Then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people, saying,

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the

  </span><verse>17</verse><span>Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spake to all the
  assembly of the people, saying,
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>“Micah the
  Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spake to
  all the people of Judah, saying, ‘Thus saith the LORD of hosts: Zion shall
  be ploughed like a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the
  mountain of the house of the LORD as the high places of a forest.’
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>Did Hezekiah, king of Judah, and all Judah put
  him at all to death? Did he not fear the LORD and beseech the LORD
  </span><under>
   <note><span>and the LORD repented him of</span></note><span>and repent? And the Lord turned away</span></under><span>
  the evil which he had
  pronounced against them. Thus by putting Jeremiah to death we might
  procure great evil against our souls.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>But there was a man among the priests, rose up
  and said, that, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjath-Jearim,
  </span><dunder><span>prophesied in the name of the Lord</span></dunder><span>, who also prophesied against
  this city, and against this land, according to all the words of Jeremiah;
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>and when Jehoiakim the king, with all his
  mighty men, and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put
  him to death; but when Urijah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went

    </span><verse>5</verse><span>‘I have made the earth, the man and the beast that are upon the ground,
    by my great power and by my outstretched arm, and have given it unto
    whom it seemed meet unto me.
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar
    the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the field have I

    prophets and your diviners, that be in the midst of you, deceive you,
    neither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed.
    </span><verse>9</verse><span>For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name. I have not sent them,

   <block>
    <verse>10</verse><span>For thus saith the LORD: That after seventy years be accomplished at
    Babylon I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you, in
    causing you to return to this place.
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD,
    thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>Then shall ye call unto me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I
    will hearken unto you.
    </span><verse>13</verse><span>And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all
    your heart.
    </span><verse>14</verse><span>And I will be found of you, saith the LORD; and I will turn away your
    captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the
    places whither I have driven you, saith the LORD; and I will bring you
    again into the place whence I caused you to be carried away
    captive.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>15</verse><span>Because ye have said, “The LORD hath raised us up prophets in Babylon;”

    that thus saith the LORD of the king that sitteth upon the throne of
    David, and of all the people that dwelleth in this city, and of your
    brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity;
    </span><verse>17</verse><span>thus saith the LORD of hosts: Behold, I will
    send upon them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make
    them like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.
    </span><verse>18</verse><span>And I will persecute them with the sword, with
    the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be removed
    to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, and an astonishment, and
    a hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations whither I have driven
    them;
    </span><verse>19</verse><span>because they have not hearkened to my
    words, saith the LORD, which I sent unto them by my servants the prophets,
    commanding them to rise early, and sending them; but ye would not hear,
    saith the LORD.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>20</verse><span>Hear ye therefore the word of the LORD, all ye of the captivity, whom I
    have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon;
    </span><verse>21</verse><span>thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, of Ahab the son of
    Kolaiah, and of Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, which prophesy a lie unto
    you in my name: Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of
    Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall slay them before your eyes;
    </span><verse>22</verse><span>and of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah
    which are in Babylon, saying, ‘The LORD make thee like Zedekiah and like
    Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire;’
    </span><verse>23</verse><span>because they have committed villainy in Israel, and have committed
    adultery with their neighbors’ wives, and have spoken lying words in my
    name, which I have not commanded them; even I know, and am a witness,
    saith the LORD.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>24</verse><span>Thus shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying:
    </span><verse>25</verse><span>Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying: Because
    thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people that are at
    Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all
    the priests, saying,
    </span><verse>26</verse><span>“The LORD hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest,
    that ye should be officers in the house of the LORD, for every man that
    is mad, and maketh himself a prophet, that thou shouldest put him in
    prison, and in the stocks.
    </span><verse>27</verse><span>Now therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth, which
    maketh himself a prophet to you?
    </span><verse>28</verse><span>For therefore he sent unto us in Babylon, saying, “This captivity is
    long; build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the
    fruit of them.’”</span></block>

  </quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>29</verse><span>And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the
  prophet.
  </span><verse>30</verse><span>Then
  came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying:
  </span><quote>
   <verse>31</verse><span>Send to all them of the captivity, saying, “Thus saith the LORD
   concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because that Shemaiah hath
   prophesied unto you, and I sent him not, and he caused you to trust in a
   lie;
   </span><verse>32</verse><span>therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the
   Nehelamite, and his seed; he shall not have a man to dwell among this
   people; neither shall he behold the good that I will do for my people,
   saith the LORD; because he hath taught rebellion against the
   LORD.”</span></quote>

    shall come unto thee, saying, ‘Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth; for
    the right of redemption is thine to buy it.’
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>So
    Hanameel mine uncle’s son came to me in the court of the prison according
    to the word of the LORD, and said unto me, ‘Buy my field, I pray thee,
    that is in Anathoth, which is in the country of Benjamin; for the right of
    inheritance is thine, and the redemption is thine; buy it for thyself.’
    Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>9</verse><span>And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle’s son, that was in
    Anathoth, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver.
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed it, and took witnesses, and
    weighed him the money in the balances.
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>So I took the evidence of the purchase, both that which was sealed
    according to the law and custom, and that which was open;
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>and I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah,
    the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of
    Hanameel mine uncle’s son, and in the presence of the witnesses that
    subscribed the book of the purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the
    court of the prison.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>13</verse><span>And I charged Baruch before them saying,
    </span><verse>14</verse><span>“Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these evidences,
    this evidence of the purchase, both which is sealed, and this evidence
    which is open; and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may continue
    many days.
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Houses and fields
    and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>16</verse><span>Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the

     <verse>17</verse><span>Ah Lord GOD! Behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy
     great power and stretched-out arm, and there is nothing too hard for
     thee;
     </span><verse>18</verse><span>thou showest loving-kindness unto thousands, and recompensest the
     iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them; The
     Great, The Mighty God, The LORD of hosts, is his name;
     </span><verse>19</verse><span>great in counsel, and mighty in work; for thine eyes are open upon all
     the ways of the sons of men, to give everyone according to his ways, and
     according to the fruit of his doings;
     </span><verse>20</verse><span>which hast set signs and wonder in the land of Egypt, even unto this
     day, and in Israel, and among other men; and hast made thee a name, as
     at this day;
     </span><verse>21</verse><span>and hast brought forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with
     signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with a
     stretched-out arm, and with great terror;
     </span><verse>22</verse><span>and hast given them this land, which thou didst swear to their fathers
     to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;
     </span><verse>23</verse><span>and they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not thy voice,
     neither walked in thy law; they have done nothing of all that thou
     commandedest them to do; therefore thou hast caused all this evil to
     come upon them.</span></quote>
    <quote>
     <verse>24</verse><span>Behold the mounts, they are come unto the city to take it; and the city

     hast spoken is come to pass; and, behold, thou seest it.
     </span><verse>25</verse><span>And thou hast said unto me, O Lord GOD, “Buy thee the field for money,

    <verse>30</verse><span>For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done
    evil before me from their youth; for the children of Israel have only

    </span><verse>31</verse><span>For this city hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger and of my
    fury from the day that they built it even unto this day, that I should
    remove it from before my face;

    kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of
    Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
    </span><verse>33</verse><span>And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face; though I
    taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not
    hearkened to receive instruction.
    </span><verse>34</verse><span>But they set their abominations in the house, which is called by my
    name, to defile it.
    </span><verse>35</verse><span>And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the
    son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters

    neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to
    cause Judah to sin.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>36</verse><span>And now therefore thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning

    </span><verse>37</verse><span>behold, I will gather them out of all countries, whither I have driven
    them in mine anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring
    them again unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely;
    </span><verse>38</verse><span>and they shall be my people, and I will be their God;
    </span><verse>39</verse><span>and I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me

    </span><verse>40</verse><span>and I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn
    away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts,
    that they shall not depart from me.
    </span><verse>41</verse><span>Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in
    this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>42</verse><span>For thus saith the LORD: Like as I have brought all this great evil

  Jerusalem forsakes their covenant to free servants

  <verse>8</verse><span>This is the word that came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, after that the
  king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people which were at
  Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty unto them;
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>that every man should let his manservant, and every man his
  maidservant, being a Hebrew or a Hebrewess, go free; that none should
  serve himself of them, to wit, of a Jew his brother.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>Now when all the princes, and all the people, which had entered into
  the covenant, heard that everyone should let his manservant, and
  everyone his maidservant, go free, that none should serve themselves of
  them anymore; then they obeyed, and let them go.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>But afterwards they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids,
  whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection

    let ye go every man his brother a Hebrew, which hath been sold unto thee;
    and when he hath served thee six years, thou shalt let him go free from
    thee;” but your fathers hearkened not unto me, neither inclined their ear.

    made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name.

  <verse>9</verse><span>And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah
  king of Judah, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a fast before

  </span><verse>10</verse><span>Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the

  </span><verse>11</verse><span>When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of
  the book all the words of the LORD,

  Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and
  Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of

  Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came unto them.

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they were

  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And they asked Baruch, saying, “Tell us now, how didst thou write all
  these words at his mouth?”
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>Then Baruch answered them, “He pronounced all these words unto me with
  his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.”
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>Then said the princes unto Baruch, “Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah;
  and let no man know where ye be.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up the roll

  </span><verse>21</verse><span>So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll; and he took it out of

  <verse>22</verse><span>Now the king sat in the winter house in the ninth month; and there was

  cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was on the
  hearth, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was on the
  hearth.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the king,
  nor any of his servants that heard all these words.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>25</verse><span>Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to
  the king that he would not burn the roll; but he would not hear them.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the
  son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the

  <verse>27</verse><span>Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after that the king had

    <verse>28</verse><span>Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that

  Nergal-sharezer, Rab-mag, with all the residue of the princes of the

  <verse>4</verse><span>And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no
  man knew it,
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>that
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  there came certain from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even
  fourscore men, having their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and
  having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring
  them to the house of the LORD.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And Ishmael the
  son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as
  he went; and it came to pass, as he met them, he said unto them, “Come to
  Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.”
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And it was so, when
  they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah
  slew them, and cast them into the midst of the pit, he, and the men that
  were with him.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>But ten men were found among them
  that said unto Ishmael, “Slay us not; for we have treasures in the field,
  of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey.” So he forbare, and
  slew them not among their brethren.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>Now the pit
  wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men, whom he had slain
  because of Gedaliah, was it which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha
  king of Israel; and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with them that
  were slain.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that
  were in Mizpah, even the king’s daughters, and all the people that
  remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzar- adan the captain of the guard had
  committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam; and Ishmael the son of
  Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the
  Ammonites.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces
  that were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of
  Nethaniah had done,
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of
  Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>Now it came to pass, that when all the people which were with Ishmael
  saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that
  were with him, then they were glad.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah
  cast about and returned, and went unto Johanan the son of Kareah.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men,
  and went to the Ammonites.

  from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after that he had slain
  Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, even mighty men of war, and the women, and
  the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought again from Gibeon;
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>and they departed, and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham, which is by
  Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt,
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>because of the Chaldeans; for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael
  the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king
  of Babylon made governor in the land.

  <verse>7</verse><span>And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the LORD came unto

   <block><span>
    Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, unto whom ye sent me to present

    </span><verse>10</verse><span>If you will still

    you, and not pluck up;
    </span><under>

    </span><verse>11</verse><span>Be not afraid of the king of

    I am with you to save you, and to deliver you from his hand.
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>And I will show mercies unto you, that he may
    have mercy upon you, and cause you to return to your own land.

   <block>
    <verse>13</verse><span>But if ye say, “We will not dwell in this land,” neither obey the voice

    no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger for want of

   <block><span>
    Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: If ye wholly set your
    faces to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn there;
    </span><verse>16</verse><span>then it shall come to pass, that the sword,
    which ye feared, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt; and the
    famine, whereof ye were afraid, shall follow close after you there in
    Egypt; and there ye shall die.
    </span><verse>17</verse><span>So shall it be
    with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there;
    they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; and
    none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon
    them.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>18</verse><span>For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: As mine anger and

    shall my fury be poured forth upon you, when ye shall enter into Egypt;
    and ye shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a
    reproach; and ye shall see this place no more.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>19</verse><span>The LORD hath said concerning you, O ye remnant of Judah: Go ye not

    </span><verse>21</verse><span>And now I have this day declared it to you, that

   Thou speakest falsely; the LORD our God hath not sent thee to say, “Go not

   <block>
    <verse>2</verse><span>Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Ye have seen all the

    therein;
    </span><verse>3</verse><span>because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to

    they knew not, neither they, ye, nor your fathers.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>4</verse><span>Howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, commanding them

    </span><verse>5</verse><span>But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their

    <verse>7</verse><span>Therefore now thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel:

    </span><verse>8</verse><span>In that ye provoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands, burning

  <verse>15</verse><span>Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense unto

  Jeremiah, saying:</span><quote>
   <verse>16</verse><span>As for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the LORD,
   we will not hearken unto thee.
   </span><verse>17</verse><span>But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own
   mouth, to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink
   offerings unto her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and
   our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem;
   for then had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil,
   </span><verse>18</verse><span>but since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to
   pour out drink offerings unto her, we have wanted all things, and have
   been consumed by the sword and by the famine.
   </span><verse>19</verse><span>And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink
   offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out
   drink offerings unto her, without our men?</span></quote>

  <verse>20</verse><span>Then Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men and to the women,

   <verse>21</verse><span>The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets
   of Jerusalem, ye and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the
   people of the land, did not the LORD remember them, and came it not into
   his mind?
   </span><verse>22</verse><span>So that the LORD could no longer bear, because of the evil of your
   doings, and because of the abominations which ye have committed;
   therefore is your land a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse,
   without an inhabitant, as at this day.
   </span><verse>23</verse><span>Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned against the
   LORD, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, nor walked in his law,
   nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil is
   happened unto you, as at this day.</span></quote>

  <verse>24</verse><span>Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the women:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>Hear the word of the LORD, all Judah that are in the land of Egypt;
    </span><verse>25</verse><span>thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of
    Israel, saying: Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and
    fulfilled with your hand, saying, “We will surely perform our vows that we
    have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink
    offerings unto her;” ye will surely accomplish your vows, and surely
    perform your vows.
    </span><verse>26</verse><span>Therefore hear ye the word
    of the LORD, all Judah that dwell in the land of Egypt: Behold, I have
    sworn by my great name, saith the LORD, that my name shall no more be
    named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying,
    “The Lord GOD liveth.”
    </span><verse>27</verse><span>Behold, I will watch
    over them for evil, and not for good; and all the men of Judah that are in
    the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until
    there be an end of them.
    </span><verse>28</verse><span>Yet a small number
    that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land
    of Judah; and all the remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of
    Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose words shall stand, mine, or
    theirs.‌</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>29</verse><span>And this shall be a sign unto you, saith the LORD, that I will punish
    you in this place, that ye may know that my words shall surely stand

    </span><verse>30</verse><span>thus saith the LORD: Behold, I will give Pharaoh-hophra king of Egypt
    into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his

  <verse>38</verse><span>There shall be lamentation generally upon all the housetops of Moab,</span><break></break>

  <indent><span>shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.</span></indent>
  <verse>42</verse><span>And Moab shall be destroyed from being a people,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>because he hath magnified himself against the LORD.</span></indent>
  <verse>43</verse><span>Fear, and the pit, and the snare, shall be upon thee,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>O inhabitant of Moab, saith the LORD.</span></indent>

  for I will bring upon it, even upon Moab,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the year of their visitation, saith the LORD.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>45</verse><span>They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon</span><break></break>

  <verse>46</verse><span>Woe be unto thee, O Moab!</span><break></break>

  <verse>30</verse><span>Flee, get you far off, dwell deep,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>O ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith the LORD;</span></indent><span>
  for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and hath conceived a purpose against you.</span></indent>
  <verse>31</verse><span>Arise, get you up unto the wealthy nation,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>that dwelleth without care, saith the LORD,</span></indent><span>
  which have neither gates nor bars,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>which dwell alone.</span></indent>
  <verse>32</verse><span>And their camels shall be a booty,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the multitude of their cattle a spoil;</span></indent><span>
  and I will scatter into all winds them that are in the utmost corners;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof, saith the LORD.</span></indent>
  <verse>33</verse><span>And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons,</span><break></break>

  A message concerning Elam
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>34</verse><span>The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against Elam in
  the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying:
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>35</verse><span>Thus saith the LORD of hosts:</span><break></break><span>
  Behold, I will break the bow of Elam,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the chief of their might.</span></indent>
  <verse>36</verse><span>And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and will scatter them toward all those winds;</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come.</span></indent>
  <verse>37</verse><span>For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and before them that seek their life;</span></indent><span>
  and I will bring evil upon them,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>even my fierce anger, saith the LORD;</span></indent><span>
  and I will send the sword after them,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>till I have consumed them;</span></indent>
  <verse>38</verse><span>And I will set my throne in Elam,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and will destroy from thence the king and the princes, saith the LORD.</span></indent>
  <verse>39</verse><span>But it shall come to pass in the latter days,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>that I will bring again the captivity of Elam, saith the LORD.</span></indent>

 <chapter>50
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>The word that the LORD spake against Babylon and against the land of
  the Chaldeans by Jeremiah the prophet:
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>Declare ye among the nations,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and publish, and set up a standard;</span></indent>
  <indent><span>publish, and conceal not;</span></indent><span>
  say, “Babylon is taken,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>Bel is confounded,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>Merodach is broken in pieces;</span></indent><span>
  her idols are confounded,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>her images are broken in pieces.”</span></indent>
  <verse>3</verse><span>For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>which shall make her land desolate,</span></indent><span>
  and none shall dwell therein; they shall remove,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>they shall depart, both man and beast.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the children of Israel shall come,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>they and the children of Judah together,</span></indent><span>
  going and weeping;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>they shall go, and seek the LORD their God.</span></indent>
  <verse>5</verse><span>They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>saying, “Come, and let us join ourselves to the LORD</span></indent>
  <indent><span>in a perpetual covenant that shall not be forgotten.”</span></indent>
  <verse>6</verse><span>My people have been lost sheep;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>their shepherds have caused them to go astray,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>they have turned them away on the mountains;</span></indent><span>
  they have gone from mountain to hill,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>they have forgotten their resting place.</span></indent>
  <verse>7</verse><span>All that found them have devoured them;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and their adversaries said, “We offend not,</span></indent><span>
  because they have sinned against the LORD, the habitation of justice,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>even the LORD, the hope of their fathers.”</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>Remove out of the midst of Babylon,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and be as the he goats before the flocks.</span></indent>
  <verse>9</verse><span>For, lo, I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>an assembly of great nations from the north country;</span></indent><span>
  and they shall set themselves in array against her;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>from thence she shall be taken;</span></indent><span>
  their arrows shall be as of a mighty expert man;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>none shall return in vain.</span></indent>
  <verse>10</verse><span>And Chaldea shall be a spoil;</span><break></break>

  <verse>12</verse><span>Your mother shall be sore confounded;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>she that bare you shall be ashamed;</span></indent><span>
  behold, the hindermost of the nations shall be a wilderness,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>a dry land, and a desert.</span></indent>
  <verse>13</verse><span>Because of the wrath of the LORD it shall not be inhabited,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>but it shall be wholly desolate;</span></indent><span>
  everyone that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished,</span><break></break>

  <indent><span>all ye that bend the bow,</span></indent><span>

  <verse>15</verse><span>Shout against her round about;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>she hath given her hand;</span></indent>
  <indent><span>her foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down;</span></indent><span>
  for it is the vengeance of the LORD;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>take vengeance upon her;</span></indent>
  <indent><span>as she hath done, do unto her.</span></indent>
  <verse>16</verse><span>Cut off the sower from Babylon,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest;</span></indent><span>
  for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn everyone to his people,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and they shall flee everyone to his own land.</span></indent>
  <verse>17</verse><span>Israel is a scattered sheep</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the lions have driven him away;</span></indent><span>
  first the king of Assyria hath devoured him;</span><break></break>

  <verse>19</verse><span>And I will bring Israel again to his habitation,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and his soul shall be satisfied upon mount Ephraim and Gilead.</span></indent>
  <verse>20</verse><span>In those days, and in that time saith the LORD, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for,</span><break></break>

  <verse>24</verse><span>I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon,</span><break></break>

  <verse>25</verse><span>The LORD hath opened his armory,</span><break></break>

  <verse>26</verse><span>Come against her from the utmost border,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>open her storehouses;</span></indent><span>
  cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly;</span><break></break>

  <verse>27</verse><span>Slay all her bullocks;</span><break></break>

  <indent><span>let none thereof escape;</span></indent><span>
  recompense her according to her work;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>according to all that she hath done, do unto her;</span></indent><span>
  for she hath been proud against the LORD,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>against the Holy One of Israel.</span></indent>
  <verse>30</verse><span>Therefore shall her young men fall in the streets,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD.</span></indent>

  <verse>33</verse><span>Thus saith the LORD of hosts:</span><break></break><span>
  The children of Israel and the children of Judah were oppressed together;</span><break></break>

  <verse>34</verse><span>Their Redeemer is strong;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>The LORD of hosts is his name;</span></indent><span>
  he shall thoroughly plead their cause,</span><break></break>

  a sword is upon her mighty men;</span><break></break>

  <verse>37</verse><span>A sword is upon their horses, and upon their chariots,</span><break></break>

  <verse>38</verse><span>A drought is upon her waters;</span><break></break>

  <verse>44</verse><span>Behold, he shall come up like a lion</span><break></break>

  <verse>34</verse><span>Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon hath devoured me,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he hath crushed me, he hath made me an empty vessel,</span></indent><span>
  he hath swallowed me up like a dragon,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he hath filled his belly with my delicates,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>he hath cast me out.</span></indent>
  <verse>35</verse><span>The violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon,</span><break></break>

  <verse>36</verse><span>Therefore thus saith the LORD:</span><break></break><span>
  Behold, I will plead thy cause,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and take vengeance for thee;</span></indent><span>
  and I will dry up her sea,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and make her springs dry.</span></indent>
  <verse>37</verse><span>And Babylon shall become heaps,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>a dwelling place for dragons,</span></indent><span>
  an astonishment, and a hissing,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>without an inhabitant.</span></indent>
  <verse>38</verse><span>They shall roar together like lions;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>they shall yell as lions’ whelps.</span></indent>
  <verse>39</verse><span>In their heat I will make their feasts,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and I will make them drunken,</span></indent><span>
  that they may rejoice,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the LORD.</span></indent>
 </block>

  <verse>40</verse><span>I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter,</span><break></break>

  <verse>41</verse><span>How is Sheshach taken!</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>And how is the praise of the whole earth surprised!</span></indent>
  <indent><span>How is Babylon become an astonishment among the nations!</span></indent>
  <verse>42</verse><span>The sea is come up upon Babylon;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof.</span></indent>
  <verse>43</verse><span>Her cities are a desolation,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>a dry land, and a wilderness,</span></indent><span>
  a land wherein no man dwelleth,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>neither doth any son of man pass thereby.</span></indent>
  <verse>44</verse><span>And I will punish Bel in Babylon,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up;</span></indent><span>
  and the nations shall not flow together anymore unto him;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>yea, the wall of Babylon shall fall.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>45</verse><span>My people, go ye out of the midst of her,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and deliver ye every man his soul from the fierce anger of the LORD.</span></indent>
  <verse>46</verse><span>And lest your heart faint, and ye fear for the rumor that shall be heard in the land;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>a rumor shall both come one year, and after that in another year shall come a rumor,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and violence in the land, ruler against ruler.</span></indent>
  <verse>47</verse><span>Therefore, behold, the days come,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>that I will do judgment upon the graven images of Babylon;</span></indent><span>
  and her whole land shall be confounded,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.</span></indent>
  <verse>48</verse><span>Then the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein, shall sing for Babylon;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>for the spoilers shall come unto her from the north, saith the LORD.</span></indent>

  <verse>49</verse><span>As Babylon hath caused the slain of Israel to fall,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth.</span></indent>
  <verse>50</verse><span>Ye that have escaped the sword,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>go away, stand not still;</span></indent><span>
  remember the LORD afar off,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and let Jerusalem come into your mind.</span></indent>

 <block>
  <verse>51</verse><span>We are confounded,</span><break></break>

  <verse>53</verse><span>Though Babylon should mount up to heaven,</span><break></break>

  <verse>54</verse><span>A sound of a cry cometh from Babylon,</span><break></break>

  when her waves do roar like great waters,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>a noise of their voice is uttered;</span></indent>
  <verse>56</verse><span>Because the spoiler is come upon her, even upon Babylon,</span><break></break>

  <verse>58</verse><span>Thus saith the LORD of hosts:</span><break></break><span>
  The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly broken,</span><break></break>

  <verse>59</verse><span>The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of
  Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of
  Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And this Seraiah was
  quiet prince.
  </span><verse>60</verse><span>So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon,
  even all these words that are written against Babylon.
  </span><verse>61</verse><span>And Jeremiah said to Seraiah:
  </span><quote><span>
   When thou comest to Babylon, and shalt see, and shalt read all these
   words;
   </span><verse>62</verse><span>then shalt thou say, ‘O Lord, thou hast
   spoken against this place, to cut it off, that none shall remain in it,
   neither man nor beast, but that it shall be desolate forever.’
   </span><verse>63</verse><span>And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of
   reading this book, that thou shalt bind a
   stone to it, and cast it into the midst of Euphrates;
   </span><verse>64</verse><span>and thou shalt say, ‘Thus shall Babylon sink,
   and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon her; and they
   shall be weary.’

  Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.

  The fall of Jerusalem
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>52
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he
  reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Hamutal the
  daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD, according to
  all that Jehoiakim had done.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and
  Judah, till he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah
  rebelled against the king of Babylon.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month,
  in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came,
  he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it, and
  built forts against it round about.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And in the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was
  sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and went
  forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two
  walls, which was by the king’s garden; (now the Chaldeans were by the
  city round about) and they went by the way of the plain.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook
  Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from
  him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to
  Riblah in the land of Hamath; where he gave judgment upon him.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes; he
  slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him
  in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the
  day of his death.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the
  nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzar-adan,
  captain of the guard, which served the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem,
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>and burned the house of the LORD, and the king’s house; and all the
  houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the great men, burned he with
  fire;
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>and all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the
  guard, brake down all the walls of Jerusalem round about.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>Then Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away captive certain
  of the poor of the people, and the residue of the people that remained
  in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon,
  and the rest of the multitude.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>But Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard left certain of the poor of
  the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>Also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the
  bases, and the brazen sea that was in the house of the LORD, the
  Chaldeans brake, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls,
  and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered,
  took they away.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And the basins, and the firepans, and the bowls, and the caldrons, and
  the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups; that which was of gold
  in gold, and that which was of silver in silver, took the captain of the
  guard away.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brazen bulls that were under the
  bases, which king Solomon had made in the house of the LORD; the brass
  of all these vessels was without weight.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>And concerning the pillars, the height
  of one pillar was eighteen cubits; and a fillet of twelve cubits did
  compass it; and the thickness thereof was four fingers; it was hollow.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>And a chapiter of brass was upon it; and the
  height of one chapiter was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon
  the chapiters round about, all of brass. The second pillar also and the
  pomegranates were like unto these.
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>And there
  were ninety and six pomegranates on a side; and all the pomegranates upon
  the network were a hundred round about.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and
  Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door;
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>he took also out of the city a eunuch, which had the charge of the men
  of war; and seven men of them that were near the king’s person, which
  were found in the city; and the principal scribe of the host, who
  mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the
  land, that were found in the midst of the city.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>So Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to
  the king of Babylon to Riblah.
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in Riblah in
  the land of Hamath.
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  Thus Judah was carried away captive out of his own land.
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried
  away captive: In the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and
  twenty.
  </span><verse>29</verse><span>In the eighteenth year of
  Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty
  and two persons.
  </span><verse>30</verse><span>In the three and twentieth
  year of Nebuchadrezzar, Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away
  captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons. All the persons
  were four thousand and six hundred.

  Jehoiachin released

 <block>
  <verse>31</verse><span>And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of
  Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and
  twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon, in the
  first year of his reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah,
  and brought him forth out of prison,
  </span><verse>32</verse><span>and spake kindly unto him, and set his throne above the throne of the
  kings that were with him in Babylon.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>33</verse><span>And changed his prison garments; and he did continually eat bread
  before him all the days of his life.
  </span><verse>34</verse><span>And for his diet, there was a continual diet given him of the king of
  Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of
  his life.
