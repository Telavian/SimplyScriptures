  Daniel’s arrival in Babylon
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>1
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came
  Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And the LORD gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of
  the vessels of the house of God; which he carried into the land of
  Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the
  treasure house of his god.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he
  should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of the king’s seed,
  and of the princes;
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>children in whom was no blemish, but well favored, and skillful in all
  wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as
  had ability in them to stand in the king’s palace, and whom they might
  teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king’s meat, and
  of the wine which he drank; so nourishing them three years, that at the
  end thereof they might stand before the king.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah,
  Mishael, and Azariah;
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names; for he gave unto Daniel
  the name of Beltheshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael,
  of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with
  the portion of the king’s meat, nor with the wine which he drank;
  therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not
  defile himself.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>Now God had brought Daniel into favor and tender love with the prince
  of the eunuchs.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, “I fear my lord the
  king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink; for why should he see
  your faces worse liking than the children which are of your sort? Then
  shall ye make me endanger my head to the king.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over
  Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>“Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us
  pulse to eat, and water to drink.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the
  countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king’s meat;
  and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.”
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and
  fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the
  king’s meat.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they
  should drink; and gave them pulse.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all
  learning and wisdom; and Daniel had understanding in all visions and
  dreams.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them
  in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before
  Nebuchadnezzar.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like
  Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; therefore stood they before the
  king.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king inquired
  of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and
  astrologers that were in all his realm.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>Nebuchadnezzar’s dream
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>2
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar
  dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake
  from him.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and
  the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to show the king his dreams. So
  they came and stood before the king.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And the king said unto them, “I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was
  troubled to know the dream.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriac, “O king, live forever;
  tell thy servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, “The thing is gone from
  me; if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation
  thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a
  dunghill.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>But if ye show the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall
  receive of me gifts and rewards and great honor; therefore show me the
  dream, and the interpretation thereof.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>They answered again and said, “Let the king tell his servants the
  dream, and we will show the interpretation of it.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>The king answered and said, “I know of certainty that ye would gain the
  time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but one
  decree for you; for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak
  before me, till the time be changed; therefore tell me the dream, and I
  shall know that ye can show me the interpretation thereof.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, “There is not a man
  upon the earth that can show the king’s matter; therefore there is no
  king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or
  astrologer, or Chaldean.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other
  that can show it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not
  with flesh.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to
  destroy all the wise men of Babylon.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they
  sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of
  the king’s guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon;
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>he answered and said to Arioch the king’s captain, “Why is the decree
  so hasty from the king?” Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him
  time, and that he would show the king the interpretation.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah,
  Mishael, and Azariah, his companions;
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>that they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this
  secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of
  the wise men of Babylon.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel
  blessed the God of heaven.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>Daniel answered and said:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>
    Blessed be the name of God forever and ever;</span><break></break>

    <indent><span>for thou hast now made known unto us the king’s matter.</span></indent>

  Daniel interprets the dream
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to
  destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and said thus unto him,
  “Destroy not the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I
  will show unto the king the interpretation.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>25</verse><span>Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus
  unto him, “I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make
  known unto the king the interpretation.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>26</verse><span>The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, “Art
  thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the
  interpretation thereof?”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>27</verse><span>Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>
    The secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men, the
    astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, show unto the king;
    </span><verse>28</verse><span>but there is a God in heaven that revealeth
    secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the
    latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are
    these:
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>29</verse><span>As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed, what
    should come to pass hereafter; and he that revealeth secrets maketh
    known to thee what shall come to pass.
    </span><verse>30</verse><span>But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I
    have more than any living, but for their sakes that shall make known the
    interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of
    thy heart.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>31</verse><span>Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose
    brightness was excellent, stood before thee, and the form thereof was
    terrible.
    </span><verse>32</verse><span>This image’s head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver,
    his belly and his thighs of brass,
    </span><verse>33</verse><span>his legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.
    </span><verse>34</verse><span>Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote
    the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them to
    pieces.
    </span><verse>35</verse><span>Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold,
    broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer
    threshing floors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was
    found for them; and the stone that smote the image became a great
    mountain, and filled the whole earth.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>36</verse><span>This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before
    the king.
    </span><verse>37</verse><span>Thou,
    O king, art a king of kings; for the God of heaven hath given thee a
    kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.
    </span><verse>38</verse><span>And
    wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the
    fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee
    ruler over them all. Thou art this head of gold.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>39</verse><span>And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and
    another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the
    earth.
    </span><verse>40</verse><span>And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron; forasmuch as iron
    breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things; and as iron that breaketh
    all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.
    </span><verse>41</verse><span>And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters’ clay, and
    part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of
    the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with
    miry clay.
    </span><verse>42</verse><span>And as the toes of the feet were part of iron,
    and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.
    </span><verse>43</verse><span>And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry
    clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men; but they shall
    not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>44</verse><span>And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a
    kingdom, which shall never be destroyed; and the kingdom shall not be
    left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these
    kingdoms, and it shall stand forever.
    </span><verse>45</verse><span>Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain
    without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the
    clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the
    king what shall come to pass hereafter; and the dream is certain, and
    the interpretation thereof sure.</span></block>

  <verse>48</verse><span>Then the king made Daniel a great man, and he gave him many great

  The image of gold and the furnace
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>3
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was
  threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits; he set it up in
  the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes, the
  governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors,
  the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the
  dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the
  treasurers, the counselors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the
  provinces were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that
  Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that
  Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Then a herald cried aloud:</span><quote><span>
   To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages,
   </span><verse>5</verse><span>that at what time ye hear the sound of the
   cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of music,
   ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king
   hath set up;
   </span><verse>6</verse><span>and whoso falleth not down and
   worshipeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery
   furnace.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the
  cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of music, all the
  people, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshiped the
  golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the
  Jews.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>
    O king, live forever.
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>Thou, O king, hast made a
    decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute,
    harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, shall fall
    down and worship the golden image;
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>and whoso
    falleth not down and worshipeth, that he should be cast into the midst of
    a burning fiery furnace.
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the
    province of
    Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; these men, O king, have not
    regarded thee; they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which
    thou hast set up.
   </span></block>

  </quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach,
  Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men before the king.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them:</span><quote><span>
   Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, do not ye serve my gods,
   nor worship the golden image which I have set up?
   </span><verse>15</verse><span>Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear
   the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and
   all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made;
   well; but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst
   of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out
   of my hands?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered and said to the king:</span><quote><span>
   O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter.
   </span><verse>17</verse><span>If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to
   deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of
   thine hand, O king.
   </span><verse>18</verse><span>But if not, be it known
   unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden
   image which thou hast set up.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was
  changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; therefore he spake, and
  commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it
  was wont to be heated.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind
  Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery
  furnace.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their hats,
  and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning
  fiery furnace.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>Therefore because the king’s commandment was urgent, and the furnace
  exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up
  Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound
  into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in haste, and
  spake, and said unto his counselors, “Did not we cast three men bound
  into the midst of the fire?”
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  They answered and said unto the king, “True, O king.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>25</verse><span>He answered and said, “Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst
  of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like
  the Son of God.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>26</verse><span>Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery
  furnace, and spake, and said, “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, ye
  servants of the most high God, come forth, and come hither.”
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, came forth of the midst of the
  fire.
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>And the princes, governors, and captains,
  and the king’s counselors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon
  whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was a hair of their head singed,
  neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on
  them.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>28</verse><span>Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said:</span><quote><span>
   Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his
   angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed
   the king’s word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor
   worship any god, except their own God.
   </span><verse>29</verse><span>Therefore I make a decree, That every people,
   nation, and language, which speak anything amiss against the God of
   Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses
   shall be made a dunghill; because there is no other God that can deliver
   after this sort.

  <verse>4</verse><span>I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house, and flourishing in my

  </span><verse>5</verse><span>I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my bed and

  </span><verse>6</verse><span>Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon

  </span><verse>7</verse><span>Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the

  </span><verse>8</verse><span>But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar,

   <block>
    <verse>9</verse><span>O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit
    of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell me the

    </span><verse>10</verse><span>Thus were the visions of mine head in my bed; I saw, and behold a tree
    in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was great.
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto
    heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth;
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>the leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was
    meat for all; the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls
    of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof, and all flesh was fed of
    it.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>13</verse><span>I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and
    a holy one came down from heaven;
    </span><verse>14</verse><span>he cried aloud, and said thus, “Hew down the tree, and cut off his
    branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit; let the beasts
    get away from under it, and the fowls from his branches;
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>nevertheless, leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even with a
    band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be
    wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts in
    the grass of the earth;
    </span><verse>16</verse><span>let his heart be changed from man’s, and let a beast’s heart be given
    unto him; and let seven times pass over him.

  <verse>19</verse><span>Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonied for one hour,

  let not the dream, or the interpretation thereof, trouble thee.
  Belteshazzar answered and said:

    My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation
    thereof to thine enemies.
    </span><verse>20</verse><span>The tree that thou

    and the sight thereof to all the earth;
    </span><verse>21</verse><span>whose
    leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all;
    under which the beasts of
    the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their
    habitation;
    </span><verse>22</verse><span>it is thou, O king, that art grown
    and become strong; for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven,

  <verse>28</verse><span>All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.
  </span><verse>29</verse><span>At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of

  </span><verse>3</verse><span>Then they brought the golden vessels

  <verse>1</verse><span>It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom a hundred and twenty princes,
  which should be over the whole kingdom;
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>and over these three presidents; of whom Daniel was first, that the
  princes might give accounts unto them, and the king should have no
  damage.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes,
  because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him
  over the whole realm.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel
  concerning the kingdom; but they could find none occasion nor fault;
  forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found
  in him.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>Then said these men, “We shall not find any occasion against this
  Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his
  God.”

  <verse>6</verse><span>Then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king, and

   </span><verse>7</verse><span>All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the
   counselors, and the captains, have consulted together to establish a
   royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever shall ask a
   petition of any God, or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he
   shall be cast into the den of lions.
   </span><verse>8</verse><span>Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it be not

  <verse>10</verse><span>Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his
  house; and, his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he
  kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks
  before his God, as he did aforetime.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making
  supplication before his God.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the king’s
  decree:</span><quote><span>
   Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man that shall ask a petition of
   any God or man within thirty days, save of thee, O king, shall be cast
   into the den of lions?
  </span></quote>

  The king answered and said:
  </span><quote><span>
   The thing is true, according to the law of Medes and Persians, which

 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>Then answered they and said before the king:</span><quote><span>
   That Daniel, which is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth
   not thee, O king, nor the decree that thou hast signed, but maketh his
   petition three times a day.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased with
  himself, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him; and he labored till
  the going down of the sun to deliver him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>Then these men assembled unto the king and said unto the king:</span><quote><span>
   Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, that no decree
   nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the
  den of lions. Now the king spake and said unto Daniel:</span><quote><span>
   Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the
  king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords;
  that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting; neither
  were instruments of music brought before him; and his sleep went from
  him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto
  the den of lions.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice unto
  Daniel, and the king spake and said to Daniel:</span><quote><span>
   O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest
   continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>Then said Daniel unto the king:</span><quote><span>
   O king, live forever.
   </span><verse>22</verse><span>My God hath sent his
   angel, and hath shut the lions’ mouths, that they have not hurt me;
   forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O
   king, have I done no hurt.
  </span></quote>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and commanded that they
  should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the
  den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in
  his God.

  <verse>24</verse><span>And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had accused
  Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children,

  Dream of four beasts

 <chapter>7
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream and
  visions of his head upon his bed; then he wrote the dream, and told the
  sum of the matters.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>Daniel spake and said:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>
    I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven
    strove upon the great sea.
    </span><verse>3</verse><span>And four great beasts
    came up from the sea, diverse one from another.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>4</verse><span>The first was like a lion, and had eagle’s wings; I beheld till the
    wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and
    made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man’s heart was given to
    it.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>5</verse><span>And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up
    itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the
    teeth of it; and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>6</verse><span>After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the
    back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and
    dominion was given to it.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>7</verse><span>After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast,
    dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron
    teeth; it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the
    feet of it; and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it;
    and it had ten horns.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>8</verse><span>I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another
    little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up
    by the roots; and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man,
    and a mouth speaking great things.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>9</verse><span>I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did
    sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the
    pure wool; his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as
    burning fire.
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him; thousand
    thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood
    before him; the judgment was set, and the books were opened.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>11</verse><span>I beheld then, because of the voice of the great words which the horn
    spake; I beheld even till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed,
    and given to the burning flame.
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken
    away; yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>13</verse><span>I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came
    with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they
    brought him near before him.
    </span><verse>14</verse><span>And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all
    people, nations, and languages, should serve him; his dominion is an
    everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that
    which shall not be destroyed.</span></block>

  Interpretation of the dream

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>I, Daniel, was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body, and the

  </span><verse>16</verse><span>I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of
  all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the
  things.</span><quote>
   <verse>17</verse><span>These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise
   out of the earth.

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from
  all the other, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and his
  nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue
  with his feet;
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And of the ten horns that were in his head, and of the other which came
  up, and before whom three fell; even of that horn that had eyes, and a
  mouth that spake very great things, whose look was more stout than his
  fellows.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed
  against them;
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of
  the Most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the
  kingdom.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>Thus he said:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>
    The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be
    diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall
    tread it down, and break it in pieces.
    </span><verse>24</verse><span>And the
    ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise; and another
    shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he
    shall subdue three kings.
    </span><verse>25</verse><span>And he shall speak
    great words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the
    Most High, and think to change times and laws; and they shall be given
    into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>26</verse><span>But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to
    consume and to destroy it unto the end.
    </span><verse>27</verse><span>And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under
    the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most

    serve and obey him.</span></block>

  Vision of a ram and a goat
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>8
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared
  unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the
  first.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at
  Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in a
  vision, and I was by the river Ulai.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before
  the river a ram which had two horns; and the two horns were high; but
  one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that
  no beasts might stand before him neither was there any that could
  deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became
  great.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>And as I was considering, behold, a he goat came from the west on the
  face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground; and the goat had a
  notable horn between his eyes.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen standing
  before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler
  against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns; and there was
  no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the
  ground, and stamped upon him; and there was none that could deliver the
  ram out of his hand.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>Therefore the he goat waxed very great; and when he was strong, the
  great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the
  four winds of heaven.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding
  great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant
  land.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And it waxed great, even to
  the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to
  the ground, and stamped upon them.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>Yea, he
  magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily
  sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>And a host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of
  transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it
  practiced, and prospered.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that
  certain saint which spake, “How long shall be the vision concerning the
  daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the
  sanctuary and the host to be trodden underfoot?”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>And he said unto me, “Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then
  shall the sanctuary be cleansed.”
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>Interpretation of the vision
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, and
  sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the
  appearance of a man.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And I heard a man’s voice between the banks of Ulai, which called, and
  said, “Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>So he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was afraid, and fell
  upon my face; but he said unto me, “Understand, O son of man; for at the
  time of the end shall be the vision.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward
  the ground; but he touched me, and set me upright.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And he said:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>
    Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the
    indignation; for at the time appointed the end shall be.
    </span><verse>20</verse><span>The ram which thou sawest having two horns are
    the kings of Media and Persia.
    </span><verse>21</verse><span>And the rough
    goat is the king of Grecia; and the great horn that is between his eyes is
    the first king.
    </span><verse>22</verse><span>Now that being broken, whereas
    four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but
    not in his power.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>23</verse><span>And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are
    come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark
    sentences, shall stand up.
    </span><verse>24</verse><span>And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power; and he shall
    destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practice, and shall destroy
    the mighty and the holy people.
    </span><verse>25</verse><span>And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his
    hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by peace shall
    destroy many; he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but
    he shall be broken without hand.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>26</verse><span>And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is true;
    wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it shall be for many days.</span></block>

  </quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>27</verse><span>And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose up,
  and did the king’s business; and I was astonished at the vision, but
  none understood it.

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the
  Medes, which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans;
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>in the first year of his reign, I Daniel understood by books the number
  of the years, whereof the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet,
  that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and
  supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes;
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>and I prayed unto the LORD my God, and made my confession, and
  said:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>
    O Lord, the great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant and mercy to them
    that love him, and to them that keep his commandments;
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>we have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and
    have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts
    and from thy judgments;
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>neither have we
    hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, which spake in thy name to our
    kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>7</verse><span>O Lord, righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion of
    faces, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of
    Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that are far off,
    through all the countries whither thou hast driven them, because of
    their trespass that they have trespassed against thee.
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our
    princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against thee.
    </span><verse>9</verse><span>To the LORD our God belong mercies and forgivenesses, though we have
    rebelled against him;
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>neither have we obeyed the voice of the LORD our God, to walk in his
    laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets.
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even by departing, that they
    might not obey thy voice; therefore the curse is poured upon us, and the
    oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God, because we
    have sinned against him.
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us, and against
    our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil; for under
    the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jerusalem.
    </span><verse>13</verse><span>As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come upon us;
    yet made we not our prayer before the LORD our God, that we might turn
    from our iniquities, and understand thy truth.
    </span><verse>14</verse><span>Therefore hath the LORD watched upon the evil, and brought it upon us;
    for the LORD our God is righteous in all his works which he doeth; for
    we obeyed not his voice.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>15</verse><span>And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth out of the
    land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten thee renown, as at
    this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly.
    </span><verse>16</verse><span>O Lord, according to all thy righteousness, I beseech thee, let thine
    anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy
    mountain; because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers,
    Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that are about us.
    </span><verse>17</verse><span>Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant, and his
    supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is
    desolate, for the LORD’s sake.
    </span><verse>18</verse><span>O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our
    desolations, and the city which is called by thy name; for we do not
    present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses, but for
    thy great mercies.
    </span><verse>19</verse><span>O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for
    thine own sake, O my God; for thy city and thy people are called by thy

    O Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding.

  Vision of a mighty man
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>10
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed unto
  Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing was true, but
  the time appointed was long; and he understood the thing and had
  understanding of the vision.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth,
  neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were
  fulfilled.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the
  side of the great river, which is Hiddekel;
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>then I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man
  clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz;
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>his body also was like the beryl and his face as the appearance of
  lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like
  in color to polished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of
  a multitude.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>And I Daniel alone saw the vision; for the men that were with me saw
  not the vision; but a great quaking fell upon them, so that they fled to
  hide themselves.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there
  remained no strength in me; for my comeliness was turned in me into
  corruption, and I retained no strength.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>Yet heard I the voice of his words; and when I heard the voice of his
  words, then was I in a deep sleep on my face, and my face toward the
  ground.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>And, behold, a hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and upon the
  palms of my hands.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And said unto me, “O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand the
  words that I speak unto thee, and stand upright; for unto thee am I now
  sent.” And when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>Then said he unto me:</span><quote><span>
   Fear not, Daniel; for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart
   to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy God, thy words were
   heard, and I am come for thy words.
   </span><verse>13</verse><span>But the
   prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days; but, lo,
   Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there
   with the kings of Persia.
   </span><verse>14</verse><span>Now I am come to make
   thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days; for yet
   the vision is for many days.

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And when he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face toward the
  ground, and I became dumb.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And, behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men touched my
  lips; then I opened my mouth, and spake, and said unto him that stood
  before me:</span><quote><span>
   O my lord, by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I have
   retained no strength.
   </span><verse>17</verse><span>For how can the servant
   of this my lord talk with this my lord? For as for me, straightway there
   remained no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>Then there came again and touched me, one like the appearance of a man,
  and he strengthened me,
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>and said, “O man greatly beloved, fear not; peace be unto thee; be
  strong, yea, be strong.” And when he had spoken unto me, I was
  strengthened, and said, “Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened
  me.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>Then said he, “Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee? And now will I
  return to fight with the prince of Persia; and when I am gone forth, lo,
  the prince of Grecia shall come.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>But I will show thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth; and

  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be

  he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion shall be a
  great dominion.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for the
  king’s daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make
  an agreement; but she shall not retain the power of the arm; neither
  shall he stand, nor his arm; but she shall be given up, and they that
  brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in

  </span><verse>7</verse><span>But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his estate which
  shall come with an army, and shall enter into the fortress of the king
  of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail;
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>and shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with their
  princes, and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold; and he
  shall continue more years than the king of the north.

  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And the king of the south shall be moved with choler, and shall come
  forth and fight with him, even with the king of the north; and he shall
  set forth a great multitude; but the multitude shall be given into his
  hand.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And when he hath taken away the multitude, his heart shall be lifted
  up; and he shall cast down many ten thousands; but he shall not be
  strengthened by it.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude
  greater than the former, and shall certainly come after certain years
  with a great army and with much riches.

  <verse>14</verse><span>And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the

  most fenced cities; and the arms of the south shall not withstand,
  neither his chosen people, neither shall there be any strength to
  withstand.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will, and
  none shall stand before him; and he shall stand in the glorious land,
  which by his hand shall be consumed.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole
  kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do; and he shall give
  him the daughter of women, corrupting her; but she shall not stand on
  his side, neither be for him.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall take many;
  but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him
  to cease; without his own reproach he shall cause it to turn upon him.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land; but he
  shall stumble and fall, and not be found.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory of the
  kingdom; but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger,
  nor in battle.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they shall not
  give the honor of the kingdom; but he shall come in peaceably, and
  obtain the kingdom by flatteries.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before him,
  and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant.
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully; for he
  shall come up, and shall become strong with a small people.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the province;
  and he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers’
  fathers; he shall scatter among them the prey, and spoil, and riches;
  yea, and he shall forecast his devices against the strongholds, even for
  a time.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the
  south with a great army; and the king of the south shall be stirred up
  to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand; for
  they shall forecast devices against him.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>Yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy him, and
  his army shall overflow; and many shall fall down slain.
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>And both these kings’ hearts shall be to do mischief, and they shall
  speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper; for yet the end shall
  be at the time appointed.
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his heart
  shall be against the holy covenant; and he shall do exploits, and return
  to his own land.

  </span><verse>37</verse><span>Neither shall he regard the God of his
  fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god; for he shall magnify
  himself above all.
  </span><verse>38</verse><span>But in his estate shall he
  honor the God of forces; and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he
  honor with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant

  <verse>1</verse><span>And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which
  standeth for the children of thy people; and there shall be a time of
  trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same
  time; and at that time thy people shall be delivered, everyone that
  shall be found written in the book.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some
  to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament;
  and they that turn many to righteousness, as the stars forever and ever.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book even to the
  time of the end; many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be
  increased.

  <verse>5</verse><span>Then I Daniel looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the one on
  this side of the bank of the river, and the other on that side of the
  bank of the river.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And one said to the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of
  the river, “How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?”
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the
  river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and
  sware by him that liveth forever, that it shall be for a time, times,
  and a half; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of
  the holy people, all these things shall be finished.

  <verse>8</verse><span>And I heard, but I understood not; then said I, “O my Lord, what shall
  be the end of these things?”
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>And he said:</span><quote><span>
   Go thy way, Daniel; for the words are closed up and sealed till the time
   of the end.
   </span><verse>10</verse><span>Many shall be purified, and made
   white, and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly; and none of the wicked
   shall understand; but the wise shall understand.
   </span><verse>11</verse><span>And from the time that the daily sacrifice
   shall be taken away, and the abomination that maketh desolate set up,
   there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days.
   </span><verse>12</verse><span>Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the
   thousand three hundred and five and thirty days.
   </span><verse>13</verse><span>But go thou thy way till the end be; for thou
   shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at the end of the days.
