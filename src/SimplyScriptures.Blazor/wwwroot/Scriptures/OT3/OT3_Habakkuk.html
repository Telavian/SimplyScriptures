  Habakkuk’s complaint

  <verse>2</verse><span>O Lord, how long shall I cry,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and thou wilt not hear!</span></indent><span>
  Even cry out unto thee of violence,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and thou wilt not save!</span></indent>
  <verse>3</verse><span>Why dost thou show me iniquity,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and cause me to behold grievances?</span></indent><span>
  For spoiling and violence are before me;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and there are that raise up strife and contention.</span></indent>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Therefore the law is slacked,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and judgment doth never go forth;</span></indent><span>
  for the wicked doth compass about the righteous;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.</span></indent>

  The Lord’s answer
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>Behold ye among the heathen,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and regard, and wonder marvelously;</span></indent><span>
  for I will work a work in your days,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>which ye will not believe,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>though it be told you.</span></indent>
  <verse>6</verse><span>For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>that bitter and hasty nation,</span></indent><span>
  which shall march through the breadth of the land,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>to possess the dwelling-places that are not theirs.</span></indent>
  <verse>7</verse><span>They are terrible and dreadful;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves.</span></indent>
  <verse>8</verse><span>Their horses also are swifter than the leopards,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and are more fierce than the evening wolves;</span></indent><span>
  and their horsemen shall spread themselves,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and their horsemen shall come from far;</span></indent><span>
  they shall fly as the eagle that hasteth to eat.</span><break></break>
  <indent>
   <verse>9</verse><span>They shall come all for violence;</span></indent><span>
  their faces shall sup up as the east wind,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and they shall gather the captivity as the sand.</span></indent>
  <verse>10</verse><span>And they shall scoff at the kings,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the princes shall be a scorn unto them;</span></indent><span>
  they shall deride every strong hold;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>for they shall heap dust, and take it.</span></indent>
  <verse>11</verse><span>Then shall his mind change, and he shall pass over,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and offend, imputing this his power unto his god.</span></indent>

  Habakkuk’s second complaint
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>Art thou not from everlasting,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>O Lord my God, mine Holy One? We shall not die.</span></indent><span>
  O Lord, thou has ordained them for judgment;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction.</span></indent>
  <verse>13</verse><span>Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and canst not look on iniquity;</span></indent><span>
  wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and holdest thy tongue</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than he?</span></indent>
  <verse>14</verse><span>And maketh men as the fishes of the sea,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them?</span></indent>
  <verse>15</verse><span>They take up all of them with the angle,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>they catch them in their net,</span></indent><span>
  and gather them in their drag;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>therefore they rejoice and are glad.</span></indent>
  <verse>16</verse><span>Therefore they sacrifice unto their net,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and burn incense unto their drag;</span></indent><span>
  because by them their portion is fat,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and their meat plenteous.</span></indent>
  <verse>17</verse><span>Shall they therefore empty their net,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and not spare continually to slay the nations?</span></indent>

  <verse>1</verse><span>I will stand upon my watch,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and set me upon the tower,</span></indent><span>
  and will watch to see what he will say unto me,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and what I shall answer when I am reproved.</span></indent>

  The Lord’s answer
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>And the LORD answered me, and said:</span><break></break>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  Write the vision,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and make it plain upon tables,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>that he may run that readeth it.</span></indent>
  <verse>3</verse><span>For the vision is yet for an appointed time,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>but at the end it shall speak, and not lie;</span></indent><span>
  though it tarry, wait for it;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>because it will surely come, it will not tarry.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Behold, his soul, which is liften up is not upright in him;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>but the just shall live by his faith.</span></indent>
  <verse>5</verse><span>Yea also, because he transgresseth by wine</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he is a proud man, neither keepeth at home,</span></indent><span>
  who enlargeth his desire as hell,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and is as death, and cannot be satisfied,</span></indent><span>
  but gathereth unto him all nations,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and heapeth unto him all people;</span></indent>
  <verse>6</verse><span>shall not all these take up a parable against him,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and a taunting proverb against him,</span></indent><span>
  and say, ‘Woe to him that increaseth that which is not his!</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>How long? And to him that ladeth himself with thick clay!’</span></indent>
  <verse>7</verse><span>Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and awake that shall vex thee,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and thou shalt be for booties unto them?</span></indent>
  <verse>8</verse><span>Because thou hast spoiled many nations,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee;</span></indent><span>
  because of men’s blood,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>that he may set his nest on high,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>that he may be delivered from the power of evil!</span></indent>
  <verse>10</verse><span>Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many people,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and hast sinned against thy soul.</span></indent>
  <verse>11</verse><span>For the stone shall cry out of the wall,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and establisheth a city by iniquity.</span></indent>
  <verse>13</verse><span>Behold, is it not of the LORD of hosts that the people shall labor in the very fire,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity?</span></indent>
  <verse>14</verse><span>For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>as the waters cover the sea.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>Woe unto him that giveth his neighbor drink,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>that puttest thy bottle to him, and makest him drunken also,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>that thou mayest look on their nakedness!</span></indent>
  <verse>16</verse><span>Thou art filled with shame for glory;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>drink thou also, and let thy foreskin be uncovered;</span></indent><span>
  the cup of the LORD’s right hand shall be turned unto thee,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and shameful spewing shall be on thy glory.</span></indent>
  <verse>17</verse><span>For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the spoil of beasts, which made them afraid, because of men’s blood,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.</span></indent>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven it;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the molten image, and a teacher of lies,</span></indent><span>
  that the maker of his work trusteth therein,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>to make dumb idols?</span></indent>
  <verse>19</verse><span>Woe unto him that saith to the wood, ‘Awake;’</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>to the dumb stone, ‘Arise,’</span></indent><span>
  It shall teach?</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>Behold, it is laid over with gold and silver,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and there is no breadth at all in the midst of it.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>But the LORD is in his holy temple;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>let all the earth keep silence before him.</span></indent>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth.</span><break></break>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>O Lord, I have heard thy speech,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and was afraid, O Lord.</span></indent><span>
  Revive thy work in the midst of the years,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>in the midst of the years make known;</span></indent>
  <indent><span>in wrath remember mercy.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>God came from Teman,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah.</span></indent><span>
  His glory covered the heavens,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the earth was full of his praise.</span></indent>
  <verse>4</verse><span>And his brightness was as the light;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he had horns coming out of his hand;</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and there was the hiding of his power.</span></indent>
  <verse>5</verse><span>Before him went the pestilence,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and burning coals went forth at his feet.</span></indent>
  <verse>6</verse><span>He stood, and measured the earth;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he beheld, and drove asunder the nations;</span></indent><span>
  and the everlasting mountains were scattered,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the perpetual hills did bow;</span></indent>
  <indent><span>his ways are everlasting.</span></indent>
  <verse>7</verse><span>I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>Was the LORD displeased against the rivers?</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>Was thine anger against the rivers?</span></indent>
  <indent><span>Was thy wrath against the sea,</span></indent><span>
  that thou didst ride upon thine horses</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and thy chariots of salvation?</span></indent>
  <verse>9</verse><span>Thy bow was made quite naked,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>according to the oaths of the tribes, even thy word. Selah.</span></indent><span>
  Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.</span><break></break>
  <indent>
   <verse>10</verse><span>The mountains saw thee, and they trembled.</span></indent><span>
  The overflowing of the water passed by;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the deep uttered his voice,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and lifted up his hands on high.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>The sun and moon stood still in their habitation;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>at the light of thine arrows they went,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and at the shining of thy glittering spear.</span></indent>
  <verse>12</verse><span>Thou didst march through the land in indignation,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>thou didst thresh the heathen in anger.</span></indent>
  <verse>13</verse><span>Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>even for salvation with thine anointed;</span></indent><span>
  thou woundedest the head out of the house of the wicked,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>by discovering the foundation unto the neck. Selah.</span></indent>
  <verse>14</verse><span>Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me;</span></indent>
  <indent><span>their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly.</span></indent>
  <verse>15</verse><span>Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>through the heap of great waters.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>When I heard, my belly trembled;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>my lips quivered at the voice;</span></indent><span>
  rottenness entered into my bones,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and I trembled in myself,</span></indent><span>
  that I might rest in the day of trouble;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>when he cometh up unto the people,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>he will invade them with his troops.</span></indent>
  <verse>17</verse><span>Although the fig tree shall not blossom,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>neither shall fruit be in the vines;</span></indent><span>
  the labor of the olive shall fail,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the fields shall yield no meat;</span></indent><span>
  the flock shall be cut off from the fold,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and there shall be no herd in the stalls;</span></indent>
  <verse>18</verse><span>yet I will rejoice in the LORD,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>I will joy in the God of my salvation.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>The LORD God is my strength,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and he will make my feet like hinds’ feet,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and he will make me to walk upon mine high places.</span></indent>
