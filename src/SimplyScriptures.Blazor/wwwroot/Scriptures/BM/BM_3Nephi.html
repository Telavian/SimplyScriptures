    And Helaman was the son of Helaman, who was the son of Alma, who was the son of Alma, being
    a descendant of Nephi who was the son of Lehi, who came out of Jerusalem in the first year of the
    reign of Zedekiah, the king of Judah.

  <chapter>1</chapter>

  <block>
   <verse>1</verse><span>Now it came to pass that the ninety and first year had passed away
   and it was six hundred years from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem;
   and it was in the year that Lachoneus was the chief judge and the
   governor over the land.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>2</verse><span>And Nephi, the son of Helaman, had departed out of the land of
   Zarahemla, giving charge unto his son Nephi, who was his eldest son,
   concerning the plates of brass, and all the records which had been
   kept, and all those things which had been kept sacred from the
   departure of Lehi out of Jerusalem.
   </span><verse>3</verse><span>Then he departed out of the land, and whither he went, no man
   knoweth; and his son Nephi did keep the records in his stead, yea,
   the record of this people.

    THE SIGN OF CHRIST’S COMING
</span></blockheading>

  <block>
   <verse>4</verse><span>And it came to pass that in the commencement of the ninety and
   second year, behold, the prophecies of the prophets began to be
   fulfilled more fully; for there began to be greater signs and
   greater miracles wrought among the people.
   </span><verse>5</verse><span>But there were some who began to say that the time was past for the
   words to be fulfilled, which were spoken by Samuel, the Lamanite.
   </span><verse>6</verse><span>And they began to rejoice over their brethren, saying:</span><quote><span>
    Behold the time is past, and the words of Samuel are not fulfilled;
    therefore, your joy and your faith concerning this thing has been
    vain.
   </span></quote>
  </block>

  <block>
   <verse>7</verse><span>And it came to pass that they did make a great uproar throughout
   the land. And the people who believed began to be very sorrowful,
   lest by any means those things which had been spoken might not come
   to pass.
   </span><verse>8</verse><span>But behold, they did watch steadfastly for that day and that night
   and that day which should be as one day as if there were no night,
   that they might know that their faith had not been vain.
   </span><verse>9</verse><span>Now it came to pass that there was a day set apart by the
   unbelievers, that all those who believed in those traditions should
   be put to death except the sign should come to pass which had been
   given by Samuel the prophet.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>10</verse><span>Now it came to pass that when Nephi, the son of Nephi, saw this
   wickedness of his people, his heart was exceedingly sorrowful.
   </span><verse>11</verse><span>And it came to pass that he went out and bowed himself down upon
   the earth and cried mightily to his God in behalf of his people,
   yea, those who were about to be destroyed because of their faith in
   the tradition of their fathers.
   </span><verse>12</verse><span>And it came to pass that he cried mightily unto the Lord all that
   day.
  </span></block>

  <block><span>
   And behold, the voice of the Lord came unto him, saying:
   </span><quote>
    <block>
     <verse>13</verse><span>Lift up your head and be of good cheer; for behold, the time is at
     hand, and on this night shall the sign be given, and on the morrow
     come I into the world, to show unto the world that I will fulfil all
     that which I have caused to be spoken by the mouth of my holy
     prophets.
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>Behold, I come unto my own, to fulfil all things which I have made
     known unto the children of men from the foundation of the world, and
     to do the will both of the Father and of the Son—of the Father
     because of me, and of the
     Son because of my flesh. And behold, the time is at hand, and this
     night shall the sign be given.
    </span></block>

   </quote>
  </block>

  <block>
   <verse>15</verse><span>And it came to pass that the words which came unto Nephi were
   fulfilled, according as they had been spoken; for behold, at the
   going down of the sun there was no darkness; and the people began to
   be astonished because there was no darkness when the night
   came.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>16</verse><span>And there were many, who had not believed the words of the
   prophets, who fell to the earth and became as if they were dead, for
   they knew that the great plan of destruction which they had laid for
   those who believed in the words of the prophets had been frustrated;
   for the sign which had been given was already at hand.
   </span><verse>17</verse><span>And they began to know that the Son of God must shortly appear;
   yea, in fine, all the people upon the face of the whole earth from
   the west to the east, both in the land north and in the land south,
   were so exceedingly astonished that they fell to the earth.
   </span><verse>18</verse><span>For they knew that the prophets had testified of these things for
   many years, and that the sign which had been given was already at
   hand; and they began to fear because of their iniquity and their
   unbelief.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>19</verse><span>And it came to pass that there was no darkness in all that night,
   but it was as light as though it was mid-day. And it came to pass
   that the sun did rise in the morning again, according to its proper
   order; and they knew that it was the day that the Lord should be
   born, because of the sign which had been given.
   </span><verse>20</verse><span>And it had come to pass, yea, all things, every whit, according to
   the words of the prophets.
   </span><verse>21</verse><span>And it came to pass also that a new star did appear, according to
   the word.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>22</verse><span>And it came to pass that from this time forth there began to be
   lyings sent forth among the people, by Satan, to harden their
   hearts, to the intent that they might not believe in those signs and
   wonders which they had seen; but notwithstanding these lyings and
   deceivings the more part of the people did believe, and were
   converted unto the Lord.
   </span><verse>23</verse><span>And it came to pass that Nephi went forth among the people, and
   also many others, baptizing unto repentance, in the which there was
   a great remission of sins.
  </span></block>

  <block><span>
   And thus the people began again to have peace in the land.
   </span><verse>24</verse><span>And there were no contentions, save it were
   a few that began to preach, endeavoring to prove by the scriptures
   that it was no more expedient to observe the law of Moses. Now in this
   thing they did err, having not understood the scriptures.
   </span><verse>25</verse><span>But it came to pass that they soon became
   converted, and were convinced of the error which they were in, for it
   was made known unto them that the law was not yet fulfilled, and that
   it must be fulfilled in every whit; yea, the word came unto them that
   it must be fulfilled; yea, that one jot or tittle should not pass away
   till it should all be fulfilled; therefore in this same year were they
   brought to a knowledge of their error and did confess their faults.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>26</verse><span>And thus the ninety and second year did pass away, bringing glad
   tidings unto the people because of the signs which did come to pass,
   according to the words of the prophecy of all the holy
   prophets.

   GADIANTON ROBBERS
  </span></subsectionheading>
  <block>
   <verse>27</verse><span>And it came to pass that the ninety and third year did also pass
   away in peace, save it were for the Gadianton robbers, who dwelt
   upon the mountains, who did infest the land; for so strong were
   their holds and their secret places that the people could not
   overpower them; therefore they did commit many murders, and did do
   much slaughter among the people.
   </span><verse>28</verse><span>And it came to pass that in the ninety and fourth year they began
   to increase in a great degree, because there were many dissenters of the Nephites
   who did flee unto them, which did cause much sorrow unto those
   Nephites who did remain in the land.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>29</verse><span>And there was also a cause of much sorrow among the Lamanites; for
   behold, they had many children who did grow up and began to wax
   strong in years, that they became for themselves, and were led away
   by some who were Zoramites, by their lyings and their flattering
   words, to join those Gadianton robbers.
   </span><verse>30</verse><span>And thus were the Lamanites afflicted also, and began to decrease
   as to their faith and righteousness, because of the wickedness of
   the rising generation.
  </span></block>

   Wickedness

  <chapter>2
  </chapter>

  <block>
   <verse>1</verse><span>And it came to pass that thus passed away the ninety and fifth year
   also, and the people began to forget those signs and wonders which
   they had heard, and began to be less and less astonished at a sign
   or a wonder from heaven, insomuch that they began to be hard in
   their hearts, and blind in their minds, and began to disbelieve all
   which they had heard and seen—</span><verse>2</verse><span>imagining up some vain thing in their hearts, that it was wrought
   by men and by the power of the devil, to lead away and deceive the
   hearts of the people; and thus did Satan get possession of the
   hearts of the people again, insomuch that he did blind their eyes
   and lead them away to believe that the doctrine of Christ was a
   foolish and a vain thing.
   </span><verse>3</verse><span>And it came to pass that the people began to wax strong in
   wickedness and abominations; and they did not believe that there
   should be any more signs or wonders given; and Satan did go about,
   leading away the hearts of the people, tempting them and causing
   them that they should do great wickedness in the land.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>4</verse><span>And thus did pass away the ninety and sixth year; and also the
   ninety and seventh year; and also the ninety and eighth year; and
   also the ninety and ninth year;
   </span><verse>5</verse><span>and also a hundred years had passed away since the days of Mosiah,
   who was king over the people of the Nephites.
   </span><verse>6</verse><span>And six hundred and nine years had passed away since Lehi left
   Jerusalem.
   </span><verse>7</verse><span>And nine years had passed away from the time when the sign was
   given, which was spoken of by the prophets, that Christ should come
   into the world.
   </span><verse>8</verse><span>Now the Nephites began to reckon their time from this period when
   the sign was given, or from the coming of Christ; therefore, nine
   years had passed away.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>9</verse><span>And Nephi, who was the father of Nephi, who had the charge of the
   records, did not return to the land of Zarahemla, and could nowhere
   be found in all the land.
   </span><verse>10</verse><span>And it came to pass that the people did still remain in wickedness,
   notwithstanding the much preaching and prophesying which was sent
   among them; and thus passed away the tenth year also; and the
   eleventh year also passed away in iniquity.
  </span></block>

  <blockheading><span>
   GADIANTON WAR
  </span></blockheading>
  <block>
   <verse>11</verse><span>And it came to pass in the thirteenth year there began to be wars
   and contentions throughout all the land; for the Gadianton robbers
   had become so numerous, and did slay so many of the people, and did
   lay waste so many cities, and did spread so much death and carnage
   throughout the land, that it became expedient that all the people,
   both the Nephites and the Lamanites, should take up arms against
   them.
   </span><verse>12</verse><span>Therefore, all the Lamanites who had become converted unto the Lord
   did unite with their brethren, the Nephites, and were compelled, for
   the safety of their lives and their women and their children, to
   take up arms against those Gadianton robbers, yea, and also to
   maintain their rights, and the privileges of their church and of
   their worship, and their freedom and their liberty.
   </span><verse>13</verse><span>And it came to pass that before this thirteenth year had passed
   away the Nephites
   were threatened with utter destruction because of this war, which
   had become exceedingly sore.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>14</verse><span>And it came to pass that those Lamanites who had united with the
   Nephites were numbered among the Nephites;
   </span><verse>15</verse><span>and their curse was taken from them, and their skin became white
   like unto the Nephites;
   </span><verse>16</verse><span>and their young men and their daughters became exceedingly fair,
   and they were numbered among the Nephites, and were called Nephites.
   And thus ended the thirteenth year.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>17</verse><span>And it came to pass in the commencement of the fourteenth year, the
   war between the robbers and the people of Nephi did continue and did
   become exceedingly sore; nevertheless, the people of Nephi did gain
   some advantage of the robbers, insomuch that they did drive them
   back out of their lands into the mountains and into their secret
   places.
   </span><verse>18</verse><span>And thus ended the fourteenth year.
  </span></block>

  <block><span>
   And in the fifteenth year they did come forth against the people of
   Nephi; and because of the wickedness of the people of Nephi, and their
   many contentions and dissensions, the Gadianton robbers did gain many
   advantages over them.
   </span><verse>19</verse><span>And thus ended the
   fifteenth year, and thus were the people in a state of many
   afflictions; and the sword of destruction did hang over them, insomuch
   that they were about to be smitten down by it, and this because of
   their iniquity.

  <chapter>3
  </chapter>

  <block>
   <verse>1</verse><span>And now it came to pass that in the sixteenth year from the coming
   of Christ, Lachoneus, the governor of the land, received an epistle
   from the leader and the governor of this band of robbers; and these
   were the words which were written, saying:
   </span><quote>
    <block>
     <verse>2</verse><span>Lachoneus, most noble and chief governor of the land,</span></block>

    <block><span>
     Behold, I write this epistle unto you, and do give unto you
     exceedingly great praise because of your firmness, and also the
     firmness of your people, in maintaining that which ye suppose to be
     your right and liberty; yea, ye do stand well, as if ye were supported
     by the hand of a god, in the defence of your liberty, and your
     property, and your country, or that which ye do call so.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>3</verse><span>And it seemeth a pity unto me, most noble Lachoneus, that ye should
     be so foolish and vain as to suppose that ye can stand against so
     many brave men who are at my command, who do now at this time stand
     in their arms, and do await with great anxiety for the word, “Go
     down upon the Nephites and destroy them.”
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>And I, knowing of their unconquerable spirit, having proved them in
     the field of battle, and knowing of their everlasting hatred towards
     you because of the many wrongs which ye have done unto them,
     therefore if they should come down against you they would visit you
     with utter destruction.</span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>5</verse><span>Therefore I have written this epistle, sealing it with mine own
     hand, feeling for your welfare, because of your firmness in that
     which ye believe to be right, and your noble spirit in the field of
     battle.
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>Therefore I write unto you, desiring that ye would yield up unto
     this my people, your cities, your lands, and your possessions,
     rather than that they should visit you with the sword and that
     destruction should come upon you.
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>Or in other words, yield yourselves up unto us, and unite with us
     and become acquainted with our secret works, and become our brethren
     that ye may be like unto us—not our slaves, but our brethren and
     partners of all our substance.
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>And behold, I swear unto you, if ye will do this, with an oath, ye
     shall not be destroyed.</span></block>

    <block><span>
     But if ye will not do this, I swear unto you with an oath, that on the
     morrow month I will command that my armies shall come down against
     you, and they shall not stay their hand and shall spare not, but shall
     slay you, and shall let fall the sword upon you even until ye shall
     become extinct.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>9</verse><span>And behold, I am Giddianhi; and I am the governor of this the
     secret society of Gadianton; which society and the works thereof I
     know to be good; and they are of ancient date and they have been
     handed down unto us.
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>And I write this epistle unto you, Lachoneus, and I hope that ye
     will deliver up your lands and your possessions, without the
     shedding of blood, that this my people may recover their rights and
     government, who have dissented away from you because of your
     wickedness in retaining from them their rights of government, and
     except ye do this, I will avenge their wrongs.

  <block>
   <verse>11</verse><span>And now it came to pass when Lachoneus received this epistle he was
   exceedingly astonished, because of the boldness of Giddianhi
   demanding the possession of the land of the Nephites, and also of
   threatening the people and avenging the wrongs of those that had
   received no wrong, save it were they had wronged themselves by
   dissenting away unto those wicked and abominable robbers.

  <block>
   <verse>12</verse><span>Now behold, this Lachoneus, the governor, was a just man, and could
   not be frightened by the demands and the threatenings of a robber;
   therefore he did not hearken to the epistle of Giddianhi, the
   governor of the robbers, but he did cause that his people should cry
   unto the Lord for strength against the time that the robbers should
   come down against them.
   </span><verse>13</verse><span>Yea, he sent a proclamation among all the people, that they should
   gather together their women, and their children, their flocks and
   their herds, and all their substance, save it were their land, unto
   one place.
   </span><verse>14</verse><span>And he caused that fortifications should be built round about them,
   and the strength thereof should be exceedingly great.
  </span></block>

  <block><span>
   And he caused that armies, both of the Nephites and of the Lamanites,
   or of all them who were numbered among the Nephites, should be placed
   as guards round about to watch them, and to guard them from the
   robbers day and night.
   </span><verse>15</verse><span>Yea, he said unto
   them:
   </span><quote><span>
    As the Lord liveth, except ye repent of all your iniquities, and cry

    those Gadianton robbers.

  <block>
   <verse>16</verse><span>And so great and marvelous were the words and prophecies of
   Lachoneus that they did cause fear to come upon all the people; and
   they did exert themselves in their might to do according to the
   words of Lachoneus.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>17</verse><span>And it came to pass that Lachoneus did appoint chief captains over
   all the armies of the Nephites, to command them at the time that the
   robbers should come down out of the wilderness against them.
   </span><verse>18</verse><span>Now the chiefest among all the chief captains and the great
   commander of all the armies of the Nephites was appointed, and his
   name was Gidgiddoni.
   </span><verse>19</verse><span>Now it was the custom among all the Nephites to appoint for their
   chief captains, (save it were in their times of wickedness) some one
   that had the spirit of revelation and also prophecy; therefore, this
   Gidgiddoni was a great prophet among them, as also was the chief
   judge.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>20</verse><span>Now the people said unto Gidgiddoni:</span><quote><span>
    Pray unto the Lord, and let us go up upon the mountains and into the
    wilderness, that we may fall upon the robbers and destroy them in
    their own lands.
   </span></quote>
  </block>

  <block>
   <verse>21</verse><span>But Gidgiddoni saith unto them:</span><quote><span>
    The Lord forbid; for if we should go up against them the Lord would
    deliver us into their hands; therefore we will prepare ourselves in
    the center of our lands, and we will gather all our armies together,
    and we will not go against them, but we will wait till they shall come
    against us; therefore as the Lord liveth, if we do this he will
    deliver them into our hands.
   </span></quote>
  </block>

  <block>
   <verse>22</verse><span>And it came to pass in the seventeenth year, in the latter end of
   the year, the proclamation of Lachoneus had gone forth throughout
   all the face of the land, and they had taken their horses, and their
   chariots, and their cattle, and all their flocks, and their herds,
   and their grain, and all their substance, and did march forth by
   thousands and by tens of thousands, until they had all gone forth to
   the place which had been appointed that they should gather
   themselves together, to defend themselves against their
   enemies.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>23</verse><span>And the land which was appointed was the land of Zarahemla, and the
   land which was between the land of Zarahemla and the land Bountiful,
   yea, to the line which was between the land Bountiful and the land
   Desolation.
   </span><verse>24</verse><span>And there were a great many thousand people who were called
   Nephites, who did gather themselves together in this land. Now
   Lachoneus did cause that they should gather themselves together in
   the land southward, because of the great curse which was upon the
   land northward.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>25</verse><span>And they did fortify themselves against their enemies; and they did
   dwell in one land, and in one body, and they did fear the words
   which had been spoken by Lachoneus, insomuch that they did repent of
   all their sins; and they did put up their prayers unto the Lord
   their God, that he would deliver them in the time that their enemies
   should come down against them to battle.
   </span><verse>26</verse><span>And they were exceedingly sorrowful because of their enemies. And
   Gidgiddoni did cause that they should make weapons of war of every
   kind, and they should be strong with armor, and with shields, and
   with bucklers, after the manner of his instruction.

   GIDDIANHI ATTACKS

  <chapter>4
  </chapter>

  <block>
   <verse>1</verse><span>And it came to pass that in the latter end of the eighteenth year
   those armies of robbers had prepared for battle, and began to come
   down and to sally forth from the hills, and out of the mountains,
   and the wilderness, and their strongholds, and their secret places,
   and began to take possession of the lands, both which were in the
   land south and which were in the land north, and began to take
   possession of all the lands which had been deserted by the Nephites,
   and the cities which had been left desolate.
   </span><verse>2</verse><span>But behold, there were no wild beasts nor game in those lands which
   had been deserted by the Nephites, and there was no game for the
   robbers save it were in the wilderness.
   </span><verse>3</verse><span>And the robbers could not exist save it were in the wilderness, for
   the want of food.
  </span></block>

  <block><span>
   For the Nephites had left their lands desolate, and had gathered their
   flocks and their herds and all their substance, and they were in one
   body.
   </span><verse>4</verse><span>Therefore, there was no chance for the
   robbers to plunder and to obtain food, save it were to come up in open
   battle against the Nephites; and the Nephites being in one body, and
   having so great a number, and having reserved for themselves
   provisions, and horses and cattle, and flocks of every kind, that they
   might subsist for the space of seven years, in the which time they did
   hope to destroy the robbers from off the face of the land; and thus
   the eighteenth year did pass away.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>5</verse><span>And it came to pass that in the nineteenth year Giddianhi found
   that it was expedient that he should go up to battle against the
   Nephites, for there was no way that they could subsist save it were
   to plunder and rob and murder.
   </span><verse>6</verse><span>And they durst not spread themselves
   upon the face of the land insomuch that they could raise grain, lest
   the Nephites should come upon them and slay them; therefore Giddianhi
   gave commandment unto his armies that in this year they should go up
   to battle against the Nephites.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>7</verse><span>And it came to pass that they did come up to battle; and it was in
   the sixth month; and behold, great and terrible was the day that
   they did come up to battle; and they were girded about after the
   manner of robbers; and they had a lamb-skin about their loins, and
   they were dyed in blood, and their heads were shorn, and they had
   head-plates upon them; and great and terrible was the appearance of
   the armies of Giddianhi, because of their armor, and because of
   their being dyed in blood.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>8</verse><span>And it came to pass that the armies of the Nephites, when they saw
   the appearance of the army of Giddianhi, had all fallen to the
   earth, and did lift their cries to the Lord their God, that he would
   spare them and deliver them out of the hands of their enemies.
   </span><verse>9</verse><span>And it came to pass that when the armies of Giddianhi saw this they
   began to shout with a loud voice, because of their joy, for they had
   supposed that the Nephites had fallen with fear because of the
   terror of their armies.
   </span><verse>10</verse><span>But in this thing they were disappointed, for the Nephites did not
   fear them; but they did fear their God and did supplicate him for
   protection.
  </span></block>

  <block><span>
   Therefore, when the armies of Giddianhi did rush upon them they were
   prepared to meet them; yea, in the strength of the Lord they did
   receive them.
   </span><verse>11</verse><span>And the battle commenced in
   this the sixth month; and great and terrible was the battle thereof,
   yea, great and terrible was the slaughter thereof, insomuch that there
   never was known so great a slaughter among all the people of Lehi
   since he left Jerusalem.
   </span><verse>12</verse><span>And
   notwithstanding the threatenings and the oaths which Giddianhi had
   made, behold, the Nephites did beat them, insomuch that they did fall
   back from before them.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>13</verse><span>And it came to pass that Gidgiddoni commanded that his armies
   should pursue them as far as the borders of the wilderness, and that
   they should not spare any that should fall into their hands by the
   way; and thus they did pursue them and did slay them, to the borders
   of the wilderness, even until they had fulfilled the commandment of
   Gidgiddoni.
   </span><verse>14</verse><span>And it came to pass that Giddianhi, who had stood and fought with
   boldness, was pursued as he fled; and being weary because of his
   much fighting he was overtaken and slain. And thus was the end of
   Giddianhi the robber.
   </span><verse>15</verse><span>And it came to pass that the armies of the Nephites did return
   again to their place of security.

   Zemnarihah besieges and retreats
  </span></heading>

  <block><span>
   And it came to pass that this nineteenth year did pass away, and the
   robbers did not come again to battle; neither did they come again in
   the twentieth year.
   </span><verse>16</verse><span>And in the twenty and
   first year they did not come up to battle, but they came up on all
   sides to lay siege round about the people of Nephi; for they did
   suppose that if they should cut off the people of Nephi from their
   lands, and should hem them in on every side, and if they should cut
   them off from all their outward privileges, that they could cause them
   to yield themselves up according to their wishes.
   </span><verse>17</verse><span>Now they had appointed unto themselves
   another leader, whose name was Zemnarihah; therefore it was Zemnarihah
   that did cause that this siege should take place.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>18</verse><span>But behold, this was an advantage to the Nephites; for it was
   impossible for the robbers to lay siege sufficiently long to have
   any effect upon the Nephites, because of their much provision which
   they had laid up in store,
   </span><verse>19</verse><span>and because of the scantiness of provisions among the robbers; for
   behold, they had nothing save it were meat for their subsistence,
   which meat they did obtain in the wilderness;
   </span><verse>20</verse><span>and it came to pass that the wild game
   became scarce in the wilderness insomuch that the robbers were about
   to perish with hunger.
   </span><verse>21</verse><span>And the Nephites
   were continually marching out by day and by night, and falling upon
   their armies, and cutting them off by thousands and by tens of
   thousands.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>22</verse><span>And thus it became the desire of the people of Zemnarihah to
   withdraw from their design, because of the great destruction which
   came upon them by night and by day.
   </span><verse>23</verse><span>And it came to pass that Zemnarihah did give command unto his
   people that they should withdraw themselves from the siege, and
   march into the furthermost parts of the land northward.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>24</verse><span>And now, Gidgiddoni being aware of their design, and knowing of
   their weakness because of the want of food, and the great slaughter
   which had been made among them, therefore he did send out his armies
   in the night-time, and did cut off the way of their retreat, and did
   place his armies in the way of their retreat.
   </span><verse>25</verse><span>And this did they do in the night-time, and got on their march
   beyond the robbers, so that on the morrow, when the robbers began
   their march, they were met by the armies of the Nephites both in
   their front and in their rear.
   </span><verse>26</verse><span>And the robbers who were on the south were also cut off in their
   places of retreat. And all these things were done by command of
   Gidgiddoni.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>27</verse><span>And there were many thousands who did yield themselves up prisoners
   unto the Nephites, and the remainder of them were slain.
   </span><verse>28</verse><span>And their leader, Zemnarihah, was taken and hanged upon a tree,
   yea, even upon the top thereof until he was dead. And when they had
   hanged him until he was dead they did fell the tree to the earth,
   and did cry with a loud voice, saying:</span><quote>
    <verse>29</verse><span>May the Lord preserve his people in righteousness and in holiness
    of heart, that they may cause to be felled to the earth all who
    shall seek to slay them because of power and secret combinations,
    even as this man hath been felled to the earth.</span></quote>
  </block>

  <block>
   <verse>30</verse><span>And they did rejoice and cry again with one voice, saying:</span><quote><span>
    May the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob,
    protect this people in righteousness, so long as they shall call on
    the name of their God for protection.
   </span></quote>
  </block>

  <block>
   <verse>31</verse><span>And it came to pass that they did break forth, all as one, in
   singing, and praising their God for the great thing which he had
   done for them, in preserving them from falling into the hands of
   their enemies.
   </span><verse>32</verse><span>Yea, they did cry, “Hosanna to the Most High God.” And they did
   cry, “Blessed be the name of the Lord God Almighty, the Most High
   God.”
   </span><verse>33</verse><span>And their hearts were swollen with joy, unto the gushing out of
   many tears, because of the great goodness of God in delivering them
   out of the hands of their enemies; and they knew it was because of
   their repentance and their humility that they had been delivered
   from an everlasting destruction.

  <block>
   <verse>1</verse><span>And now behold, there was not a living soul among all the people of
   the Nephites who did doubt in the least words of all the holy
   prophets who had spoken; for they knew that it must needs be that
   they must be fulfilled.
   </span><verse>2</verse><span>And they knew that it must be expedient that Christ had come,
   because of the many signs which had been given, according to the
   words of the prophets; and because of the things which had come to
   pass already they knew that it must needs be that all things should
   come to pass according to that which had been spoken.
   </span><verse>3</verse><span>Therefore they did forsake all their sins, and their abominations,
   and their whoredoms, and did serve God with all diligence day and
   night.
   </span><verse>4</verse><span>And now it came to pass that when they had taken all the robbers
   prisoners, insomuch that none did escape who were not slain, they
   did cast their prisoners into prison, and did cause the word of God
   to be preached unto them; and as many as would repent of their sins
   and enter into a covenant that they would murder no more were set at
   liberty.
   </span><verse>5</verse><span>But as many as there were
   who did not enter into a covenant, and who did still continue to have
   those secret murders in their hearts, yea, as many as were found
   breathing out threatenings against their brethren were condemned and
   punished according to the law.
   </span><verse>6</verse><span>And thus they
   did put an end to all those wicked, and secret, and abominable
   combinations, in the which there was so much wickedness, and so many
   murders committed.
   </span><verse>7</verse><span>And thus had the twenty

   <verse>1</verse><span>And now it came to pass that the people of the Nephites did all
   return to their own lands in the twenty and sixth year, every man,
   with his family, his flocks and his herds, his horses and his
   cattle, and all things whatsoever did belong unto them.
   </span><verse>2</verse><span>And it came to pass that they had not eaten up all their
   provisions; therefore they did take with them all that they had not
   devoured, of all their grain of every kind, and their gold, and
   their silver, and all their precious things, and they did return to
   their own lands and their possessions, both on the north and on the
   south, both on the land northward and on the land southward.
   </span><verse>3</verse><span>And they granted unto those robbers who had entered into a covenant
   to keep the peace of the land, who were desirous to remain
   Lamanites, lands, according to their numbers, that they might have,
   with their labors, wherewith to subsist upon; and thus they did
   establish peace in all the land.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>4</verse><span>And they began again to prosper and to wax great; and the twenty
   and sixth and seventh years passed away, and there was great order
   in the land; and they had formed their laws according to equity and
   justice.
   </span><verse>5</verse><span>And now there was nothing in all the land to hinder the people from
   prospering continually, except they should fall into transgression.
   </span><verse>6</verse><span>And now it was Gidgiddoni, and the judge, Lachoneus, and those who
   had been appointed leaders, who had established this great peace in
   the land.

  <block>
   <verse>7</verse><span>And it came to pass that there were many cities built anew, and
   there were many old cities repaired.

   led from city to city, and from land to land, and from place to

   Prosperity and inequality
  </span></heading>

  <block>
   <verse>10</verse><span>But it came to pass in the twenty and ninth year there began to be
   some disputings among the people; and some were lifted up unto pride
   and boastings because of their exceedingly great riches, yea, even
   unto great persecutions;
   </span><verse>11</verse><span>for there were many merchants in the land, and also many lawyers,
   and many officers.
   </span><verse>12</verse><span>And the people began to be distinguished by ranks, according to
   their riches and their chances for learning; yea, some were ignorant
   because of their poverty, and others did receive great learning
   because of their riches.
   </span><verse>13</verse><span>Some were lifted up in pride, and others were exceedingly humble;
   some did return railing for railing, while others would receive
   railing and persecution and all manner of afflictions, and would not
   turn and revile again, but were humble and penitent before
   God.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>14</verse><span>And thus there became a great inequality in all the land, insomuch
   that the church began to be broken up; yea, insomuch that in the
   thirtieth year the church was broken up in all the land save it were
   among a few of the Lamanites who were converted unto the true faith;
   and they would not depart from it, for they were firm, and
   steadfast, and immovable, willing with all diligence to keep the
   commandments of the Lord.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>15</verse><span>Now the cause of this iniquity of the people was this—Satan had
   great power, unto the stirring up of the people to do all manner of
   iniquity, and to the puffing them up with pride, tempting them to
   seek for power, and authority, and riches, and the vain things of
   the world.
   </span><verse>16</verse><span>And thus Satan did lead away the hearts of the people to do all
   manner of iniquity; therefore they had enjoyed peace but a few
   years.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>17</verse><span>And thus, in the commencement of the thirtieth year—the people
   having been delivered up for the space of a long time to be carried
   about by the temptations of the devil whithersoever he desired to
   carry them, and to do whatsoever iniquity he desired they should—and
   thus in the commencement of this, the thirtieth year, they were in a
   state of awful wickedness.
   </span><verse>18</verse><span>Now they did not sin ignorantly, for they knew the will of
   God concerning them, for it had been taught unto them; therefore they did
   wilfully rebel against God.

   <verse>19</verse><span>And now it was in the days of Lachoneus, the son of Lachoneus, for
   Lachoneus did fill the seat of his father and did govern the people
   that year.
   </span><verse>20</verse><span>And there began to be men inspired from heaven and sent forth,
   standing among the people in all the land, preaching and testifying
   boldly of the sins and iniquities of the people, and testifying unto
   them concerning the redemption which the Lord would make for his
   people, or in other words, the resurrection of Christ; and they did
   testify boldly of his death and sufferings.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>21</verse><span>Now there were many of the people who were exceedingly angry
   because of those who testified of these things; and those who were
   angry were chiefly the chief judges, and they who had been high
   priests and lawyers; yea, all those who were lawyers were angry with
   those who testified of these things.
   </span><verse>22</verse><span>Now there was no lawyer nor judge nor high priest that could have
   power to condemn any one to death save their condemnation was signed
   by the governor of the land.
   </span><verse>23</verse><span>Now there were many of those who testified of the things pertaining
   to Christ who testified boldly, who were taken and put to death
   secretly by the judges, that the knowledge of their death came not
   unto the governor of the land until after their death.
   </span><verse>24</verse><span>Now behold, this was contrary to the laws of the land, that any man
   should be put to death except they had power from the governor of
   the land.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>25</verse><span>Therefore a complaint came up unto the land of Zarahemla, to the
   governor of the land, against these judges who had condemned the
   prophets of the Lord unto death, not according to the law.
   </span><verse>26</verse><span>Now it came to pass that they were taken and brought up before the
   judge, to be judged of the crime which they had done, according to
   the law which had been given by the people.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>27</verse><span>Now it came to pass that those judges had many friends and
   kindreds; and the remainder, yea, even almost all the lawyers and
   the high priests, did gather themselves together, and unite with the
   kindreds of those judges who were to be tried according to the law.
   </span><verse>28</verse><span>And they did enter into a covenant one with another, yea, even into
   that covenant which was given by them of old, which covenant was
   given and administered by the devil, to combine against all
   righteousness.
   </span><verse>29</verse><span>Therefore they did combine against the people of the Lord, and
   enter into a covenant to destroy them, and to deliver those who were
   guilty of murder from the grasp of justice, which was about to be
   administered according to the law.
   </span><verse>30</verse><span>And they did set at defiance the law and the rights of their
   country; and they did covenant one with another to destroy the
   governor, and to establish a king over the land, that the land
   should no more be at liberty but should be subject unto kings.

  <block>
   <verse>1</verse><span>Now behold, I will show unto you that they did not establish a king

   Tribal divisions

  <block>
   <verse>2</verse><span>And the people were divided one against another; and they did
   separate one from another into tribes, every man according to his
   family and his kindred and friends; and thus they did destroy the
   government of the land.
   </span><verse>3</verse><span>And every tribe did appoint a chief or a leader over them; and thus
   they became tribes and leaders of tribes.
   </span><verse>4</verse><span>Now behold, there was no man among them save he had much family and
   many kindreds and friends; therefore their tribes became exceedingly
   great.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>5</verse><span>Now all this was done, and there were no wars as yet among them;
   and all this iniquity had come upon the people because they did
   yield themselves unto the power of Satan.
   </span><verse>6</verse><span>And the regulations of the government were destroyed, because of
   the secret combination of the friends and kindreds of those who
   murdered the prophets.
   </span><verse>7</verse><span>And they did cause a great contention in the land, insomuch that
   the more righteous part of the people had nearly all become wicked;
   yea, there were but few righteous men among them.
   </span><verse>8</verse><span>And thus six years had not passed away since the more part of the
   people had turned from their righteousness, like the dog to his
   vomit, or like the sow to her wallowing in the mire.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>9</verse><span>Now this secret combination, which had brought so great iniquity
   upon the people, did gather themselves together, and did place at
   their head a man whom they did call Jacob;
   </span><verse>10</verse><span>and they did call him their king; therefore he became a king over
   this wicked band; and he was one of the chiefest who had given his
   voice against the prophets who testified of Jesus.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>11</verse><span>And it came to pass that they were not so strong in number as the
   tribes of the people, who were united together save it were their
   leaders did establish their laws, every one according to his tribe;
   nevertheless they were enemies; notwithstanding they were not a
   righteous people, yet they were united in the hatred of those who
   had entered into a covenant to destroy the government.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>12</verse><span>Therefore, Jacob seeing that their enemies were more numerous than
   they, he being the king of the band, therefore he commanded his
   people that they should take their flight into the northernmost part
   of the land, and there build up unto themselves a kingdom, until
   they were joined by dissenters, (for he flattered them that there
   would be many dissenters) and they become sufficiently strong to
   contend with the tribes of the people; and they did so.
   </span><verse>13</verse><span>And so speedy was their march that it could not be impeded until
   they had gone forth out of the reach of the people. And thus ended
   the thirtieth year; and thus were the affairs of the people of
   Nephi.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>14</verse><span>And it came to pass in the thirty and first year that they were
   divided into tribes, every man according to his family, kindred and
   friends; nevertheless they had come to an agreement that they would
   not go to war one with another; but they were not united as to their
   laws, and their manner of government, for they were established
   according to the minds of those who were their chiefs and their
   leaders. But they did establish very strict laws that one tribe
   should not trespass against another, insomuch that in some degree
   they had peace in the land; nevertheless, their hearts were turned
   from the Lord their God, and they did stone the prophets and did
   cast them out from among them.

   NEPHI’S MINISTRY
  </span></blockheading>
  <block>
   <verse>15</verse><span>And it came to pass that Nephi—having been visited by angels and
   also the voice of the Lord, therefore having seen angels, and being
   eye-witness, and having had power given unto him that he might know
   concerning the ministry of Christ, and also being eye- witness to
   their quick return from righteousness unto their wickedness and
   abominations;
   </span><verse>16</verse><span>therefore, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts and the
   blindness of their minds—went forth among them in that same year,
   and began to testify, boldly, repentance and remission of sins
   through faith on the Lord Jesus Christ.
   </span><verse>17</verse><span>And he did minister many things unto them; and all of them cannot
   be written, and a part of them would not suffice, therefore they are

   great authority.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>18</verse><span>And it came to pass that they were angry with him, even because he
   had greater power than they, for it were not possible that they
   could disbelieve his words, for so great was his
   faith on the Lord Jesus Christ that angels did minister unto him
   daily.
   </span><verse>19</verse><span>And in the name of Jesus did he cast
   out devils and unclean spirits; and even his brother did he raise from
   the dead, after he had been stoned and suffered death by the people.
   </span><verse>20</verse><span>And the people saw it, and did witness of
   it, and were angry with him because of his power; and he did also do
   many more miracles, in the sight of the people, in the name of Jesus.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>21</verse><span>And it came to pass that the thirty and first year did pass away,
   and there were but few who were converted unto the Lord; but as many
   as were converted did truly signify unto the people that they had
   been visited by the power and Spirit of God, which was in Jesus
   Christ, in whom they believed.
   </span><verse>22</verse><span>And as many as had devils cast out from them, and were healed of
   their sicknesses and their infirmities, did truly manifest unto the
   people that they had been wrought upon by the Spirit of God, and had
   been healed; and they did show forth signs also and did do some
   miracles among the people.
   </span><verse>23</verse><span>Thus passed away the thirty and second year also. And Nephi did cry
   unto the people in the commencement of the thirty and third year;
   and he did preach unto them repentance and remission of sins.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>24</verse><span>Now I would have you to remember also, that there were none who
   were brought unto repentance who were not baptized with water.
   </span><verse>25</verse><span>Therefore, there were ordained of Nephi, men unto this ministry,
   that all such as should come unto them should be baptized with
   water, and this as a witness and a testimony before God, and unto
   the people, that they had repented and received a remission of their
   sins.
   </span><verse>26</verse><span>And there were many in the commencement of this year that were
   baptized unto repentance; and thus the more part of the year did
   pass away.

   <verse>1</verse><span>And now it came to pass that according to our record, and we know
   our record to be true, for behold, it was a just man who did keep
   the record—for he truly did many miracles in the name of Jesus; and
   there was not any man who could do a miracle in the name of Jesus
   save he were cleansed every whit from his iniquity—</span><verse>2</verse><span>and now it came to pass, if there was no mistake made by this man
   in the reckoning of our time, the thirty and third year had passed
   away;
   </span><verse>3</verse><span>and the people began to look with great earnestness for the sign
   which had been given by the prophet Samuel, the Lamanite, yea, for
   the time that there should be darkness for the space of three days
   over the face of the land.
   </span><verse>4</verse><span>And there began to be great doubtings and disputations among the
   people, notwithstanding so many signs had been given.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>5</verse><span>And it came to pass in the thirty and fourth year, in the first
   month, on the fourth day of the month, there arose a great storm,
   such an one as never had been known in all the land.
   </span><verse>6</verse><span>And there was also a great and terrible tempest; and there was
   terrible thunder, insomuch that it did shake the whole earth as if
   it was about to divide asunder.
   </span><verse>7</verse><span>And there were exceedingly sharp lightnings, such as never had been
   known in all the land.
   </span><verse>8</verse><span>And the city of Zarahemla did take fire.
   </span><verse>9</verse><span>And the city of Moroni did sink into the depths of the sea, and the
   inhabitants thereof were drowned.
   </span><verse>10</verse><span>And the earth was carried up upon the city of Moronihah, that in
   the place of the city there became a great mountain.
   </span><verse>11</verse><span>And there was a great and terrible destruction in the land
   southward.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>12</verse><span>But behold, there was a more great and terrible destruction in the
   land northward; for behold, the whole face of the land was changed,
   because of the tempest and the whirlwinds, and the thunderings and
   the lightnings, and the exceedingly great quaking of the whole
   earth;
   </span><verse>13</verse><span>and the highways were broken up, and the level roads were spoiled,
   and many smooth places became rough.
   </span><verse>14</verse><span>And many great and notable cities were sunk, and
   many were burned, and many were shaken till the buildings thereof had
   fallen to the earth, and the inhabitants thereof were slain, and the
   places were left desolate.
   </span><verse>15</verse><span>And there were
   some cities which remained; but the damage thereof was exceedingly
   great, and there were many in them who were slain.
   </span><verse>16</verse><span>And there were some who were carried away
   in the whirlwind; and whither they went no man knoweth, save they know
   that they were carried away.
   </span><verse>17</verse><span>And thus the
   face of the whole earth became deformed, because of the tempests, and
   the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the quaking of the earth.
   </span><verse>18</verse><span>And behold, the rocks were rent in twain;
   they were broken up upon the face of the whole earth, insomuch that
   they were found in broken fragments, and in seams and in cracks, upon
   all the face of the land.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>19</verse><span>And it came to pass that when the thunderings, and the lightnings,
   and the storm, and the tempest, and the quakings of the earth did
   cease—for behold, they did last for about the space of three hours;
   and it was said by some that the time was greater; nevertheless, all
   these great and terrible things were done in about the space of
   three hours—and then behold, there was darkness upon the face of the
   land.
   </span><verse>20</verse><span>And it came to pass that there was thick darkness upon all the face
   of the land, insomuch that the inhabitants thereof who had not
   fallen could feel the vapor of darkness;
   </span><verse>21</verse><span>and there could be no light, because of the darkness, neither
   candles, neither torches; neither could there be fire kindled with
   their fine and exceedingly dry wood, so that there could not be any
   light at all;
   </span><verse>22</verse><span>and there was not any light seen, neither fire, nor glimmer,
   neither the sun, nor the moon, nor the stars, for so great were the
   mists of darkness which were upon the face of the land.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>23</verse><span>And it came to pass that it did last for the space of three days
   that there was no light seen; and there was great mourning and
   howling and weeping among all the people continually; yea, great
   were the groanings of the people, because of the darkness and the
   great destruction which had come upon them.
   </span><verse>24</verse><span>And in one place they were heard to cry, saying:</span><quote><span>
    O that we had repented before this great and terrible day, and then
    would our brethren have been spared, and they would not have been
    burned in that great city Zarahemla.

  <block>
   <verse>25</verse><span>And in another place they were heard to cry and mourn,

    killed and stoned the prophets, and cast them out; then would our
    mothers and our fair daughters, and our children have been spared, and
    not have been buried up in that great city Moronihah.

  <verse>5</verse><span>And when the multitude had eaten and were filled, he said unto the

   Behold there shall one be ordained among you, and to him will I give power
   that he shall break bread and bless it and give it unto the people of my
   church, unto all those who shall believe and be baptized in my name.
   </span><verse>6</verse><span>And this shall ye always observe to do, even as
   I have done, even as I have broken bread and blessed it and given it unto
   you.
   </span><verse>7</verse><span>And this shall ye do in remembrance of my
   body, which I have shown unto you. And it shall be a testimony unto the
   Father that ye do always remember me. And if ye do always remember me ye
   shall have my Spirit to be with you.

    Blessed are ye for this thing which ye have done, for this is fulfilling
    my commandments, and this doth witness unto the Father that ye are willing
    to do that which I have commanded you.
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>And this
    shall ye always do to those who repent and are baptized in my name; and ye

    always remember me ye shall have my Spirit to be with you.

    among you shall do more or less than these are not built upon my rock, but
    are built upon a sandy foundation; and when the rain descends, and the

   <block>
    <verse>18</verse><span>Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, ye must watch and pray always
    lest ye enter into temptation; for Satan desires to have you, that he
    may sift you as wheat.
    </span><verse>19</verse><span>Therefore ye must always pray unto the Father in my name;
    </span><verse>20</verse><span>and whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, which is right,
    believing that ye shall receive, behold it shall be given unto you.
    </span><verse>21</verse><span>Pray in your families unto the Father, always in my name, that your
    wives and your children may be blessed.</span></block>

    witnessed.
    </span><verse>25</verse><span>And ye see that I have commanded that none of you should go away, but

  unto them:
  </span><quote>
   <block>
    <verse>27</verse><span>Behold verily, verily, I say unto you, I give unto you another
    commandment, and then I must go unto my Father that I may fulfil other
    commandments which he hath given me.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>28</verse><span>And now behold, this is the commandment which I give unto you, that ye
    shall not suffer any one knowingly to partake of my flesh and blood
    unworthily, when ye shall minister it;
    </span><verse>29</verse><span>for whoso eateth and drinketh my flesh and blood unworthily eateth and
    drinketh damnation to his soul; therefore if ye know that a man is
    unworthy to eat and drink of my flesh and blood ye shall forbid him.
    </span><verse>30</verse><span>Nevertheless, ye shall not cast him out from among you, but ye shall
    minister unto him and shall pray for him unto the Father, in my name;
    and if it so be that he repenteth and is baptized in my name, then shall
    ye receive him, and shall minister unto him of my flesh and blood.
    </span><verse>31</verse><span>But if he repent not he shall not be numbered among my people, that he
    may not destroy my people, for behold I know my sheep, and they are numbered.
    </span><verse>32</verse><span>Nevertheless, ye shall not cast him out of
    your synagogues, or your places of worship, for unto such shall ye
    continue to minister; for ye know not but what they will return and
    repent, and come unto me with full purpose of heart, and I shall heal
    them; and ye shall be the means of bringing salvation unto them.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>33</verse><span>Therefore, keep these sayings which I have commanded you that ye come
    not under condemnation; for wo unto him whom the Father condemneth.

    have been among you. And blessed are ye if ye have no disputations among
    you.

  them.

  yet dark, that the multitude had seen Jesus, and that he had ministered
  unto them, and that he would also show himself on the morrow unto the
  multitude.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>Yea, and even all the night it was noised abroad concerning Jesus; and

  and also Mathoni, and Mathonihah, his brother, and Kumen, and Kumenonhi,
  and Jeremiah, and Shemnon, and Jonas, and Zedekiah, and Isaiah—now these

  Receiving the Holy Ghost

  <verse>6</verse><span>And the twelve did teach the multitude; and behold, they did cause that
  the multitude should kneel down upon the face of the earth, and should
  pray unto the Father in the name of Jesus.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And the disciples did pray unto the Father also in the name of
  Jesus.
  And it came to pass that they arose and ministered unto the people.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>And when they had ministered those same words
  which Jesus had spoken—nothing varying from the words which Jesus had
  spoken—behold, they knelt again and prayed to the Father in the name of
  Jesus.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>And they did pray for that which they
  most desired; and they desired that the Holy Ghost should be given unto
  them.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>And when they had thus prayed they went down unto the water’s edge, and
  the multitude followed them.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And it came to pass that Nephi went down into the water and was
  baptized.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And he came up out of the water and began to baptize. And he baptized

  <verse>19</verse><span>And it came to pass that Jesus departed out of the midst of them, and
  went a little way off from them and bowed himself to the earth, and he
  said:</span><quote>
   <verse>20</verse><span>Father, I thank thee that thou hast given the Holy Ghost unto these
   whom I have chosen; and it is because of their belief in me that I have
   chosen them out of the world.
   </span><verse>21</verse><span>Father, I pray thee that thou wilt give the Holy Ghost unto all them
   that shall believe in their words.
   </span><verse>22</verse><span>Father, thou hast given them the Holy Ghost because they believe in me;
   and thou seest that they believe in me because thou hearest them, and
   they pray unto me; and they pray unto me because I am with them.
   </span><verse>23</verse><span>And now Father, I pray unto thee for them, and also for all those who
   shall believe on their words, that they may believe in me, that I may be

  <verse>24</verse><span>And it came to pass that when Jesus had thus prayed unto the Father, he
  came unto his disciples, and behold, they did still continue without
  ceasing to pray unto him; and they did not multiply many words, for it
  was given unto them what they should pray, and they were filled with
  desire.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>And it came to pass that Jesus blessed them as they did pray unto him;
  and his countenance did smile upon them, and the light of his
  countenance did shine upon them, and behold they were as white as the
  countenance and also the garments of Jesus; and behold the whiteness
  thereof did exceed all the whiteness, yea, even there could be nothing
  upon earth so white as the whiteness thereof.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>And Jesus said unto them, “Pray on.” Nevertheless they did not cease to
  pray.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>27</verse><span>And he turned from them again, and went a little way off and bowed
  himself to the earth; and he prayed again unto the Father, saying:

    <verse>28</verse><span>Father, I thank thee that thou hast purified those whom I have chosen,
    because of their faith, and I pray for them, and also for them who shall
    believe on their words, that they may be purified in me, through faith
    on their words, even as they are purified in me.
    </span><verse>29</verse><span>Father, I pray not for the world, but for
    those whom thou hast given me out of the world, because of their faith,
    that they may be purified in me, that I may be in them as thou, Father,
    art in me, that we may be one, that I may be glorified in them.

  Jesus.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>31</verse><span>And it came to pass that he went again a little way off and prayed unto

  tongue cannot speak the words which he prayed, neither can be written by
  man the words which he prayed.
  </span><verse>33</verse><span>And the
  multitude did hear and do bear record; and their hearts were open and they

  <verse>6</verse><span>Now, there had been no bread, neither wine, brought by the disciples,

   <block>
    <verse>1</verse><span>And verily I say unto you, I give unto you a sign, that ye may know the
    time when these things shall be about to take place—that I shall gather
    in, from their long dispersion, my people, O house of Israel, and shall
    establish again among them my Zion;
    </span><verse>2</verse><span>and behold, this is the thing which I will give unto you for a
    sign:</span></block>

   <block><span>
    For verily I say unto you that when these things which I declare unto you,
    and which I shall declare unto you hereafter of myself, and by the power
    of the Holy Ghost which shall be given unto you of the Father, shall be
    made known unto the Gentiles that they may know concerning this people who
    are a remnant of the house of Jacob, and concerning this my people who
    shall be scattered by them.
    </span><verse>3</verse><span>Verily, verily, I
    say unto you, when these things shall be made known unto them of the
    Father, and shall come forth of the Father, from them unto you;</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>4</verse><span>For it is wisdom in the Father that they should be established in this
    land, and be set up as a free people by the power of the Father, that
    these things might come forth from them unto a remnant of your seed,
    that the covenant of the Father may be fulfilled which he hath
    covenanted with his people, O house of Israel;</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>5</verse><span>Therefore, when these works and the works which shall be wrought among
    you hereafter shall come forth from the Gentiles, unto your seed which
    shall dwindle in unbelief because of iniquity;</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>6</verse><span>For thus it behooveth the Father that it should come forth from the
    Gentiles, that he may show forth his power unto the Gentiles, for this
    cause that the Gentiles, if they will not harden their hearts, that they
    may repent and come unto me and be baptized in my name and know of the
    true points of my doctrine, that they may be numbered among my people, O
    house of Israel.</span></block>

  <verse>23</verse><span>And it came to pass that thus they did go forth among all the people of
  Nephi, and did preach the gospel of Christ unto all people upon the face
  of the land; and they were converted unto the Lord, and were united unto
  the church of Christ, and thus the people of that generation were
  blessed, according to the word of Jesus.

    <verse>24</verse><span>And now I, Mormon, make an end of speaking concerning these things for
    a time.
    </span><verse>25</verse><span>Behold, I was about to write the names of those who were never to taste
    of death, but the Lord forbade; therefore I write them not, for they are
    hid from the world.
    </span><verse>26</verse><span>But behold, I have seen them, and they have ministered unto me.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>27</verse><span>And behold they will be among the Gentiles, and the Gentiles shall know
    them not.
    </span><verse>28</verse><span>They will also be among the Jews, and the Jews shall know them not.
    </span><verse>29</verse><span>And it shall come to pass, when the Lord seeth fit in his wisdom that
    they shall minister unto all the scattered tribes of Israel, and unto
    all nations, kindreds, tongues and people, and shall bring out of them
    unto Jesus many souls, that their desire may be fulfilled, and also
    because of the convincing power of God which is in them.
    </span><verse>30</verse><span>And they are as the angels of God, and if they shall pray unto the
    Father in the name of Jesus they can show themselves unto whatsoever man
    it seemeth them good.
    </span><verse>31</verse><span>Therefore, great and marvelous works shall be wrought by them, before
    the great and coming day when all people must surely stand before the
    judgment-seat of Christ;
    </span><verse>32</verse><span>yea even among the Gentiles shall there be a great and marvelous work
    wrought by them, before that judgment day.

    <verse>33</verse><span>And if ye had all the scriptures which give an account of all the
    marvelous works of
    Christ, ye would, according to the words of Christ, know that these things
    must surely come.
    </span><verse>34</verse><span>And wo be unto him that will
    not hearken unto the words of Jesus, and also to them whom he hath chosen
    and sent among them; for whoso receiveth not the words of Jesus and the
    words of those whom he hath sent receiveth not him; and therefore he will
    not receive them at the last day;
    </span><verse>35</verse><span>and it would
    be better for them if they had not been born. For do ye suppose that ye
    can get rid of the justice of an offended God, who hath been trampled
    under feet of men, that thereby salvation might come?

    <verse>36</verse><span>And now behold, as I spake concerning those whom the Lord hath chosen,
    yea, even three who were caught up into the heavens, that I knew not
    whether they were cleansed from mortality to immortality—</span><verse>37</verse><span>but behold, since I wrote, I have inquired of the Lord, and he hath
    made it manifest unto me that there must needs be a change wrought upon
    their bodies, or else it needs be that they must taste of death;
    </span><verse>38</verse><span>therefore, that they might not taste of death there was a change
    wrought upon their bodies, that they might not suffer pain nor sorrow
    save it were for the sins of the world.
    </span><verse>39</verse><span>Now this change was not equal to that which shall take place at the
    last day; but there was a change wrought upon them, insomuch that Satan
    could have no power over them, that he could not tempt them; and they
    were sanctified in the flesh, that they were holy, and that the powers
    of the earth could not hold them.
    </span><verse>40</verse><span>And in this state they were to remain until the judgment day of Christ;
    and at that day they were to receive a greater change, and to be
    received into the kingdom of the Father to go no more out, but to dwell
    with God eternally in the heavens.

    Warning to modern Gentiles

   <chapter>29</chapter>

   <block>
    <verse>1</verse><span>And now behold, I say unto you that when the Lord shall see fit, in his
    wisdom, that these sayings shall come unto the Gentiles according to his
    word, then ye may know that the covenant which the Father hath made with
    the children of Israel, concerning their restoration to the lands of
    their inheritance, is already beginning to be fulfilled.
    </span><verse>2</verse><span>And ye may know that the words of the Lord, which have been spoken by
    the holy prophets, shall all be fulfilled; and ye need not say that the
    Lord delays his coming unto the children of Israel.
    </span><verse>3</verse><span>And ye need not imagine in your hearts that the words which have been
    spoken are vain, for behold, the Lord will remember his covenant which
    he hath made unto his people of the house of Israel.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>4</verse><span>And when ye shall see these sayings coming forth among you, then ye
    need not any longer spurn at the doings of the Lord, for the sword of
    his justice is in his right hand; and behold, at that day, if ye shall
    spurn at his doings he will cause that it shall soon overtake you.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>5</verse><span>Wo unto him that spurneth at the doings of the Lord; yea, wo unto him
    that shall deny the Christ and his works!
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>Yea, wo unto him that shall deny the revelations of the Lord, and that
    shall say the Lord no longer worketh by revelation, or by prophecy, or
    by gifts, or by tongues, or by healings, or by the power of the Holy
    Ghost!
    </span><verse>7</verse><span>Yea, and wo unto him that shall say at that day, to get gain, that
    there can be no miracle wrought by Jesus Christ; for he that doeth this
    shall become like unto the son of perdition, for whom there was no
    mercy, according to the word of Christ!
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>8</verse><span>Yea, and ye need not any longer hiss, nor spurn, nor make game of the
    Jews, nor any of the remnant of the house of Israel; for behold, the
    Lord remembereth his covenant unto them, and he will do unto them
    according to that which he hath sworn.
    </span><verse>9</verse><span>Therefore ye need not suppose that ye can turn the right hand of the
    Lord unto the left, that he may not
    execute judgment unto the fulfilling of the covenant which he hath made
    unto the house of Israel.

    <verse>1</verse><span>Hearken, O ye Gentiles, and hear the words of Jesus Christ, the Son of
    the living God, which he hath commanded me that I should speak
    concerning you, for, behold he commandeth me that I should write,
    saying:</span><quote>
     <verse>2</verse><span>Turn, all ye Gentiles, from your wicked ways; and repent of your evil
     doings, of your lyings and deceivings, and of your whoredoms, and of
     your secret abominations, and your idolatries, and of your murders, and
     your priestcrafts, and your envyings, and your strifes, and from all
     your wickedness and abominations, and come unto me, and be baptized in
     my name, that ye may receive a remission of your sins and be filled with
     the Holy Ghost, that ye may be numbered with my people who are of the
     house of Israel.</span></quote>
