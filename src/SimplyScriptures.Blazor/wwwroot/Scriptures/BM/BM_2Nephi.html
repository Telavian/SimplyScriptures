  THE WORDS OF LEHI

  TO NEPHI’S BRETHREN

 <chapter>1
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And now it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had made an end of
  teaching my brethren, our father, Lehi, also spake many things unto
  them, and rehearsed unto them, how great things the Lord had done
  for them in bringing them out of the land of Jerusalem.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And he spake unto them concerning their rebellions upon the waters,
  and the mercies of God in sparing their lives, that they were not
  swallowed up in the sea.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And he also spake unto them concerning the land of promise, which
  they had obtained—how merciful the Lord had been in warning us that
  we should flee out of the land of Jerusalem.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>For, behold, said he:</span><quote><span>
   I have seen a vision, in which I know that Jerusalem is destroyed; and
   had we remained in Jerusalem we should also have perished.
   </span><verse>5</verse><span>But, said he, notwithstanding our
   afflictions, we have obtained a land of promise, a land which is
   choice above all other lands; a land which the Lord God hath
   covenanted with me should be a land for the inheritance of my seed.
   Yea, the Lord hath
   </span><under>
    <original><span>consecrated</span></original><span>covenanted</span></under><span>
   this land unto me, and to my
   children forever, and also all those who should be led out of other
   countries by the hand of the Lord.

  Prophecy of the promised land

  <quote>
   <block>
    <verse>6</verse><span>Wherefore, I, Lehi, prophesy according to
    the workings of the Spirit which is in me, that there
    </span><under>
     <original><span>shall be</span></original><span>shall</span></under><span>
    none come into this land save they shall be brought by
    the hand of the Lord.
    </span><verse>7</verse><span>Wherefore, this land
    is consecrated unto him whom he shall bring. And if it so be that they
    shall serve him according to the commandments which he hath given, it
    shall be a land of liberty unto them; wherefore, they shall never be
    brought down into captivity; if so, it shall be because of iniquity;
    for if iniquity shall abound cursed shall be the land for their sakes,
    but unto the righteous it shall be blessed forever.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>8</verse><span>And behold, it is wisdom that this land should be kept as yet from
    the knowledge of other nations; for behold, many nations would
    overrun the land, that there would be no place for an inheritance.
    </span><verse>9</verse><span>Wherefore, I, Lehi, have obtained a promise, that inasmuch as those
    whom the Lord God shall bring out of the land of Jerusalem shall
    keep his commandments, they shall prosper upon the face of this
    land; and they shall be kept from all other nations, that they may
    possess this land unto themselves. And if it so be that they shall
    keep his commandments they shall be blessed upon the face of this
    land, and there shall be none to molest them, nor to take away the
    land of their inheritance; and they shall dwell safely
    forever.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>10</verse><span>But behold, when the time cometh that they shall dwindle in
    unbelief, after they have received so great blessings from the hand
    of the Lord—
    </span><dot><span>having a knowledge of the creation of the earth and all men,</span></dot>
    <dot><span>knowing the great and marvelous works of the Lord from the creation of the world;</span></dot>
    <dot><span>having power given them to do all things by faith;</span></dot>
    <dot><span>having all the commandments from the beginning; and</span></dot>
    <dot><span>having been brought by his infinite goodness into this precious land of promise—</span></dot>
   </block>

   <block><span>
     Behold, I say, if the day shall come that they will reject the Holy
     One of Israel, the true Messiah, their Redeemer and their God, behold,
     the judgments of him that is just shall rest upon them.
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>Yea, he will bring other nations unto them,
     and he will give unto them power, and he will take away from them the
     lands of their possessions, and he will cause them to be scattered and
     smitten.
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>Yea, as one generation passeth to
     another there shall be bloodsheds, and great visitations among them.

      <verse>24</verse><span>Rebel no more against your brother, whose views have been glorious,
      and who hath kept the commandments from the time that we left
      Jerusalem; and who hath been an instrument in the hands of God, in

      authority over you, but he hath sought the glory of God, and your own
      eternal welfare.
      </span><verse>26</verse><span>And ye have murmured
      because he hath been plain unto you. Ye say that he hath used
      sharpness; ye say that he hath been angry with you; but behold, his
      sharpness was the sharpness of the power of the word of God, which was

      Wherefore, I know that thou art redeemed, because of the righteousness

      And the way is prepared from the fall of man, and salvation is free.
      </span><verse>5</verse><span>And men are instructed sufficiently that

      the inhabitants of the earth, that they may know that there is no

      his life according to the flesh, and taketh it again by the power of

      Wherefore, the ends of the law which the Holy One hath given, unto the
      inflicting of the punishment which is affixed, which punishment that
      is affixed is in opposition to that of the happiness which is affixed,
      to answer the ends of the atonement—</span><verse>11</verse><span>for it
      must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things. If not so,
      my first-born in the wilderness, righteousness could not be brought to
      pass, neither wickedness, neither holiness nor misery, neither good
      nor bad.</span></block>

     <block><span>
      Wherefore, all things must needs be a compound in one; wherefore, if
      it should be one body it must needs remain as dead, having no life
      neither death, nor corruption nor incorruption, happiness nor misery,
      neither sense nor insensibility.
      </span><verse>12</verse><span>Wherefore,
      it must needs have been created for a thing of naught; wherefore there
      would have been no purpose in the end of its creation. Wherefore, this

      <verse>3</verse><span>And now, Joseph, my last-born, whom I have brought out of the

      thy seed shall not utterly be destroyed.
      </span><verse>4</verse><span>For behold, thou art the fruit of my loins; and I am a descendant
      of Joseph who was carried captive into Egypt. And great were the
      covenants of the Lord which he made unto Joseph.
      </span><verse>5</verse><span>Wherefore, Joseph truly saw our day.</span></block>

     <block><span>
      And he obtained a promise of the Lord, that out of the fruit of his
      loins the Lord God would raise up a righteous branch unto the house of
      Israel; not the Messiah, but a branch which was to be broken off,
      nevertheless, to be remembered in the covenants
      of the Lord that the Messiah should be made manifest unto them in the
      latter days, in the spirit of power, unto the bringing of them out of
      darkness unto light—yea, out of hidden darkness and out of captivity
      unto freedom.</span></block>

     <block>
      <verse>6</verse><span>For Joseph truly testified, saying:</span><quote><span>
       A seer shall the Lord my God raise up, who shall be a choice seer unto

        loins, his brethren, which shall be of great worth unto them, even to

         </span><verse>9</verse><span>And he shall be great like unto Moses, whom I have said I would
         raise up unto you, to deliver my people, O house of Israel.

         fruit of the loins of Judah, shall grow together, unto the
         confounding of false doctrines and laying down of contentions, and
         establishing peace among the fruit of thy loins, and bringing them

  No deliverance without atonement

    Wherefore I know that ye know that our flesh must waste away and die;
    nevertheless, in our bodies we shall see God.
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>Yea, I know that ye know that in the body he
    shall show himself unto those at Jerusalem, from whence we came; for
    it is expedient that it should be among them; for it behooveth the
    great Creator that he suffereth himself to become subject unto man in
    the flesh, and die for all men, that all men might become subject unto
    him.
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>For as death hath passed upon all men,
    to fulfil the merciful plan of the great Creator, there must needs be
    a power of resurrection, and the resurrection must needs come unto man
    by reason of the fall; and the fall came by reason of transgression;
    and because man became fallen they were cut off from the presence of
    the Lord.
    </span><verse>7</verse><span>Wherefore, it must needs be an
    infinite atonement.</span></block>

   <block><span>
    Save it should be an infinite atonement this corruption could not put
    on incorruption. Wherefore, the first judgment which came upon man
    must needs have remained to an endless duration. And if so, this flesh
    must have laid down to rot and to crumble to its mother earth, to rise
    no more.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>8</verse><span>O the wisdom of God, his mercy and grace! For behold, if the flesh
    should rise no more our spirits must become subject to that angel
    who fell from before the presence of the Eternal God, and became the
    devil, to rise no more.
    </span><verse>9</verse><span>And our spirits must have
    become like unto him, and we become devils, angels to a devil, to be
    shut out from the presence of our God, and to remain with the father
    of lies, in misery, like unto himself; yea, to that being who beguiled
    our first parents, who transformeth himself nigh unto an angel of

  <verse>2</verse><span>And now I, Nephi, write more of the words of Isaiah, for my soul
  delighteth in his words. For I will liken his words unto my people, and
  I will send them forth unto all my
  children, for he verily saw my Redeemer, even as I have seen him.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And my brother, Jacob, also has seen him as I
  have seen him; wherefore, I will send their words forth unto my children
  to prove unto them that my words are true. Wherefore, by the words of
  three, God hath said, I will establish my word. Nevertheless, God sendeth
  more witnesses, and he proveth all his words.

  <verse>4</verse><span>Behold, my soul delighteth in proving unto my people the truth of the
  coming of Christ; for, for this end hath the law of Moses been given;
  and all things which have been given of God from the beginning of the
  world, unto man, are the typifying of him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>And also my soul delighteth in the covenants of the Lord which he hath
  made to our fathers.
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  Yea, my soul delighteth in his grace, and in his justice, and power, and
  mercy in the great and eternal plan of deliverance from death.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And my soul delighteth in proving unto my people that save Christ
  should come all men must perish.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>For if there be no Christ there be no God; and if there be no God we
  are not, for there could have been no creation. But there is a God, and
  he is Christ, and he cometh in the fulness of his own time.

    <verse>1</verse><span>In the year that king Uzziah died, I saw also the Lord sitting upon a
    throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.
    </span><verse>2</verse><span>Above it stood the seraphim; each one had six wings; with twain he
    covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he
    did fly.
    </span><verse>3</verse><span>And one cried unto another, and said, “Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of
    Hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory.”
    </span><verse>4</verse><span>And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the

    <verse>6</verse><span>Then flew one of the seraphim unto me, having a live coal in his hand,
    which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar;
    </span><verse>7</verse><span>and he laid it upon my mouth, and said:</span><quote><span>
     Lo, this has touched thy lips; and thy iniquity is taken away, and thy sin

      <verse>7</verse><span>Thus saith the Lord God: It shall not stand, neither shall it come to

      within three score and five years shall Ephraim be broken that it be not

  NEPHI PROPHESIES
 </span></blockheading>
 <chapter>25
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Now I, Nephi, do speak somewhat concerning the words which I have
  written, which have been spoken by the mouth of Isaiah.
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  For behold, Isaiah spake many things which were hard for many of my people
  to understand; for they know not concerning the manner of prophesying
  among the Jews.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>For I, Nephi, have not taught
  them many things concerning the manner of the Jews; for their works were
  works of darkness, and their doings were doings of abominations.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>Wherefore, I write unto my people, unto all those that shall receive
  hereafter these things which I write, that they may know the judgments
  of God, that they come upon all nations, according to the word which he
  hath spoken.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Wherefore, hearken, O my people, which are of the house of Israel, and
  give ear unto my words, for because the words of Isaiah are not plain
  unto you; nevertheless they are plain unto all those that are filled
  with the spirit of prophecy.
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  But I give unto you a prophecy, according to the Spirit which is in me;
  wherefore I shall prophesy according to the plainness which hath been with
  me from the time that I came out from Jerusalem with my father; for
  behold, my soul delighteth in plainness unto my
  people, that they may learn.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>Yea, and my soul
  delighteth in the words of Isaiah, for I came out from Jerusalem, and mine
  eyes hath beheld the things of the Jews.
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  And I know that the Jews do understand the things of the prophets, and
  there is none other people that understand the things which were spoken
  unto the Jews like unto them, save it be that they are taught after the
  manner of the things of the Jews.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>But behold, I,
  Nephi, have not taught my children after the manner of the Jews; but
  behold, I, of myself, have dwelt at Jerusalem, wherefore I know concerning
  the regions round about; and I have made mention unto my children
  concerning the judgments of God, which hath come to pass among the Jews,
  unto my children, according to all that which Isaiah hath spoken, and I do
  not write them.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>But behold, I proceed with mine own prophecy, according to my
  plainness; in the which I know that no man can err; nevertheless, in the
  days that the prophecies of Isaiah shall be fulfilled men shall know of
  a surety, at the times when they shall come to pass.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>Wherefore, they are of worth unto the children of men, and he that
  supposeth that they are not, unto them will I speak particularly, and
  confine the words unto mine own people; for I know that they shall be of
  great worth unto them in the last days; for in that day shall they
  understand them; wherefore, for their good have I written them.
 </span></block>

  About the Jews
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>And as one generation hath been destroyed among the Jews because of
  iniquity, even so have they been destroyed from generation to generation
  according to their iniquities; and never hath any of them been destroyed
  save it were foretold them by the prophets of the Lord.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>Wherefore, it hath been told them concerning the destruction which
  should come upon them, immediately after my father left Jerusalem;
  nevertheless, they hardened their hearts; and according to my prophecy
  they have been destroyed, save it be those which are carried away
  captive into Babylon.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And now this I speak because of the Spirit which is in me.
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  And notwithstanding they have been carried away they shall return again,
  and possess the land of Jerusalem; wherefore, they shall be restored again
  to the land of their inheritance.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>But, behold,
  they shall have wars, and rumors of wars.
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  And when the day cometh that the Only Begotten of the Father, yea, even
  the Father of heaven and of earth, shall manifest himself unto them in the
  flesh, behold, they will reject him, because of their iniquities, and the
  hardness of their hearts, and the stiffness of their necks.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>Behold, they will crucify him; and after he is
  laid in a sepulchre for the space of three days he shall rise from the
  dead, with healing in his wings; and all those who shall believe on his
  name shall be saved in the kingdom of God. Wherefore, my soul delighteth
  to prophesy concerning him, for I have seen his day, and my heart doth
  magnify his holy name.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>And behold it shall come to pass that after the Messiah hath risen from
  the dead, and hath manifested himself unto his people, unto as many as
  will believe on his name, behold, Jerusalem shall be destroyed again;
  for wo unto them that fight against God and the people of his church.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>Wherefore, the Jews shall be scattered among all nations; yea, and also
  Babylon shall be destroyed; wherefore, the Jews shall be scattered by
  other nations.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>And after they have been scattered, and the Lord God hath scourged them
  by other nations for the space of many generations, yea, even down from
  generation to generation until they shall be persuaded to believe in
  Christ, the Son of God, and the atonement, which is infinite for all
  mankind—and when that day shall come that they shall believe in Christ,
  and worship the Father in his name, with pure hearts and clean hands,
  and look
  not forward any more for another Messiah, then, at that time, the day will
  come that it must needs be expedient that they should believe these
  things.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And the Lord will set his hand again
  the second time to restore his people from their lost and fallen state.
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  Wherefore, he will proceed to do a marvelous work and a wonder among the
  children of men.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>Wherefore, he shall bring
  forth his words unto them, which words shall judge them at the last day,
  for they shall be given them for the purpose of convincing them of the
  true Messiah, who was rejected by them; and unto the convincing of them
  that they need not look forward any more for a Messiah to come, for there
  should not any come, save it should be a false Messiah which should
  deceive the people; for there is save one Messiah spoken of by the
  prophets, and that Messiah is he who should be rejected of the Jews.</span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>For according to the words of the prophets, the Messiah cometh in six
  hundred years from the time that my father left Jerusalem; and according
  to the words of the prophets, and also the word of the angel of God, his
  name shall be Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</span></block>

 <heading><span>
  The law of Moses
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>And now, my brethren, I have spoken plainly that ye cannot err. And as
  the Lord God liveth that brought Israel up out of the land of Egypt, and
  gave unto Moses power that he should heal the nations after they had
  been bitten by the poisonous serpents, if they would cast their eyes
  unto the serpent which he did raise up before them, and also gave him
  power that he should smite the rock and the water should come forth;
  yea, behold I say unto you, that as these things are true, and as the
  Lord God liveth, there is none other name given under heaven save it be
  this Jesus Christ, of which I have spoken, whereby man can be
  saved.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>Wherefore, for this cause hath the Lord God promised unto me that these
  things which I write shall be kept and preserved, and handed down unto
  my seed, from generation to generation, that the promise may be
  fulfilled unto Joseph, that his seed should never perish as long as the
  earth should stand.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>Wherefore, these things shall go from generation to generation as long
  as the earth shall stand; and they shall go according to the will and
  pleasure of God; and the nations who shall possess them shall be judged
  of them according to the words which are written.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>For we labor diligently to write, to persuade our children, and also
  our brethren, to believe in Christ, and to be reconciled to God; for we
  know that it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>And, notwithstanding we believe in Christ, we keep the law of Moses,
  and look forward with steadfastness unto Christ, until the law shall be
  fulfilled.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>For, for this end was the law given; wherefore the law hath become dead
  unto us, and we are made alive in Christ because of our faith; yet we
  keep the law because of the commandments.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>26</verse><span>And we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we
  prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our
  children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their
  sins.
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>Wherefore, we speak concerning the law that our children may know the
  deadness of the law; and they, by knowing the deadness of the law, may
  look forward unto that life which is in Christ, and know for what end
  the law was given. And after the law is fulfilled in Christ, that they
  need not harden their hearts against him when the law ought to be done
  away.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>28</verse><span>And now behold, my people, ye are a stiffnecked people; wherefore, I
  have spoken plainly unto you, that ye cannot misunderstand. And the
  words which I have spoken shall stand as a testimony against you; for
  they are sufficient to teach any man the right way; for the right way is to believe in Christ and deny him not; for by denying
  him ye also deny the prophets and the law.
  </span><verse>29</verse><span>And now behold, I say unto you that the right
  way is to believe in Christ and deny him not; and Christ is the Holy One
  of Israel; wherefore ye must bow down before him, and worship him with all
  your might, mind, and strength, and your whole soul; and if ye do this ye
  shall in nowise be cast out.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>30</verse><span>And, inasmuch as it shall be expedient, ye must keep the performances
  and ordinances of God until the law shall be fulfilled which was given
  unto Moses.
  </span><chapter>26</chapter>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And after Christ shall have risen from the dead he shall show himself
  unto you, my children, and my beloved brethren; and the words which he
  shall speak unto you shall be the law which ye shall do.

  The seed of Lehi
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>For behold, I say unto you that I have beheld that many generations
  shall pass away, and there shall be great wars and contentions among my
  people.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And after the Messiah shall come there shall be signs given unto my
  people of his birth, and also of his death and resurrection; and great
  and terrible shall that day be unto the wicked, for they shall perish;
  and they perish because they cast out the prophets, and the saints, and
  stone them, and slay them; wherefore the cry of the blood of the saints
  shall ascend up to God from the ground against them.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Wherefore, all those who are proud, and that do wickedly, the day that
  cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of Hosts, for they shall be as
  stubble.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And they that kill the prophets, and the saints, the depths of the
  earth shall swallow them up, saith the Lord of Hosts; and mountains
  shall cover them, and whirlwinds shall carry them away, and buildings
  shall fall upon them and crush them to pieces and grind them to powder.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And they shall be visited with thunderings, and lightnings, and
  earthquakes, and all manner of destructions, for the fire of the anger
  of the Lord shall be kindled against them, and they shall be as stubble,
  and the day that cometh shall consume them, saith the Lord of
  Hosts.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>O the pain, and the anguish of my soul for the loss of the slain of my
  people! For I, Nephi, have seen it, and it well nigh consumeth me before
  the presence of the Lord; but I must cry unto my God, “Thy ways are
  just.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>But behold, the righteous that hearken unto the words of the prophets,
  and destroy them not, but look forward unto Christ with steadfastness
  for the signs which are given, notwithstanding all persecution—behold,
  they are they which shall not perish.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>But the Son of righteousness shall appear unto them; and he shall heal
  them, and they shall have peace with him, until three generations shall
  have passed away, and many of the fourth generation shall have passed
  away in righteousness.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>And when these things have passed away a speedy destruction cometh unto
  my people; for, notwithstanding the pains of my soul, I have seen it;
  wherefore, I know that it shall come to pass; and they sell themselves
  for naught; for, for the reward of their pride and their foolishness
  they shall reap destruction; for because they yield unto the devil and
  choose works of darkness rather than light, therefore they must go down
  to hell.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>For the Spirit of the Lord will not always strive with man. And when
  the Spirit ceaseth to strive with man then cometh speedy destruction,
  and this grieveth my soul.

  THE GENTILES
 </span></blockheading>
 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>And as I spake concerning the convincing of the Jews, that Jesus is the
  very Christ, it must needs be that the Gentiles be convinced also that
  Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God;
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>and that he manifesteth himself unto all those who believe in him, by
  the power of the
  Holy Ghost; yea, unto every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, working
  mighty miracles, signs, and wonders, among the children of men according
  to their faith.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>But behold, I prophesy unto you concerning the last days; concerning
  the days when the Lord God shall bring these things forth unto the
  children of men.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>After my seed and the seed of my brethren shall have dwindled in
  unbelief, and shall have been smitten by the Gentiles; yea, after the
  Lord God shall have camped against them round about, and shall have laid
  siege against them with a mount, and raised forts against them; and
  after they shall have been brought down low in the dust, even that they
  are not, yet the words of the righteous shall be written, and the
  prayers of the faithful shall be heard, and all those who have dwindled
  in unbelief shall not be forgotten.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>For those who shall be destroyed shall speak unto them out of the
  ground, and their speech shall be low out of the dust, and their voice
  shall be as one that hath a familiar spirit; for the Lord God will give
  unto him power, that he may whisper concerning them, even as it were out
  of the ground; and their speech shall whisper out of the dust.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>For thus saith the Lord God: They shall write the things which shall be
  done among them, and they shall be written and sealed up in a book, and
  those who have dwindled in unbelief shall not have them, for they seek
  to destroy the things of God.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>Wherefore, as those who have been destroyed have been destroyed
  speedily; and the multitude of their terrible ones shall be as chaff
  that passeth away—yea, thus saith the Lord God:</span><quote><span>
   It shall be at an instant, suddenly.
  </span></quote>

  Churches and priestcraft

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>And the Gentiles are lifted up in the pride of their eyes, and have
  stumbled, because of the greatness of their stumbling block, that they
  have built up many churches; nevertheless, they put down the power and
  miracles of God, and preach up unto themselves their own wisdom and
  their own learning, that they may get gain and grind upon the face of
  the poor.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>And there are many churches built up which cause envyings, and strifes,

 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>And there are also secret combinations, even as in times of old,
  according to the combinations of the devil, for he is the founder of all
  these things; yea, the founder of murder, and works of darkness; yea,
  and he leadeth them by the neck with a flaxen cord, until he bindeth
  them with his strong cords forever.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>For behold, my beloved brethren, I say unto you that the Lord God

  </span><verse>24</verse><span>He doth not anything save it be for the benefit of the world; for he
  loveth the world, even that he layeth down his own life that he may draw
  all men unto him.
  Wherefore, he commandeth none that they shall not partake of his
  salvation.

 <block>
  <verse>27</verse><span>Hath he commanded any that they should not partake of his salvation?

 <block>
  <verse>28</verse><span>Behold, hath the Lord commanded any that they should not partake of his
  goodness? Behold I say unto you nay; but all men are privileged the one
  like unto the other, and none are forbidden.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>29</verse><span>He commandeth that there shall be no priestcrafts; for, behold,
  priestcrafts are that men preach and set themselves up for a light unto
  the world, that they may get gain and praise of the world; but they seek
  not the welfare of Zion.
  </span><verse>30</verse><span>Behold, the Lord hath forbidden this thing; wherefore, the Lord God

  is love. And except they should have charity they were nothing.
  Wherefore, if they should have charity they would not suffer the laborer
  in Zion to perish.

  <dot><span>that they should not take the name of the Lord their God in vain;</span></dot>

  men; and he inviteth them all to come unto him and partake of his
  goodness; and he denieth none that come unto him, black and white,

  <verse>10</verse><span>But the words which are sealed he shall not deliver, neither shall
  he deliver the book. For the book shall be sealed by the power of
  God, and the revelation which was sealed shall be kept in the book
  until the own due time of the Lord, that they may come forth; for
  behold, they reveal all things from the foundation of the world unto
  the end thereof.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And the day cometh that the words of the book which were sealed
  shall be read upon the house tops; and they shall be read by the
  power of Christ; and all things shall be revealed unto the children
  of men which ever have been among the children of men, and which
  ever will be even unto the end of the earth.

  <verse>12</verse><span>Wherefore, at that day when the book shall be delivered unto the

  the world, that the eyes of none shall behold it save it be that
  three witnesses shall behold it, by the power of God, besides him to
  whom the book shall be delivered; and they shall testify to the
  truth of the book and the things therein.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And there is none other which shall view it, save it be a few
  according to the will of God, to bear testimony of his word unto the
  children of men; for the Lord God hath said that the words of the
  faithful should speak as if it were from the dead.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>Wherefore, the Lord God will proceed to bring forth the words of
  the book; and in the mouth of as many witnesses as seemeth him good
  will he establish his word; and wo be unto him that rejecteth the
  word of God!

   Take these words which are not sealed and deliver them to another,
   that he may show them unto the learned, saying, “Read this, I pray
   thee.”
  </span></quote>

  And the learned shall say, “Bring hither the book, and I will read

  God.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And the man shall say, “I cannot bring

  </span><verse>18</verse><span>Then shall the
  learned say, “I cannot read it.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>Wherefore it shall come to pass, that the Lord God will deliver
  again the book and the words thereof to him that is not learned; and
  the man that is not learned shall say, “I am not learned.”
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>Then shall the Lord God say unto him:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>
    The learned shall not read them, for they have rejected them, and I am
    able to do mine own work; wherefore thou shalt read the words which I
    shall give unto thee.

   <block>
    <verse>21</verse><span>Touch not the things which are sealed, for I will bring them forth
    in mine own due time; for I will show unto the children of men that

    </span><verse>22</verse><span>Wherefore, when thou hast read the words which I have commanded
    thee, and obtained the witnesses which I have promised unto thee,
    then shalt thou seal up the book again, and hide it up unto me, that
    I may preserve the words which thou hast not read, until I shall see
    fit in mine own wisdom to reveal all things unto the children of
    men.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>23</verse><span>For behold, I am God; and I am a god of miracles; and I will show

  THE WORDS OF NEPHI
 </span></subsectionheading>
 <chapter>31</chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And now I, Nephi, make an end of my prophesying unto you, my
  beloved brethren. And I cannot write but a few things, which I
  know must surely come to pass; neither can I write but a few of
  the words of my brother Jacob.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>Wherefore, the things which I have written sufficeth me, save
  it be a few words which I must speak concerning the doctrine of
  Christ.
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  Wherefore, I shall speak unto you plainly, according to the
  plainness of my prophesying.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>For my soul
  delighteth in plainness; for after this manner doth the Lord God
  work among the children of men. For the Lord God giveth light unto
  the understanding; for he speaketh unto men according to their
  language, unto their understanding.
 </span></block>

 <blockheading><span>
  THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST
 </span></blockheading>
 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Wherefore, I would that ye should
  remember that I have spoken unto you concerning that prophet which
  the Lord showed unto me, that should baptize the Lamb of God,
  which should take away the
  </span><under>
   <printer><span>sin</span></printer><span>sins</span></under><span>
  of the world.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And now, if the Lamb of God, he being
  holy, should have need to be baptized by water, to fulfil all
  righteousness, O then, how much more need have we, being unholy,
  to be baptized, yea, even by water!
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And
  now, I would ask of you, my beloved brethren, wherein the Lamb of
  God did fulfil all righteousness in being baptized by water?
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>Know ye not that he was holy? But
  notwithstanding he being holy, he showeth unto the children of men
  that, according to the flesh he humbleth himself before the
  Father, and witnesseth unto the Father that he would be obedient
  unto him in keeping his commandments.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>Wherefore, after he was baptized with water the Holy Ghost
  descended upon him in the form of a dove.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>And again, it showeth unto the children of men the straitness
  of the path, and the narrowness of the gate, by which they
  should enter, he having set the example before them.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And he said unto the children of men, “Follow thou me.”
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  Wherefore, my beloved brethren, can we follow Jesus save we shall
  be willing to keep the commandments of the Father?
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>And the Father said:</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>Repent ye, repent ye, and be baptized in the name of my Beloved Son.</span></indent>
  <verse>12</verse><span>And also, the voice of the Son came unto me, saying:</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>He that is baptized in my name, to him will the Father give the Holy Ghost, like unto</span></indent>
  <indent><span>me; wherefore, follow me, and do the things which ye have seen me do.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, I know that if ye shall follow
  the Son with full purpose of heart, acting no hypocrisy and no
  deception before God but with real intent, repenting of your
  sins, witnessing unto the Father that ye are willing to take
  upon you the name of Christ by baptism—yea, by following your
  Lord and your Savior down into the water according to his word,
  behold, then shall ye receive the Holy Ghost; yea, then cometh
  the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost, and then can ye speak
  with the tongue of angels and shout praises unto the Holy One of
  Israel.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>But, behold, my beloved brethren, thus came the voice of the
  Son unto me, saying:</span><quote><span>
   After ye have repented of your sins, and witnessed unto the Father
   that ye are willing to keep my commandments by the baptism of
   water, and have received the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost
   and can speak with a new tongue, yea, even with the tongue of
   angels, and after this should deny me, it would have been better
   for you that ye had not known me.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And I heard a voice from the Father, saying:</span><quote><span>
   Yea, the words of my Beloved are true and faithful. He that
   endureth to the end, the same shall be saved.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <heading><span>
  The gate to the strait and narrow path
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>And now, my beloved brethren, I know by this that unless a man
  shall endure to the end in following the example of the Son of
  the living God, he cannot be saved.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>Wherefore, do the things which I have told you I have seen that
  your Lord and your Redeemer should do; for, for this cause have
  they been shown unto me, that ye might know the gate by which ye
  should enter. For the gate by which ye should enter is
  repentance and baptism by water, and then cometh a remission of
  your sins by fire and by the Holy Ghost.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>And then are ye in this strait and narrow path which leads to
  eternal life; yea, ye have entered in by the gate; ye have done
  according to the commandments of the Father and the Son and ye
  have received the Holy Ghost, which witnesses of the Father and
  the Son, unto the fulfilling of the promise which he hath made
  that if ye entered in by the way ye should receive.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>And now, my beloved brethren, after ye have gotten into this
  strait and narrow path, I would ask if all is done? Behold, I
  say unto you nay; for ye have not come thus far save it were by
  the word of Christ with unshaken faith in him, relying wholly
  upon the merits of him who is mighty to save.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in
  Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God
  and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting
  upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus
  saith the Father:</span><quote><span>
   Ye shall have eternal life.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>And now, behold, my beloved brethren, this is the way; and
  there is none other way nor name given under heaven whereby man
  can be saved in the kingdom of God. And now, behold, this is the
  doctrine of Christ, and the only and true doctrine of the
  Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, which is one God,
  without end. Amen.
 </span></block>

  After having entered in by the way
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>32
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And now, behold, my beloved brethren, I suppose that ye ponder
  somewhat in your hearts concerning that which ye should do after
  ye have entered in by the way. But,
  behold, why do ye ponder these things in your hearts?
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>Do ye not remember that I said unto you
  that after ye had received the Holy Ghost ye could speak with the
  tongue of angels? And now, how could ye speak with the tongue of
  angels save it were by the Holy Ghost?
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>Angels speak by the power of the Holy
  Ghost; wherefore, they speak the words of Christ.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  The doctrine of Christ
 </span></heading>

 <block><span>
  Wherefore, I said unto you:
  </span><quote><span>
   Feast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ
   will tell you all things what ye should do.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Wherefore, now after I have spoken these words, if ye cannot
  understand them it will be because ye ask not, neither do ye
  knock; wherefore, ye are not brought into the light, but must
  perish in the dark.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>For behold, again I say unto you that if ye will enter in by
  the way, and receive the Holy Ghost, it will show unto you all
  things what ye should do.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>Behold, this is the doctrine of Christ, and there will be no
  more doctrine given until after he shall manifest himself unto
  you in the flesh. And when he shall manifest himself unto you in
  the flesh, the things which he shall say unto you shall ye
  observe to do.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>And now I, Nephi, cannot say more; the Spirit stoppeth mine
  utterance, and I am left to mourn because of the unbelief, and
  the wickedness, and the ignorance, and the stiffneckedness of
  men; for they will not search knowledge, nor understand great
  knowledge, when it is given unto them in plainness, even as
  plain as word can be.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>And now, my beloved brethren, I perceive that ye ponder still
  in your hearts; and it grieveth me that I must speak concerning
  this thing. For if ye would hearken unto the Spirit which
  teacheth a man to pray ye would know that ye must pray; for the
  evil spirit teacheth not a man to pray, but teacheth him that he
  must not pray.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>But behold, I say unto you that ye must pray always, and not
  faint; that ye must not perform any thing unto the Lord save in
  the first place ye shall pray unto the Father in the name of
  Christ, that he will consecrate thy performance unto thee, that
  thy performance may be for the welfare of thy soul.
 </span></block>

 <blockheading><span>
  NEPHI’S CONCLUSION
 </span></blockheading>
 <chapter>33
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And now I, Nephi, cannot write all the things which were taught
  among my people; neither am I mighty in writing, like unto
  speaking; for when a man speaketh by the power of the Holy Ghost
  the power of the Holy Ghost carrieth it unto the hearts of the
  children of men.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>But behold, there are many that harden their hearts against the
  Holy Spirit, that it hath no place in them; wherefore, they cast
  many things away which are written and esteem them as things of
  naught.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>But I, Nephi, have written what I have written, and I esteem it
  as of great worth, and especially unto my people.
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  For I pray continually for them by day, and mine eyes water my
  pillow by night, because of them; and I cry unto my God in faith,
  and I know that he will hear my cry.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And
  I know that the Lord God will consecrate my prayers for the gain
  of my people.
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  And the words which I have written in weakness will be made strong
  unto them; for it persuadeth them to do good; it maketh known unto
  them of their fathers; and it speaketh of Jesus, and persuadeth
  them to believe in him, and to endure to the end, which is life
  eternal.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And it speaketh harshly against
  sin, according to the plainness of the truth; wherefore, no man
  will be angry at the words which I have written save he shall be
  of the spirit of the devil.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>I glory in plainness; I glory in truth; I glory in my Jesus,
  for he hath redeemed my soul from hell.
  </span><dot>
   <verse>7</verse><span>I have charity for my people, and great faith in Christ that I shall meet many souls spotless at his judgment-seat.</span></dot>
  <dot>
   <verse>8</verse><span>I have charity for the Jew—I say Jew, because I mean them from whence I came.</span></dot>
  <dot>
   <verse>9</verse><span>I also have charity for the Gentiles.</span></dot>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  But behold, for none of these can I hope except they shall:
  </span><dot><span>be reconciled unto Christ, and</span></dot>
  <dot><span>enter into the narrow gate, and</span></dot>
  <dot><span>walk in the strait path which leads to life, and</span></dot>
  <dot><span>continue in the path until the end of the day of probation.</span></dot>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>And now, my beloved brethren, and also Jew, and all ye ends of the
  earth, hearken unto these words and believe in Christ; and if ye
  believe not in these words believe in Christ. And if ye shall
  believe in Christ ye will believe in these words, for they are the
  words of Christ, and he hath given them unto me; and they teach all
  men that they should do good.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And if they are not the words of Christ, judge ye—for Christ will
  show unto you with power and great glory that they are his words at
  the last day; and you and I shall stand face to face before his bar;
  and ye shall know that I have been commanded of him to write these
  things, notwithstanding my weakness.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And I pray the Father in the name of Christ that many of us, if not
  all, may be saved in his kingdom at that great and last day.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>And now, my beloved brethren, all those who are of the house of
  Israel, and all ye ends of the earth, I speak unto you as the voice
  of one crying from the dust. Farewell until that great day shall
  come.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And you that will not partake of the goodness of God, and respect
  the words of the Jews, and also my words, and the words which shall
  proceed forth out of the mouth of the Lamb of God, behold, I bid you
  an everlasting farewell, for these words shall condemn you at the
  last day.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>For what I seal on earth shall be brought against you at the
  judgment bar; for thus has the Lord commanded me, and I must obey.
  Amen.
