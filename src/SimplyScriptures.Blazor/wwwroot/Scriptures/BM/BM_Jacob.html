 <chapter>1</chapter>

 <block>
  <italic><span>The words of his preaching unto his brethren. He confounds a man who seeketh to overthrow the doctrine of Christ.</span></italic>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>A few words concerning the history of the people of Nephi. For
  behold, it came to pass that fifty and five years had passed away
  from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem; wherefore, Nephi gave me,
  Jacob, a commandment concerning the small plates upon which these
  things are engraven.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And he gave me, Jacob, a commandment that I should write upon these
  plates a few of the things which I considered to be most precious;
  that I should not touch, save it were lightly, concerning the
  history of this people which are called the people of Nephi.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>For he said that the history of his people should be engraven upon
  his other plates, and that I should preserve these plates and hand
  them down unto my seed, from generation to generation.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And if there were preaching which was sacred, or revelation which
  was great, or prophesying, that I should engraven the heads of them
  upon these plates, and touch upon them as much as it were possible,
  for Christ’s sake, and for the sake of our people.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>For because of faith and great anxiety, it truly had been made
  manifest unto us concerning our people what things should happen
  unto them.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And we also had many revelations, and the spirit of much prophecy;
  wherefore, we knew of Christ and his kingdom, which should
  come.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>Wherefore we labored diligently among our people, that we might
  persuade them to come unto Christ, and partake of the goodness of
  God, that they might enter into his rest, lest by any means he
  should swear in his wrath they should not enter in, as in the
  provocation in the days of temptation while the children of Israel
  were in the wilderness.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>Wherefore, we would to God that we could persuade all men not to
  rebel against God, to provoke him to anger, but that all men would
  believe in Christ, and view his death, and suffer his cross and bear
  the shame of the world.
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  Wherefore, I, Jacob, take it upon me to fulfil the commandment of my
  brother Nephi.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>Now Nephi began to be old, and he saw that he must soon die;
  wherefore, he anointed a man to be a king and a ruler over his
  people now, according to the reigns of the kings.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>The people having loved Nephi exceedingly, he having been a great
  protector for them, having wielded the sword of Laban in their
  defence, and having labored in all his days for their welfare—</span><verse>11</verse><span>wherefore, the people were desirous to retain in remembrance his
  name. And whoso should reign in his stead were called by the people,
  second Nephi, third Nephi, and so forth, according to the reigns of
  the kings; and thus they were called by the people, let them be of
  whatever name they would.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And it came to pass that Nephi died.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>Now the people which were not Lamanites were Nephites;
  nevertheless, they were called Nephites, Jacobites, Josephites,
  Zoramites, Lamanites, Lemuelites, and Ishmaelites.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>But I, Jacob, shall not hereafter distinguish them by these names,
  but I shall call them Lamanites that seek to destroy the people of
  Nephi, and those who are friendly to Nephi I shall call Nephites, or
  the people of Nephi, according to the reigns of the kings.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And now it came to pass that the people of Nephi, under the reign
  of the second king, began to grow hard in their hearts, and indulge
  themselves somewhat in wicked practices, such as like unto David of
  old desiring many wives and concubines, and also Solomon, his son.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>Yea, and they
  also began to search much gold and silver, and began to be lifted up
  somewhat in pride.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>Wherefore I, Jacob, gave unto them these words as I taught them in
  the temple, having first obtained mine errand from the Lord.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>For I, Jacob, and my brother Joseph had been consecrated priests
  and teachers of this people, by the hand of Nephi.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And we did magnify our office unto the Lord, taking upon us the
  responsibility, answering the sins of the people upon our own heads
  if we did not teach them the word of God with all diligence;
  wherefore, by laboring with our might their blood might not come
  upon our garments; otherwise their blood would come upon our
  garments, and we would not be found spotless at the last day.

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>The words which Jacob, the brother of Nephi, spake unto the people
  of Nephi, after the death of Nephi:
  </span><quote>
   <block>
    <verse>2</verse><span>Now, my beloved brethren, I, Jacob, according to the responsibility
    which I am under to God, to magnify mine office with soberness, and
    that I might rid my garments of your sins, I come up into the temple
    this day that I might declare unto you the word of God.
    </span><verse>3</verse><span>And ye yourselves know that I have hitherto been diligent in the
    office of my calling; but I this day am weighed down with much more
    desire and anxiety for the welfare of your souls than I have
    hitherto been.
    </span><verse>4</verse><span>For behold, as yet, ye have been obedient unto the word of the
    Lord, which I have given unto you.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>5</verse><span>But behold, hearken ye unto me, and know that by the help of the
    all-powerful Creator of heaven and earth I can tell you concerning
    your thoughts, how that ye are beginning to labor in sin, which sin
    appeareth very abominable unto me, yea, and abominable unto God.
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>Yea, it grieveth my soul and causeth me to shrink with shame before
    the presence of my Maker, that I must testify unto you concerning
    the wickedness of your hearts.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>7</verse><span>And also it grieveth me that I must use so much boldness of speech
    concerning you, before your wives and your children, many of whose
    feelings are exceedingly tender and chaste and delicate before God,
    which thing is pleasing unto God;
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>and it supposeth me that they have come up hither to hear the
    pleasing word of God, yea, the word which healeth the wounded soul.
    </span><verse>9</verse><span>Wherefore, it burdeneth my soul that I should be constrained,
    because of the strict commandment which I have received from God, to
    admonish you according to your crimes, to enlarge the wounds of
    those who are already wounded, instead of consoling and healing
    their wounds; and those who have not been wounded, instead of
    feasting upon the pleasing word of God have daggers placed to pierce
    their souls and wound their delicate minds.
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>But, notwithstanding the greatness of the task, I must do according
    to the strict commands of God, and tell you concerning your
    wickedness and abominations, in the presence of the pure in heart,
    and the broken heart, and under the glance of the piercing eye of
    the Almighty God.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>11</verse><span>Wherefore, I must tell you the truth according to the plainness of
    the word of God. For behold, as I inquired of the Lord, thus came
    the word unto me, saying:</span><quote><span>
     Jacob, get thou up into the temple on the morrow, and declare the word
     which I shall give thee unto this people.

  Pride and riches
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <quote>
   <block>
    <verse>12</verse><span>And now behold, my brethren, this is the word which I declare unto
    you, that many of you have begun to search for gold, and for silver,
    and for all manner of precious ores, in the which this land, which
    is a land of promise unto you and to your seed, doth abound most
    plentifully.
    </span><verse>13</verse><span>And the hand of providence hath smiled upon you most pleasingly,
    that you have obtained many riches; and because some of you have
    obtained more abundantly than that of your brethren ye are lifted up
    in the pride of your hearts, and wear stiff necks and high heads
    because of the costliness of your apparel, and persecute your
    brethren because ye suppose that ye are better than they.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>14</verse><span>And now, my brethren, do ye suppose that God justifieth you in this
    thing? Behold, I say unto you nay, but he condemneth you, and if ye
    persist in these things his judgments must speedily come unto you.
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>O that he would show you that he can pierce you, and with one
    glance of his eye he can smite you to the dust!
    </span><verse>16</verse><span>O that he would rid you from this iniquity and abomination. And, O
    that ye would listen unto the word of his commands, and let not this
    pride of your hearts destroy your souls!</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>17</verse><span>Think of your brethren like unto yourselves, and be familiar with
    all and free with your substance, that they may be rich like unto
    you.
    </span><verse>18</verse><span>But before ye seek for riches, seek ye for the kingdom of God.
    </span><verse>19</verse><span>And after ye have obtained a hope in Christ ye shall obtain riches
    if ye seek them; and ye will seek them for the intent to do good—to
    clothe the naked, and to feed the hungry, and to liberate the
    captive, and administer relief to the sick and the afflicted.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>20</verse><span>And now, my brethren, I have spoken unto you concerning pride; and
    those of you which have afflicted your neighbor and persecuted him
    because ye were proud in your hearts of the things which God hath
    given you, what say ye of it?
    </span><verse>21</verse><span>Do ye not suppose that such things are abominable unto him who
    created all flesh? And the one being is as precious in his sight as
    the other. And all flesh is of the dust. And for the selfsame end
    hath he created them, that they should keep his commandments and
    glorify him forever.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>22</verse><span>And now I make an end of speaking unto you concerning this pride.
    And were it not that I must speak unto you concerning a grosser
    crime, my heart would rejoice exceedingly because of you.
    </span><verse>23</verse><span>But the word of God burdens me because of your grosser
    crimes.</span></block>

   <block><span>
    For behold, thus saith the Lord:
    </span><quote><span>
     This people begin to wax in iniquity; they understand not the
     scriptures, for they seek to excuse themselves in committing whoredoms
     because of the things which were written concerning David, and Solomon
     his son.
     </span><verse>24</verse><span>Behold, David and Solomon truly
     had many wives and concubines, which thing was abominable before me,
     saith the Lord.
     </span><verse>25</verse><span>Wherefore, thus saith the
     Lord, I have led this people forth out of the land of Jerusalem, by
     the power of mine arm, that I might raise up unto me a righteous
     branch from the fruit of the loins of Joseph.
     </span><verse>26</verse><span>Wherefore, I the Lord God will not suffer
     that this people shall do like unto them of old.

 <block>
  <quote>
   <verse>27</verse><span>Wherefore, my brethren, hear me, and hearken to the word of the
   Lord:</span><quote>
    <block><span>
     For there shall not any man among you have save it be one wife; and
     concubines he shall have none;
     </span><verse>28</verse><span>for I, the
     Lord God, delight in the chastity of women. And whoredoms are an
     abomination before me; thus saith the Lord of Hosts.
     </span><verse>29</verse><span>Wherefore, this people shall keep my commandments, saith the Lord
     of Hosts, or cursed be the land for their sakes.
     </span><verse>30</verse><span>For if I will, saith the Lord of Hosts,
     raise up seed unto me, I will command my people; otherwise they shall
     hearken unto these things.</span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>31</verse><span>For behold, I, the Lord, have seen the sorrow and heard the
     mourning of the daughters of my people in the land of Jerusalem,
     yea, and in all the lands of my people, because of the wickedness
     and abominations of their husbands.
     </span><verse>32</verse><span>And I will not suffer, saith the Lord of Hosts, that the cries of
     the fair daughters of this people, which I have led out of the land
     of Jerusalem, shall come up unto me against the men of my people,
     saith the Lord of Hosts.
     </span><verse>33</verse><span>For they shall not lead away captive the daughters of my people
     because of their tenderness, save I shall visit them with a sore
     curse, even unto destruction; for they shall not commit whoredoms
     like unto them of old, saith the Lord of Hosts.</span></block>

   <verse>34</verse><span>And now behold, my brethren, ye know that these commandments were
   given to our father, Lehi; wherefore, ye have known them before; and
   ye have come unto great condemnation; for ye have done these things
   which ye ought not to have done.
   </span><verse>35</verse><span>Behold, ye have done greater iniquities than the Lamanites, our
   brethren. Ye have broken the hearts of your tender wives and lost
   the confidence of your children because of your bad examples before
   them; and the sobbings of their hearts ascend up to God against you.
   And because of the strictness of the word of God, which cometh down
   against you, many hearts died, pierced with deep wounds.</span></quote>

   <verse>1</verse><span>But behold, I, Jacob, would speak unto you that are pure in heart.
   Look unto God with firmness of mind, and pray unto him with
   exceeding faith, and he will console you in your afflictions, and he
   will plead your cause, and send down justice upon those who seek
   your destruction.
   </span><verse>2</verse><span>O all ye that are pure in heart, lift up your heads and receive the

    <verse>3</verse><span>But, wo, wo unto you that are not pure in heart, that are filthy
    this day before God; for except ye repent the land is cursed for
    your sakes; and the Lamanites, which are not filthy like unto you,
    nevertheless they are cursed with a sore cursing, shall scourge you
    even unto destruction.
    </span><verse>4</verse><span>And the time speedily cometh that except ye repent they shall
    possess the land of your inheritance, and the Lord God will lead
    away the righteous out from among you.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>5</verse><span>Behold, the Lamanites, your brethren whom ye hate because of their
    filthiness and the cursing which hath come upon their skins, are
    more righteous than you; for they have not forgotten the commandment
    of the Lord which was given unto our father— that they should have
    save it were one wife and concubines they should have none, and
    there should not be whoredoms committed among them.
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>And now, this commandment they observe to keep; wherefore, because
    of this observance, in keeping this commandment, the Lord God will
    not destroy them, but will be merciful unto them and one day they
    shall become a blessed people.
    </span><verse>7</verse><span>Behold, their husbands love their wives, and their wives love their
    husbands; and their husbands and their wives love their children;
    and their unbelief and their hatred towards you is because of the
    iniquity of their fathers; wherefore, how much better are you than
    they in the sight of your great Creator?</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>8</verse><span>O my brethren, I fear that unless ye shall repent of your sins that
    their skins will be whiter than yours when ye shall be brought with
    them before the throne of God.
    </span><verse>9</verse><span>Wherefore, a commandment I give unto you, which is the word of God,
    that ye revile no more against them because of the darkness of their
    skins; neither shall ye revile against them because of their
    filthiness; but ye shall remember your own filthiness, and remember
    that their filthiness came because of their fathers.
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>Wherefore, ye shall remember your children, how that ye have
    grieved their hearts because of the example that ye have set before
    them; and also, remember that ye may, because of your filthiness,
    bring your children unto destruction, and their sins be heaped upon
    your heads at the last day.</span></block>

    <indent><span>and loose yourselves from the pains of hell</span></indent><span>

  <verse>12</verse><span>And now I, Jacob, spake many more things unto the people of Nephi,
  warning them against fornication and lasciviousness, and every kind
  of sin, telling them the awful consequences of them.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And a hundredth part of the proceedings of this people, which now
  began to be numerous, cannot be written upon these plates; but many
  of their proceedings are written upon the larger plates, and their
  wars, and their contentions, and the reigns of their kings.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>These plates are called the plates of Jacob, and they were made by
  the hand of Nephi. And I make an end of speaking these words.

  JACOB’S PROPHECY
 </span></blockheading>
 <chapter>4
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Now behold, it came to pass that I, Jacob, having ministered much
  unto my people in word, (and I cannot write but a little of my
  words, because of the difficulty of engraving our words upon plates)
  and we know that the things which we write upon plates must remain;
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>but whatsoever things we write upon anything save it be upon plates
  must perish and vanish away; but we can write a few words upon
  plates, which will give our children, and also our beloved brethren,
  a small degree of knowledge concerning us, or concerning their
  fathers—</span><verse>3</verse><span>now in this thing we do rejoice; and we labor diligently to
  engraven these words upon plates, hoping that our beloved brethren
  and our children will receive them with thankful hearts, and look
  upon them that they may learn with joy and not with sorrow, neither
  with contempt, concerning their first parents.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>For, for this intent have we written these things, that they may
  know that we knew of Christ, and we had a hope of his glory many
  hundred years before his coming; and not only we ourselves had a
  hope of his glory, but also all the holy prophets which were before
  us.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>Behold, they believed in Christ and worshiped the Father in his
  name, and also we worship the Father in his name.
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  And for this intent we keep the law of Moses, it pointing our souls to
  him; and for this cause it is sanctified unto us for righteousness,
  even as it was accounted unto Abraham in the wilderness to be obedient
  unto the commands of God in offering up his son Isaac, which is a
  similitude of God and his Only Begotten Son.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>Wherefore, we search the prophets, and we have many revelations and
  the spirit of prophecy; and having all these witnesses we obtain a
  hope, and our faith becometh unshaken, insomuch that we truly can
  command in the name of Jesus and the very trees
  obey us, or the mountains, or the waves of the sea.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>Nevertheless, the Lord God showeth us our
  weakness that we may know that it is by his grace, and his great
  condescensions unto the children of men, that we have power to do
  these things.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>Behold, great and marvelous are the works of the Lord. How
  unsearchable are the depths of the mysteries of him; and it is
  impossible that man should find out all his ways. And no man knoweth
  of his ways save it be revealed unto him; wherefore, brethren,
  despise not the revelations of God.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>For behold, by the power of his word man came upon the face of the
  earth, which earth was created by the power of his word. Wherefore,
  if God being able to speak and the world was, and to speak and man
  was created, O then, why not able to command the earth, or the
  workmanship of his hands upon the face of it, according to his will
  and pleasure?
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>Wherefore, brethren, seek not to counsel the Lord, but to take
  counsel from his hand. For behold, ye yourselves know that he
  counseleth in wisdom, and in justice, and in great mercy, over all
  his works.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>Wherefore, beloved brethren, be reconciled unto him through the
  atonement of Christ, his Only Begotten Son, and ye may obtain a
  resurrection, according to the power of the resurrection which is in
  Christ, and be presented as the
  first-fruits of Christ unto God, having faith, and obtained a good
  hope of glory in him before he manifesteth himself in the flesh.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>And now, beloved, marvel not that I tell you these things; for why
  not speak of the atonement of Christ, and attain to a perfect
  knowledge of him, as to attain to the knowledge of a resurrection
  and the world to come?
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>Behold, my brethren, he that prophesieth, let him prophesy to the
  understanding of men; for the Spirit speaketh the truth and lieth
  not. Wherefore, it speaketh of things as they really are, and of
  things as they really will be; wherefore, these things are
  manifested unto us plainly, for the salvation of our souls.
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  But behold, we are not witnesses alone in these things; for God also
  spake them unto prophets of old.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>But
  behold, the Jews were a stiffnecked people; and they despised the
  words of plainness, and killed the prophets, and sought for things
  that they could not understand. Wherefore, because of their blindness,
  which blindness came by looking beyond the mark, they must needs fall;
  for God hath taken away his plainness from them, and delivered unto
  them many things which they cannot understand, because they desired
  it. And because they desired it God hath done it, that they may
  stumble.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And now I, Jacob, am led on by the Spirit unto prophesying; for I
  perceive by the workings of the Spirit which is in me, that by the
  stumbling of the Jews they will reject the stone upon which they
  might build and have safe foundation.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>But behold, according to the scriptures, this stone shall become
  the great, and the last, and the only sure foundation, upon which
  the Jews can build.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>And now, my beloved, how is it possible that these, after having
  rejected the sure foundation, can ever build upon it, that it may
  become the head of their corner?
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>Behold, my beloved brethren, I will unfold this mystery unto you;
  if I do not, by any means, get shaken from my firmness in the
  Spirit, and stumble because of my over anxiety for you.

  THE ALLEGORY OF THE OLIVE TREES

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Behold, my brethren, do ye not remember to have read the words of
  the prophet Zenos, which he spake unto the house of Israel,
  saying:
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>Hearken, O ye house of Israel, and hear the words of me, a prophet
  of the Lord.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>For behold, thus saith the Lord: I will liken thee, O house of Israel,
  like unto a tame olive tree, which a man took and nourished in his
  vineyard.

  And it grew, and waxed old, and began to decay.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And it came to pass that the master of the
  vineyard went forth, and he saw that his olive tree began to decay;
  and he said, “I will prune it, and dig about it, and nourish it, that
  perhaps it may shoot forth young and tender branches, and it perish
  not.”

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>And it came to pass that he pruned it, and digged about it, and

  <verse>6</verse><span>And it came to pass that after many days it began to put forth
  somewhat a little, young and tender branches; but behold, the main
  top thereof began to perish.

  said unto his servant, “It grieveth me that I should lose this tree;
  wherefore, go and pluck the branches from a wild olive tree, and
  bring them hither unto me; and we will pluck off those main branches
  which are beginning to wither away, and we will cast them into the
  fire that they may be burned.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>And behold, saith the Lord of the vineyard, “I take away many of
  these young and tender branches, and I will graft them whithersoever
  I will; and it mattereth not that if it so be that the root of this
  tree will perish, I may preserve the fruit thereof unto myself;
  wherefore, I will take these young and tender branches, and I will
  graft them whithersoever I will.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>Take thou the branches of the wild olive tree, and graft them in,
  in the stead thereof; and these which I have plucked off I will cast
  into the fire and burn them, that they may not cumber the ground of
  my vineyard.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>And it came to pass that the servant of the Lord of the vineyard
  did according to the word of the Lord of the vineyard, and grafted
  in the branches of the wild olive tree.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And the Lord of the vineyard caused that it should be digged about,
  and pruned, and nourished, saying unto his servant, “It grieveth me
  that I should lose this tree; wherefore, that perhaps I might
  preserve the roots thereof that they perish not, that I might
  preserve them unto myself, I have done this thing.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>Wherefore, go thy way; watch the tree, and nourish it, according to
  my words.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And these will I place in the nethermost part of my vineyard,
  whithersoever I will, it mattereth not unto thee; and I do it that I
  may preserve unto myself the natural branches of the tree; and also,
  that I may lay up fruit thereof against the season, unto myself; for
  it grieveth me that I should lose this tree and the fruit
  thereof.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard went his way, and
  hid the natural branches of the tame olive tree in the nethermost
  parts of the vineyard, some in one and some in another, according to
  his will and pleasure.

  SECOND VISIT
 </span></blockheading>
 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And it came to pass that a long time passed away, and the Lord of
  the vineyard said unto his servant, “Come, let us go down into the
  vineyard, that we may labor in the vineyard.”
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard, and also the
  servant, went down into the vineyard to labor.
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  And it came to pass that the servant said unto his master, “Behold,
  look here; behold the tree.”
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And it came to
  pass that the Lord of the vineyard looked and beheld the tree in the
  which the wild olive branches had been grafted; and it had sprung
  forth and begun to bear fruit. And he beheld that it was good; and the
  fruit thereof was like unto the natural fruit.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>And he said unto the servant, “Behold, the branches of the wild
  tree have taken hold of the moisture of the root thereof, that the
  root thereof hath brought forth much strength; and because of the
  much strength of the root thereof the wild branches have brought
  forth tame fruit. Now, if we had not grafted in these branches, the
  tree thereof would have perished. And now, behold, I shall lay up
  much fruit, which the tree thereof hath brought forth; and the fruit
  thereof I shall lay up against the season, unto mine own
  self.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>And it came to pass that the Lord of the
  vineyard said unto the servant, “Come, let us go to the nethermost
  part of the vineyard, and behold if the natural branches of the tree
  have not brought forth much fruit also, that I may lay up of the fruit
  thereof against the season, unto mine own self.”
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And it came to pass that they went forth
  whither the
  </span><under>
   <printer><span>master of the vineyard</span></printer><span>master</span></under><span>
  had hid the natural branches of the tree,
  and he said unto the servant, “Behold these!” And he beheld the first
  that it had brought forth much fruit; and he beheld also that it was
  good. And he said unto the servant, “Take of the fruit thereof, and
  lay it up against the season, that I may preserve it unto mine own
  self; for behold,” said he, “this long time have I nourished it, and
  it hath brought forth much fruit.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>And it came to pass that the servant said unto his master, “How
  comest thou hither to plant this tree, or this branch of the tree?
  For behold, it was the poorest spot in all the land of thy
  vineyard.”
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>And the Lord of the vineyard said unto him, “Counsel me not; I knew
  that it was a poor spot of ground; wherefore, I said unto thee, ‘I
  have nourished it this long time,’ and thou beholdest that it hath
  brought forth much fruit.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard said unto his
  servant, “Look hither; behold I have planted another branch of the
  tree also; and thou knowest that this spot of ground was poorer than
  the first. But, behold the tree. I have nourished it this long time,
  and it hath brought forth much fruit; therefore, gather it, and lay
  it up against the season, that I may preserve it unto mine own
  self.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard said again unto
  his servant, “Look hither, and behold another branch also, which I
  have planted; behold that I have nourished it also, and it hath
  brought forth fruit.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>25</verse><span>And he said unto the servant, “Look hither and behold the last.
  Behold, this have I planted in a good spot of ground; and I have
  nourished it this long time, and only a part of the tree hath
  brought forth tame fruit, and the other part of the tree hath
  brought forth wild fruit; behold, I have nourished this tree like
  unto the others.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>26</verse><span>And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard said unto the
  servant, “Pluck off the branches that have not brought forth good
  fruit, and cast them into the fire.”
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>But behold, the servant said unto him, “Let us prune it, and dig
  about it, and nourish it a little longer, that perhaps it may bring
  forth good fruit unto thee, that thou canst lay it up against the
  season.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>28</verse><span>And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard and the servant
  of the Lord of the vineyard did nourish all the fruit of the
  vineyard.

  THIRD VISIT
 </span></blockheading>
 <block>
  <verse>29</verse><span>And it came to pass that a long time had passed away, and the Lord
  of the vineyard said unto his servant, “Come, let us go down into
  the vineyard, that we may labor again in the vineyard. For behold,
  the time draweth near, and the end soon cometh; wherefore, I
  must lay up fruit against the season, unto mine own self.”
  </span><verse>30</verse><span>And it came to pass that the Lord of the
  vineyard and the servant went down into the vineyard.

  Wild branches
 </span></heading>

 <block><span>
  And they came to the tree whose natural branches had been broken off,
  and the wild branches had been grafted in; and behold all sorts of
  fruit did cumber the tree.
  </span><verse>31</verse><span>And it came to
  pass that the Lord of the vineyard did taste of the fruit, every sort
  according to its number. And the Lord of the vineyard said, “Behold,
  this long time have we nourished this tree, and I have laid up unto
  myself against the season much fruit.
  </span><verse>32</verse><span>But
  behold, this time it has brought forth much fruit, and there is none
  of it which is good. And behold, there are all kinds of bad fruit; and
  it profits me nothing, notwithstanding all our labor; and now it
  grieveth me that I should lose this tree.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>33</verse><span>And the Lord of the vineyard said unto the servant, “What shall we
  do unto the tree, that I may preserve again good fruit thereof unto
  mine own self?”
  </span><verse>34</verse><span>And the servant said unto his master, “Behold, because thou didst
  graft in the branches of the wild olive tree they have nourished the
  roots, that they are alive and they have not perished; wherefore
  thou beholdest that they are yet good.”
  </span><verse>35</verse><span>And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard said unto his
  servant, “The tree profiteth me nothing, and the roots thereof
  profit me nothing so long as it shall bring forth evil fruit.
  </span><verse>36</verse><span>Nevertheless, I know that the roots are good, and for mine own
  purpose I have preserved them; and because of their much strength
  they have hitherto brought forth, from the wild branches, good
  fruit.
  </span><verse>37</verse><span>But behold, the wild branches have grown and have overrun the roots
  thereof; and because that the wild branches have overcome the roots
  thereof it hath brought forth much evil fruit; and because that it
  hath brought forth so much evil fruit thou beholdest that it
  beginneth to perish; and it will soon become ripened, that it may be
  cast into the fire, except we should do something for it to preserve
  it.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>38</verse><span>And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard said unto his
  servant, “Let us go down into the nethermost parts of the vineyard,
  and behold if the natural branches have also brought forth evil
  fruit.”
  </span><verse>39</verse><span>And it came to pass that they went down into the nethermost parts
  of the vineyard.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  Natural branches
 </span></heading>

 <block><span>
  And it came to pass that they beheld that the fruit of the natural
  branches had become corrupt also; yea, the first and the second and
  also the last; and they had all become corrupt.
  </span><verse>40</verse><span>And the wild fruit of the last had overcome
  that part of the tree which brought forth good fruit, even that the
  branch had withered away and died.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>41</verse><span>And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard wept, and said
  unto the servant, “What could I have done more for my vineyard?
  </span><verse>42</verse><span>Behold, I knew that all the fruit of the vineyard, save it were
  these, had become corrupted. And now these which have once brought
  forth good fruit have also become corrupted; and now all the trees
  of my vineyard are good for nothing save it be to be hewn down and
  cast into the fire.
  </span><verse>43</verse><span>And behold this last, whose branch hath withered away, I did plant
  in a good spot of ground; yea, even that which was choice unto me
  above all other parts of the land of my vineyard.
  </span><verse>44</verse><span>And thou beheldest that I also cut down that which cumbered this
  spot of ground, that I might plant this tree in the stead thereof.
  </span><verse>45</verse><span>And thou beheldest that a part thereof brought forth good fruit,
  and a part thereof brought forth wild fruit; and because I plucked
  not the branches thereof and cast them into the fire, behold, they
  have overcome the good branch that it hath withered away.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>46</verse><span>“And now, behold, notwithstanding all the care which we have taken
  of my vineyard, the trees thereof have become corrupted, that they
  bring forth no good fruit; and these I had hoped to preserve, to
  have laid up fruit thereof against the season, unto mine own self.
  But, behold, they have become like unto the wild olive tree, and
  they are of no worth but to be hewn down and cast into the fire; and
  it grieveth me that I should lose them.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>47</verse><span>“But what could I have done more in my vineyard? Have I slackened
  mine hand, that I have not nourished it? Nay, I have nourished it,
  and I have digged about it, and I have pruned it, and I have dunged
  it; and I have stretched forth mine hand almost all the day long,
  and the end draweth nigh. And it grieveth me that I should hew down
  all the trees of my vineyard, and cast them into the fire that they
  should be burned. Who is it that has corrupted my vineyard?”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>48</verse><span>And it came to pass that the servant said unto his master, “Is it
  not the loftiness of thy vineyard—have not the branches thereof
  overcome the roots which are good? And because the branches have
  overcome the roots thereof, behold they grew faster than the
  strength of the roots, taking strength unto themselves. Behold, I
  say, is not this the cause that the trees of thy vineyard have
  become corrupted?”
 </span></block>

 <blockheading><span>
  FOURTH VISIT
 </span></blockheading>
 <block>
  <verse>49</verse><span>And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard said unto the
  servant, “Let us go to and hew down the trees of the vineyard and
  cast them into the fire, that they shall not cumber the ground of my
  vineyard, for I have done all. What could I have done more for my
  vineyard?”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>50</verse><span>But, behold, the servant said unto the Lord of the vineyard, “Spare
  it a little longer.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>51</verse><span>And the Lord said, “Yea, I will spare it a little longer, for it
  grieveth me that I should lose the trees of my vineyard.
  </span><verse>52</verse><span>Wherefore, let us take of the branches of these which I have
  planted in the nethermost parts of my vineyard, and let us graft
  them into the tree from whence they came; and let us pluck from the
  tree those branches whose fruit is most bitter, and graft in the
  natural branches of the tree in the stead thereof.
  </span><verse>53</verse><span>And this will I do that the tree may not perish, that, perhaps, I
  may preserve unto myself the roots thereof for mine own purpose.
  </span><verse>54</verse><span>And, behold, the roots of the natural branches of the tree which I
  planted whithersoever I would are yet alive; wherefore, that I may
  preserve them also for mine own purpose, I will take of the branches
  of this tree, and I will graft them in unto them. Yea, I will graft
  in unto them the branches of their mother tree, that I may preserve
  the roots also unto mine own self, that when they shall be
  sufficiently strong perhaps they may bring forth good fruit unto me,
  and I may yet have glory in the fruit of my vineyard.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>55</verse><span>And it came to pass that they took from the natural tree which had
  become wild, and grafted in unto the natural trees, which also had
  become wild.
  </span><verse>56</verse><span>And they also took of the natural trees which had become wild, and
  grafted into their mother tree.
  </span><verse>57</verse><span>And the Lord of the vineyard said unto the servant, “Pluck not the
  wild branches from the trees, save it be those which are most
  bitter; and in them ye shall graft according to that which I have
  said.
  </span><verse>58</verse><span>And we will nourish again the trees of the vineyard, and we will
  trim up the branches thereof; and we will pluck from the trees those
  branches which are ripened, that must perish, and cast them into the
  fire.
  </span><verse>59</verse><span>And this I do that, perhaps, the roots thereof may take strength
  because of their goodness; and because of the change of the
  branches, that the good may overcome the evil.
  </span><verse>60</verse><span>And because that I have preserved the natural branches and the
  roots thereof, and that I have grafted in the natural branches again
  into their mother tree, and have preserved the roots of their mother
  tree, that, perhaps, the
  trees of my vineyard may bring forth again good fruit; and that I may
  have joy again in the fruit of my vineyard, and, perhaps, that I may
  rejoice exceedingly that I have preserved the roots and the branches
  of the first fruit.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>61</verse><span>“Wherefore, go to, and call servants, that we may labor diligently
  with our might in the vineyard, that we may prepare the way, that I
  may bring forth again the natural fruit, which natural fruit is good
  and the most precious above all other fruit.
  </span><verse>62</verse><span>Wherefore, let us go to and labor with our might this last time,
  for behold the end draweth nigh, and this is for the last time that
  I shall prune my vineyard.
  </span><verse>63</verse><span>Graft in the branches; begin at the last that they may be first,
  and that the first may be last, and dig about the trees, both old
  and young, the first and the last; and the last and the first, that
  all may be nourished once again for the last time.
  </span><verse>64</verse><span>Wherefore, dig about them, and prune them, and dung them once more,
  for the last time, for the end draweth nigh.”
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  “And if it be so that these last grafts shall grow, and bring forth
  the natural fruit, then shall ye prepare the way for them, that they
  may grow.
  </span><verse>65</verse><span>And as they begin to grow ye
  shall clear away the branches which bring forth bitter fruit,
  according to the strength of the good and the size thereof; and ye
  shall not clear away the bad thereof all at once, lest the roots
  thereof should be too strong for the graft, and the graft thereof
  shall perish, and I lose the trees of my vineyard.
  </span><verse>66</verse><span>For it grieveth me that I should lose the
  trees of my vineyard; wherefore ye shall clear away the bad according
  as the good shall grow, that the root and the top may be equal in
  strength, until the good shall overcome the bad, and the bad be hewn
  down and cast into the fire, that they cumber not the ground of my
  vineyard; and thus will I sweep away the bad out of my vineyard.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>67</verse><span>“And the branches of the natural tree will I graft in again into
  the natural tree;
  </span><verse>68</verse><span>and the branches of the natural tree will I graft into the natural
  branches of the tree; and thus will I bring them together again,
  that they shall bring forth the natural fruit, and they shall be
  one.
  </span><verse>69</verse><span>And the bad shall be cast away, yea, even out of all the land of my
  vineyard; for behold, only this once will I prune my
  vineyard.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>70</verse><span>And it came to pass that the Lord of the
  vineyard sent his servant; and the servant went and did as the Lord
  had commanded him, and brought other servants; and they were few.
  </span><verse>71</verse><span>And the Lord of the vineyard said unto
  them, “Go to, and labor in the vineyard, with your might. For behold,
  this is the last time that I shall nourish my vineyard; for the end is
  nigh at hand, and the season speedily cometh; and if ye labor with
  your might with me ye shall have joy in the fruit which I shall lay up
  unto myself against the time which will soon come.”
  </span><verse>72</verse><span>And it came to pass that the servants did
  </span><under>
   <printer><span>go to it</span></printer><span>go</span></under><span>
  and labor with their mights; and the Lord of the vineyard
  labored also with them; and they did obey the commandments of the Lord
  of the vineyard in all things.
 </span></block>

 <blockheading><span>
  CONCLUSION
 </span></blockheading>
 <block>
  <verse>73</verse><span>And there began to be the natural fruit again in the vineyard; and
  the natural branches began to grow and thrive exceedingly; and the
  wild branches began to be plucked off and to be cast away; and they
  did keep the root and the top thereof equal, according to the
  strength thereof.
  </span><verse>74</verse><span>And thus they labored, with all diligence, according to the
  commandments of the Lord of the vineyard, even until the bad had
  been cast away out of the vineyard, and the Lord had preserved unto
  himself that the trees had become again the natural fruit; and they
  became like unto one body; and the fruits were equal; and the Lord
  of the vineyard had preserved unto himself the natural fruit, which
  was most precious unto him from the beginning.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>75</verse><span>And it came to pass that when the Lord of the vineyard saw that his
  fruit was good, and that his vineyard was no more corrupt, he called
  up his servants, and said unto them, “Behold, for this last time
  have we nourished my vineyard; and thou beholdest that I have done
  according to my will; and I have preserved the natural fruit, that
  it is good, even like as it was in the beginning. And blessed art
  thou; for because ye have been diligent in laboring with me in my
  vineyard, and have kept my commandments, and have brought unto me
  again the natural fruit, that my vineyard is no more corrupted, and
  the bad is cast away, behold ye shall have joy with me because of
  the fruit of my vineyard.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>76</verse><span>“For behold, for a long time will I lay up of the fruit of my
  vineyard unto mine own self against the season, which speedily
  cometh; and for the last time have I nourished my vineyard, and
  pruned it, and dug about it, and dunged it; wherefore I will lay up
  unto mine own self of the fruit, for a long time, according to that
  which I have spoken.
  </span><verse>77</verse><span>And when the time cometh that evil fruit shall again come into my
  vineyard, then will I cause the good and the bad to be gathered; and
  the good will I preserve unto myself, and the bad will I cast away
  into its own place. And then cometh the season and the end; and my
  vineyard will I cause to be burned with fire.”

  JACOB’S PROPHECY
 </span></blockheading>
 <chapter>6
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And now, behold, my brethren, as I said unto you that I would
  prophesy, behold, this is my prophecy—that the things which this
  prophet Zenos spake, concerning the house of Israel, in the which he
  likened them unto a tame olive tree, must surely come to pass.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And the day that he shall set his hand again the second time to
  recover his people, is the day, yea, even the last time, that the
  servants of the Lord shall go forth in his power, to nourish and
  prune his vineyard; and after that the end soon cometh.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>And how blessed are they who have labored diligently in his
  vineyard; and how cursed are they who shall be cast out into their
  own place! And the world shall be burned with fire.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And how merciful is our God unto us, for he remembereth the house
  of Israel, both roots and branches; and he stretches forth his hands
  unto them all the day long; and they are a stiffnecked and a
  gainsaying people; but as many as will not harden their hearts shall
  be saved in the kingdom of God.

  Call to repent

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, I beseech of you in words of
  soberness that ye would repent, and come with full purpose of heart,
  and cleave unto God as he cleaveth unto you. And while his arm of
  mercy is extended towards you in the light of the day, harden not
  your hearts.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>Yea, today, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your
  hearts.
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  For why will ye die?
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>For behold, after ye
  have been nourished by the good word of God all the day long, will ye
  bring forth evil fruit, that ye must be hewn down and cast into the
  fire?
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>Behold, will ye reject these words?
  Will ye reject the words of the prophets; and will ye reject all the
  words which have been spoken concerning Christ, after so many have
  spoken concerning him; and deny the good word of Christ, and the power
  of God, and the gift of the Holy Ghost, and quench the Holy Spirit,
  and make a mock of the great plan of redemption, which hath been laid
  for you?
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>Know ye not that if ye will do these things, that the power of the
  redemption and the resurrection, which is in Christ, will bring you
  to stand with shame and awful guilt before the bar of God?
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And according to the power of justice, for justice cannot be
  denied, ye must go away into that lake of fire and brimstone, whose
  flames are unquenchable, and whose smoke ascendeth up forever and
  ever, which lake of fire and brimstone is endless torment.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>O then,
  my beloved brethren, repent ye, and enter in at the strait gate, and
  continue in the way which is narrow, until ye shall obtain eternal
  life.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>O be wise; what can I say more?
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>Finally, I bid you farewell, until I shall meet you before the

  and fear. Amen.

 <chapter>7
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And now it came to pass after some years had passed away, there
  came a man among the people of Nephi, whose name was Sherem.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And it came to pass that he began to preach among the people, and
  to declare unto them that there should be no Christ. And he preached
  many things which were flattering unto the people; and this he did
  that he might overthrow the doctrine of Christ.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And he labored diligently that he might lead away the hearts of the
  people, insomuch that he did lead away many hearts.
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  And he knowing that I, Jacob, had faith in Christ who should come, he
  sought much opportunity that he might come unto me.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And he was learned, that he had a perfect
  knowledge of the language of the people; wherefore, he could use much
  flattery and much power of speech, according to the power of the
  devil.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And he had hope to shake me from the
  faith, notwithstanding the many revelations and the many things which
  I had seen concerning these things; for I truly had seen angels and
  they had ministered unto me. And also, I had heard the voice of the
  Lord speaking unto me in very word from time to time; wherefore, I
  could not be shaken.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And it came to pass that he came unto me, and on this wise did he
  speak unto me, saying:
  </span><quote><span>Brother Jacob, I have sought much opportunity
  that I might speak unto you; for I have heard and also know that
  thou goest about much, preaching that which ye call the gospel or
  the doctrine of Christ.
   </span><verse>7</verse><span>And ye have led away much of this people that they pervert the
   right way of God and keep not the law of Moses which is the right
   way; and convert the law of Moses into the worship of a being which
   ye say shall come many hundred years hence. And now behold, I,
   Sherem, declare unto you that this is blasphemy; for no man knoweth
   of such things; for he cannot tell of things to come. And after this
   manner did Sherem contend against me.</span></quote>

   What am I that I should tempt God to show unto thee a sign in the

   in heaven and in earth; and also, that Christ shall come. And thy
   will, O Lord, be done, and not mine.

  <verse>24</verse><span>And it came to pass that many means were devised to reclaim and
  restore the Lamanites to the knowledge of the truth; but it all was
  vain, for they delighted in wars and bloodshed, and they had an
  eternal hatred against us, their brethren. And they sought by the
  power of their arms to destroy us continually.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>Wherefore, the people of Nephi did fortify against them with their

  best of my knowledge, by saying that the time passed away with us,
  and also our lives passed away like as it were unto us a dream, we
  being a lonesome and a solemn people, wanderers, cast out from
  Jerusalem, born in tribulation, in a wilderness, and hated of our
  brethren, which caused wars and contentions; wherefore, we did mourn
  out our days.

  obedience unto the commands. And I make an end of my writing upon
  these plates, which writing has been small; and to the reader I bid
  farewell, hoping that many of my brethren may read my words.
  Brethren, adieu.
