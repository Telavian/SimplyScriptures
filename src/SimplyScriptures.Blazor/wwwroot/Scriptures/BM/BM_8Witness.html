  Be it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, unto whom
  this work shall come: That Joseph Smith, Jun., the translator of this
  work, has shown unto us the plates of which hath been spoken, which have
  the appearance of gold; and as many of the leaves as the said Smith has
  translated we did handle with our hands; and we also saw the engravings
  thereon, all of which has the appearance of ancient work, and of curious
  workmanship. And this we bear record with words of soberness, that the
  said Smith has shown unto us, for we have seen and hefted, and know of a
  surety that the said Smith has got the plates of which we have spoken. And
  we give our names unto the world, to witness unto the world that which we
  have seen. And we lie not, God bearing witness of it.
