 <chapter>1</chapter>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Behold, it came to pass that I, Enos, knowing my father that he was
  a just man—for he taught me in his language, and also in the nurture
  and admonition of the Lord—and blessed be the name of my God for
  it—</span><verse>2</verse><span>and I will tell you of the wrestle which I had before God, before I
  received a remission of my sins.

  Enos prays for his own soul

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>Behold, I went to hunt beasts in the forests; and the words which I
  had often heard my father speak concerning eternal life, and the joy
  of the saints, sunk deep into my heart.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And my soul hungered; and I kneeled down before my Maker, and I
  cried unto him in mighty prayer and supplication for mine own soul;
  and all the day long did I cry unto him; yea, and when the night
  came I did still raise my voice high that it reached the heavens.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And there came a voice unto me, saying:</span><quote><span>
   Enos, thy sins are forgiven thee, and thou shalt be blessed.
  </span></quote>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And I, Enos, knew that God could not lie; wherefore, my guilt was
  swept away.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And I said, “Lord, how is it done?”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>And he said unto me:</span><quote><span>
   Because of thy faith in Christ, whom thou hast never before heard nor
   seen. And many years pass away before he shall manifest himself in the
   flesh; wherefore, go to, thy faith hath made thee whole.

  Enos prays for the welfare of his brethren
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>Now, it came to pass that when I had heard these words I began to
  feel a desire for the welfare of my brethren, the Nephites;
  wherefore, I did pour out my whole soul unto God for them.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>And while I was thus struggling in the Spirit, behold, the voice of
  the Lord came into my mind again, saying:</span><quote><span>
   I will visit thy brethren according to their diligence in keeping my
   commandments. I have given unto them this land, and it is a holy land;
   and I curse it not save it be for the cause of iniquity; wherefore, I
   will visit thy brethren according as I have said; and their
   transgressions will I bring down with sorrow upon their own heads.
  </span></quote>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>And after I, Enos, had heard these words, my faith began to be
  unshaken in the Lord; and I prayed unto him with many long
  strugglings for my brethren, the Lamanites.

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>And it came to pass that after I had prayed and labored with all
  diligence, the Lord said unto me:</span><quote><span>
   I will grant unto thee according to thy desires, because of thy faith.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>And now behold, this was the desire which I desired of him—that if
  it should so be, that my people, the Nephites, should fall into
  transgression, and by any means be destroyed, and the Lamanites
  should not be destroyed, that the Lord God would preserve a record
  of my people, the Nephites; even if it so be by the power of his
  holy arm, that it might be brought forth at some future day unto the
  Lamanites, that, perhaps, they might be brought unto
  salvation.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>For at the present our strugglings were vain in restoring them to
  the true faith. And they swore in their wrath that, if it were
  possible, they would destroy our records and us, and also all the
  traditions of our fathers.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>Wherefore, I knowing that the Lord God was able to preserve our
  records, I cried unto him continually, for he had said unto
  me:</span><quote><span>
   Whatsoever thing ye shall ask in faith, believing that ye shall
   receive in the name of Christ, ye shall receive it.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>And I had faith, and I did cry unto God that he would preserve the
  records. And he covenanted with me that he would bring them forth
  unto the Lamanites in his own due time.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And I, Enos, knew it would be according to the covenant which he
  had made; wherefore my soul did rest.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>And the Lord said unto me:</span><quote><span>
   Thy fathers have also required of me this thing; and it shall be done
   unto them according to their faith; for their faith was like unto
   thine.

  Enos preaches
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>And now it came to pass that I, Enos, went about among the people
  of Nephi, prophesying of things to come, and testifying of the
  things which I had heard and seen.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And I bear record that the people of Nephi did seek diligently to
  restore the Lamanites unto the true faith in God. But our labors
  were vain.
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  Their hatred was fixed, and they were led by their evil nature that
  they became wild, and ferocious, and a blood-thirsty people, full of
  idolatry and filthiness; feeding upon beasts of prey; dwelling in
  tents, and wandering about in the wilderness with a short skin girdle
  about their loins and their heads shaven; and their skill was in the
  bow, and in the cimeter, and the ax. And many of them did eat nothing
  save it was raw meat; and they were continually seeking to destroy us.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>And it came to pass that the people of Nephi did till the land, and
  raise all manner of grain, and of fruit, and flocks of herds, and
  flocks of all manner of cattle of every kind, and goats, and wild
  goats, and also many horses.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>And there were exceedingly many prophets among us. And the people
  were a stiffnecked people, hard to understand.
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>And there was nothing save it was exceeding harshness, preaching
  and prophesying of wars, and contentions, and destructions, and
  continually reminding them of death, and the duration of eternity,
  and the judgments and the power of God, and all these
  things—stirring them up continually to keep them in the fear of the
  Lord. I say there was nothing short of these things, and exceedingly
  great plainness of speech, would keep them from going down speedily
  to destruction. And after this manner do I write concerning them.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>And I saw wars between the Nephites and Lamanites in the course of
  my days.

  <verse>25</verse><span>And it came to pass that I began to be old, and an hundred and
  seventy and nine years had passed away from the time that our father
  Lehi left Jerusalem.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>And I saw that I must soon go down to my grave, having been wrought
  upon by the power of God that I must preach and prophesy unto this
  people, and declare the word according to the truth which is in
  Christ. And I have declared it in all my days, and have rejoiced in
  it above that of the world.

 <block>
  <verse>27</verse><span>And I soon go to the place of my rest, which is with my Redeemer;
  for I know that in him I shall rest. And I rejoice in the day when
  my mortal shall put on immortality, and shall stand before him; then
  shall I see his face with pleasure, and he will say unto me, “Come
  unto me, ye blessed, there is a place prepared for you in the
  mansions of my Father.” Amen.
