 <chapter>1</chapter>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Behold, it came to pass that I, Omni, being commanded by my father,
  Jarom, that I should write somewhat upon these plates, to preserve
  our genealogy.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>Wherefore, in my days, I would that ye should know that I fought
  much with the sword to preserve my people, the Nephites, from
  falling into the hands of their enemies, the Lamanites. But behold,
  I of myself am a wicked man, and I have not kept the statutes and
  the commandments of the Lord as I ought to have done.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And it came to pass that two hundred and seventy and six years had
  passed away, and we had many seasons of peace; and we had many
  seasons of serious war and bloodshed. Yea, and in fine, two hundred
  and eighty and two years had passed away, and I had kept these
  plates according to the commandments of my fathers; and I conferred
  them upon my son Amaron.
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  And I make an end.
 </span></block>

 <blockheading><span>
  AMARON
 </span></blockheading>
 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>And now I, Amaron, write the things whatsoever I write, which are
  few, in the book of my father.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>Behold, it came to pass that three hundred and twenty years had
  passed away, and the more wicked part of the Nephites were
  destroyed.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>For the Lord would not suffer, after he had led them out of the
  land of Jerusalem and kept and preserved them from falling into the
  hands of their enemies, yea, he would not suffer that the words
  should not be verified, which he spake unto our fathers, saying
  that, “Inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments ye shall not
  prosper in the land.”
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>Wherefore, the Lord did visit them in great judgment; nevertheless,
  he did spare the righteous that they should not perish, but did
  deliver them out of the hands of their enemies.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>And it came to pass that I did deliver the plates unto my brother
  Chemish.
 </span></block>

 <blockheading><span>
  CHEMISH
 </span></blockheading>
 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>Now I, Chemish, write what few things I write, in the same book
  with my brother. For behold, I saw the last which he wrote, that he
  wrote it with his own hand; and he wrote it in the day that he
  delivered them unto me. And after this manner we keep the records,
  for it is according to the commandments of our fathers. And I make
  an end.
 </span></block>

 <blockheading><span>
  ABINADOM
 </span></blockheading>
 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>Behold, I, Abinadom, am the son of Chemish.
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  Behold, it came to pass that I saw much war and contention between my
  people, the Nephites, and the Lamanites; and I, with my own sword,
  have taken the lives of many of the Lamanites in the defence of my
  brethren.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And behold, the record of this
  people is engraven upon plates which is had by the kings, according to
  the generations; and I know of no revelation save that which has been
  written, neither prophecy; wherefore, that which is sufficient is
  written. And I make an end.

  AMALEKI

  <verse>12</verse><span>Behold, I am Amaleki, the son of Abinadom.

  Mosiah flees to Zarahemla
 </span></heading>

 <block><span>
  Behold, I will speak unto you somewhat concerning Mosiah, who was made
  king over the land of Zarahemla; for behold, he being warned of the
  Lord that he should flee out of the land of Nephi, and as many as
  would hearken unto the voice of the Lord should also depart out of the
  land with him, into the wilderness—</span><verse>13</verse><span>and it
  came to pass that he did according as the Lord had commanded him. And
  they departed out of the land into the wilderness, as many as would
  hearken unto the voice of the Lord; and they were led by many
  preachings and prophesyings. And they were admonished continually by
  the word of God; and they were led by the power of his arm, through
  the wilderness until they came down into the land which is called the
  land of Zarahemla.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And they discovered a
  people, who were called the people of Zarahemla.
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  Now, there was great rejoicing among the people of Zarahemla; and also
  Zarahemla did rejoice exceedingly, because the Lord had sent the
  people of Mosiah with the plates of brass which contained the record
  of the Jews.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  The people of Zarahemla
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>Behold, it came to pass that Mosiah discovered that the people of
  Zarahemla came out from Jerusalem at the time that Zedekiah, king of
  Judah, was carried away captive into Babylon.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And they journeyed in the wilderness, and were brought by the hand
  of the Lord across the great waters, into the land where Mosiah
  discovered them; and they had dwelt there from that time
  forth.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>And at the time that Mosiah discovered them, they had become
  exceedingly numerous. Nevertheless, they had had many wars and
  serious contentions, and had fallen by the sword from time to time;
  and their language had become corrupted; and they had brought no
  records with them; and they denied the being of their Creator.
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  And Mosiah, nor the people of Mosiah, could understand them.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>But it came to pass that Mosiah caused that
  they should be taught in his language. And it came to pass that after
  they were taught in the language of Mosiah, Zarahemla gave a genealogy
  of his fathers, according to his memory; and they are written, but not
  in these plates.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And it came to pass that
  the people of Zarahemla, and of Mosiah, did unite together; and Mosiah
  was appointed to be their king.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>And it came to pass in the days of Mosiah, there was a large stone
  brought unto him with engravings on it; and he did interpret the
  engravings by the gift and power of God.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>And they gave an account of one Coriantumr, and the slain of his
  people. And Coriantumr was discovered by the people of Zarahemla;
  and he dwelt with them for the space of nine moons.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>It also spake a few words concerning his fathers. And his first
  parents came out from the tower, at the time the Lord confounded the
  language of the people; and the severity of the Lord fell upon them
  according to his judgments, which are just; and their bones lay
  scattered in the land northward.

  King Benjamin
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>Behold, I, Amaleki, was born in the days of Mosiah; and I have
  lived to see his death; and Benjamin, his son, reigneth in his
  stead.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>And behold, I have seen, in the days of king Benjamin, a serious
  war and much bloodshed between the Nephites and the Lamanites.
  But behold, the Nephites did obtain much advantage over them; yea,
  insomuch that king Benjamin did drive them out of the land of
  Zarahemla.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>25</verse><span>And it came to pass that I began to be old; and, having no seed,
  and knowing king Benjamin to be a just man before the Lord,
  wherefore, I shall deliver up these plates unto him, exhorting all
  men to come unto God, the Holy One of Israel, and believe in
  prophesying, and in revelations, and in the ministering of angels,
  and in the gift of speaking with tongues, and in the gift of
  interpreting languages, and in all things which are good; for there
  is nothing which is good save it comes from the Lord; and that which
  is evil cometh from the devil.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>And now, my beloved brethren, I would that ye should come unto
  Christ, who is the Holy One of Israel, and partake of his salvation,
  and the power of his redemption. Yea, come unto him, and offer your
  whole souls as an offering unto him, and continue in fasting and
  praying, and endure to the end; and as the Lord liveth ye will be
  saved.

 <block>
  <verse>27</verse><span>And now I would speak somewhat concerning a certain number who went
  up into the wilderness to return to the land of Nephi; for there was
  a large number who were desirous to possess the land of their
  inheritance.
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>Wherefore, they went up into the wilderness.
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  And their leader being a strong and mighty man, and a stiffnecked man,
  wherefore he caused a contention among them; and they were all slain,
  save fifty, in the wilderness, and they returned again to the land of
  Zarahemla.
  </span><verse>29</verse><span>And it came to pass that they
  also took others to a considerable number, and took their journey
  again into the wilderness.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>30</verse><span>And I, Amaleki, had a brother, who also went with them; and I have
  not since known concerning them. And I am about to lie down in my
  grave; and these plates are full. And I make an end of my
  speaking.
