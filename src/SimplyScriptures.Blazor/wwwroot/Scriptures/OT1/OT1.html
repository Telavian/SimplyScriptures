 <book><span>ABOUT THIS EDITION</span></book>
 <journalaccount>
  <block><span>
   This edition of THE OLD TESTAMENT increases readability by modernizing
   the page layout. The text is formatted into standard paragraphs and white
   space and other modern tools (section headers, bullet lists, etc.) are
   used to help with readability. Chapter and verse references are visually
   subdued so as to not distract from the message.
  </span></block>

  <block><span>
   Words that are part of the actual scriptural record appear in
   serif font. Anything not part of that record
   (verse numbers, section numbers, and section headers) appears in this
   sans-serif font. Anything in a sans-serif font is an addition of men and
   can be treated accordingly.
  </span></block>

  <block><span>
   This edition uses the text from the Inspired Version, or Joseph Smith
   Translation (JST), of the Bible, while using King James Version verse
   numbers for convenience. Significant changes in wording between the KJV
   text and the JST text are indicated by an
   </span><under><span>underline</span></under><span>, and the KJV text appears in the margin.
   Significant additions not found in the KJV text are indicated by a
   </span><dunder><span>dashed underline</span></dunder><span>.
  </span></block>

  <block><span>
   Many text differences between the JST and the KJV have little to no impact
   on the meaning, such as:
  </span></block>

  <block style="display:grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr">

    <under><span>And</span></under><span>
    blessed are
    </span><under><span>all</span></under><span>
    they
    </span><under><span>that</span></under><span>

    thirst after righteousness

  <block><span>
   Because the goal of this version is to increase readability, simple
   differences such as these are not indicated. When a change is indicated,
   there is a significant difference that should be given attention.

  <block><span>
   In the Hebrew text, the name of God is יהוה ,often transliterated as YHVH or YHWH. In the KJV, that name is represented as LORD or GOD, in all capitals. The JST did not use this method, so textual additions
   do not have these names in all capitals even though surrounding usage would indicate they were
   appropriate. There are two significant variations that are used frequently in the Old Testament:

   This version has minimally updated the archaic English of the original. The -eth verb ending (causeth, doeth,
   etc.) has been updated to modern verb endings (causes, does, etc.). Archaic personal pronouns before a
   vowel sound (mine arm) have also been updated (my arm). When there wasn’t a direct modern equivalent,
   the archaic word was retained. For example, thou lacks a modern equivalent. You is ambiguous and can
   mean one or many – whereas thou is one person only. Thou and its archaic verb endings have been retained.

   And it came to pass, that the Lord spake unto Moses, saying:
  </span></dunder>
  <quote>
   <dunder><span>Behold, I reveal unto you concerning this heaven and this earth; write
   the words which I speak. I am the Beginning and the End; the Almighty God. By mine Only
   Begotten I created these things.</span></dunder>
   <verse>1</verse><span>Yea, in
   the beginning I created the heaven, and the earth
   </span><dunder><span>upon which thou standest</span></dunder><span>.
   </span><verse>2</verse><span>And the earth was
   without form, and void; and
   </span><dunder><span>I caused</span></dunder><span>
   darkness to come up upon the
   face of the deep. And my Spirit moved upon the face of the waters, for I
   am God.

  Day 1: Light
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>And I, God, said, “Let there be light,” and
  there was light.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And I, God, saw the light, and
  that light was good. And I, God, divided the light from the darkness.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And I, God, called the light day, and the
  darkness I called night.
  </span><dunder><span>And this I did by the word of my power; and it was done as I spake</span></dunder><span>. And the evening and the morning
  were the first day.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  Day 2: Waters
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And again, I, God, said, “Let there be a
  firmament in the midst of the waters;” and
  </span><dunder><span>it was so, even as I spake. And I said,</span></dunder><span>
  “Let it divide the waters from the
  waters;”
  </span><dunder><span>and it was done</span></dunder><span>.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And I, God,
  made the firmament, and divided the waters; yea, the great waters under
  the firmament, from the waters which were above the firmament; and it was
  so,
  </span><dunder><span>even as I spake</span></dunder><span>.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>And I,
  God, called the firmament heaven. And the evening and the morning were the
  second day.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  Day 3: Land and plants
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>And I, God, said, “Let the waters under the
  heaven be gathered together unto one place;” and
  </span><dunder><span>it was so. And I, God, said</span></dunder><span>, “Let there be dry land; and it was so.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And I, God, called the dry land earth; and the
  gathering together of the waters called I the sea. And I, God, saw that
  all things which I had made were good.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>And I, God, said, “Let the earth bring forth
  grass; the herb yielding seed; the fruit tree yielding fruit after his
  kind; and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed should be in itself, upon
  the earth;” and it was so,
  </span><dunder><span>even as I spake</span></dunder><span>.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And the earth brought forth grass; every herb
  yielding seed after his kind; and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed
  should be in itself, after his kind. And I, God, saw that all things which
  I had made were good.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And the evening and the
  morning were the third day.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  Day 4: Lights
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>And I, God, said, “Let there be lights in the
  firmament of the heaven, to divide the day from the night; and let them be
  for signs and for seasons, and for days and for years,
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>and let them be for lights in the firmament of
  the heaven, to give light upon the earth;” and it was so.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And I, God, made two great lights; the greater
  light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night;
  </span><dunder><span>and the greater light was the sun, and the lesser light was the moon</span></dunder><span>. And the stars also were made,
  </span><dunder><span>even according to my word</span></dunder><span>.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And I, God, set them in the firmament of the
  heaven, to give light upon the earth;
  </span><verse>18</verse><dunder><span>and the sun</span></dunder><span>
  to rule over the day, and
  </span><dunder><span>the moon to rule</span></dunder><span>
  over
  the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. And I, God, saw that all things which I had made were good.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And the evening and the morning were the fourth
  day.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  Day 5: Creatures of water and air
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>And I, God, said, “Let the waters bring forth abundantly, the moving
  creature that hath life, and fowl which may fly above the earth, in the
  open firmament of heaven.”
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>And I, God, created great whales, and every living creature that
  moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind; and
  every winged fowl, after his kind. And I, God, saw that all things which
  I had created were good;
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>and I, God, blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill
  the waters in the sea, and let fowl multiply in the earth.”
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  Day 6: Beasts of earth, man
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>And I, God, said, “Let the earth bring forth the living creature, after
  his kind; cattle and creeping things, and beasts of the earth, after
  their kind,” and it was so.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>And I, God, made the beasts of the earth, after their kind; and cattle
  after their kind; and everything which creepeth upon the earth, after
  his kind. And I, God, saw that all these things were good.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>26</verse><span>And I, God, said
  </span><dunder><span>unto mine Only Begotten, which was with me from the beginning</span></dunder><span>:
  </span><quote><span>Let
  us make man in our image, after our likeness.</span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And
  </span><dunder><span>it was so. And I, God, said</span></dunder><span>:
  </span><quote><span>
   Let them have dominion over the fishes of the sea, and over the fowl of
   the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every
   creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>27</verse><span>And I, God, created man in mine own image, in
  the image of
  </span><under><note><span>God</span></note><span>mine Only Begotten</span></under><span>
  created I him; male and female
  created I them.
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>And I, God, blessed them and
  said unto them:
  </span><quote><span>
   Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and
   have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and
   over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>29</verse><span>And I, God, said unto man:</span><quote><span>
   Behold, I have given you every herb, bearing seed, which is upon the face
   of all the earth; and every tree in the which shall be the fruit of a
   tree, yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
   </span><verse>30</verse><span>And to every beast of the earth, and to every
   fowl of the air, and to everything that creepeth upon the earth, wherein I
   grant life, there shall be given every clean herb for meat.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And it was so,
  </span><dunder><span>even as I spake</span></dunder><span>.
  </span><verse>31</verse><span>And I,
  God, saw everything that I had made, and behold, all things which I had
  made were very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.

  Day 7: Rest
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>2
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Thus the heaven and the earth were finished, and
  all the host of them.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And on the seventh day, I,
  God, ended my work, and all things which I had made; and I rested on the
  seventh day from all my work; and all things which I had made were
  finished.
  </span><dunder><span>And I, God, saw that they were good</span></dunder><span>.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And I, God, blessed the seventh day, and
  sanctified it, because that in it I had rested from all my work, which I,
  God, had created and made.

  THE GARDEN OF EDEN
 </span></blockheading>
 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>And now, behold, I say unto you, that these are
  the generations of the heaven, and of the earth, when they were created in
  the day that I the LORD God made the heaven and the earth,
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>and every plant of the field before it was in
  the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew;
  </span><dunder><span>for I, the Lord God, created all things of which I have spoken
  spiritually, before they were naturally upon the face of the earth</span></dunder><span>; for I, the
  LORD God, had not caused it to rain upon the face of the earth.

  The first flesh
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <dunder><span>And I, the Lord God, had created all the children of men</span></dunder><span>, and not
  yet a man to till the ground,
  </span><dunder><span>for in heaven created I them, and there was not yet flesh upon the
  earth, neither in the water, neither in the air</span></dunder><span>;
  </span><dunder><span>but I, the Lord God, spake</span></dunder><span>,
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>and there
  went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>And I, the LORD God, formed man from the dust of
  the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man
  became a living soul;
  </span><dunder><span>the first flesh upon the earth, the first man also; nevertheless, all things were before created, but
  spiritually were they created and made, according to my word.</span></dunder>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>And I, the LORD God, planted a garden eastward
  in Eden; and there I put the man whom I had formed.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>And out of the ground, made I, the LORD God, to
  grow every tree naturally, that is pleasant to the sight of man</span><dunder><span>, and man could behold it, and it became also</span></dunder><span>
  a
  </span><dunder><span>living soul; for it was spiritual in the day that I created it; for it
  remaineth in the sphere in which I, God, created it; yea, even all things which I prepared for
  the use of man; and man saw that</span></dunder><span>
  it was good for food.
  </span><dunder><span>And I, the Lord God, planted</span></dunder><span>
  the tree of life also, in the midst of
  the garden; and also the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>And I, the LORD God, caused a river to go out of Eden, to water the
  garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And I, the LORD God, called the name of the first Pison, and it
  compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where I, the LORD, created much
  gold;
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>and the gold of that land was good, and there was bdellium, and the
  onyx stone.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And the name of the second river was called Gihon, the same that
  compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And the name of the third river was Hiddekel, that which goeth toward
  the east of Assyria. And the fourth river was Euphrates.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And I, the LORD God, took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden,
  to dress it, and to keep it.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And I, the LORD God, commanded the man, saying:</span><quote><span>
   Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat;
   </span><verse>17</verse><span>but of the tree of the knowledge of good and
   evil, thou shalt not eat of it;
   </span><dunder><span>nevertheless, thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is given unto thee; but remember that I forbid i</span></dunder><span>t; for in
   the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.
  </span></quote>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>And I, the LORD God, said
  </span><dunder><span>unto mine Only Begotten</span></dunder><span>, that it was not good that the man should
  be alone;
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>wherefore, I will make an help meet
  for him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>And out of the ground, I the LORD God, formed
  every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and commanded that
  they should come unto Adam, to see what he would call them. And
  </span><dunder><span>they were also living souls; for I, God, breathed into them the breath
  of life, and commanded tha</span></dunder><span>t whatsoever Adam called every living
  creature, that should be the name thereof.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And
  Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every
  beast of the field; but as for Adam, there was not found an help meet for
  him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>And I, the LORD God, caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he
  slept, and I took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in the stead
  thereof;
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>and the rib, which I, the LORD God had taken from man, made I a woman,
  and brought her unto the man.
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>And Adam said:</span><quote><span>
   This I know now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. She shall be
   called woman, because she was taken out of man.
   </span><verse>24</verse><span>Therefore shall a man leave his father and his

  Satan’s backstory

 <chapter>3

 <block>
  <dunder><span>
   And I, the Lord God, spake unto Moses, saying:
   </span><quote><span>
    That Satan whom thou hast commanded in the name of mine Only Begotten, is
    the same which was from the beginning; and he came
    before me, saying, “Behold I, send me, I will be
    thy Son, and I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be
    lost, and surely I will do it; wherefore, give me
    thine honor.”
   </span></quote>
   <quote><span>
    But behold, my beloved Son, which was my beloved and chosen from the
    beginning, said unto me, “Father, thy will be done,
    and the glory be thine forever.”
   </span></quote>
   <quote><span>
    Wherefore, because that Satan rebelled against me, and sought to destroy
    the agency of man, which I, the Lord God, had given
    him; and also that I should give unto him mine own
    power; by the power of mine Only Begotten I caused that he should be cast down; and he became Satan. Yea, even the devil, the father of all
    lies, to deceive, and to blind men, and to lead
    them captive at his will, even as many as would not hearken unto my voice.

  <verse>1</verse><span>And now, the serpent was more subtle than any
  beast of the field, which I, the LORD God, had made.
  </span><dunder><span>And Satan put it into the heart of the serpent, for he had drawn
  away many after him; and he sought also to beguile Eve, for he knew not the
  mind of God</span></dunder><span>;
  </span><dunder><span>wherefore, he sought to destroy the world</span></dunder><span>.

 <block><span>And he said unto the woman:</span><quote><span>

  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And the woman said unto the serpent:

  <verse>6</verse><span>And when the woman saw that the tree was good

  gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And the eyes of them both were opened, and they
  knew that they had been naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and

   that great secret which was administered unto Cain
   by Satan; and Irad, the son of Enoch, having known their secret, began
   to reveal it unto the sons of Adam; wherefore,
   Lamech, being angry, slew him, not like unto Cain

    forsworn themselves, and by their oaths they have brought upon
    themselves death. And an hell I have prepared for
    them, if they repent not. And this is a decree which I have sent forth in the beginning of the world, from mine own
    mouth, from the foundation thereof; and by the
    mouths of my servants, thy fathers, have I decreed it; even as it shall be sent forth in the world, unto the end

   “Tarry ye here and keep the tents while we go yonder to behold the seer, for he prophesieth; and there is a strange

   not stand in his presence. And he said unto them:
   </span><quote>
    <block><span>Because that Adam fell, we are; and by his fall came death, and we are
    made partakers of misery and woe. Behold, Satan
    hath come among the children of men, and tempteth
    them to worship him; and men have become carnal, sensual, and
    devilish, and are shut out from the presence of
    God. But God hath made known unto our fathers, that
    all men must repent.</span></block>

    <block><span>And he called upon our father Adam, by his own voice, saying:
     </span><quote><span>“I am God; I made the world, and men before they were in the flesh.”</span></quote>
    </block>

    <block><span>
     And he also said unto him:
     </span><quote><span>If thou wilt, turn unto me and hearken unto my voice, and believe, and
     repent of all thy transgressions, and be baptized,
     even in water, in the name of mine Only Begotten
     Son, who is full of grace and truth, which is Jesus Christ, the only
     name which shall be given under heaven, whereby
     salvation shall come unto the children of men; and
     ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, asking all things in his name, and whatsoever ye shall ask it shall be given you.”</span></quote>
    </block>

    <block><span>And our father Adam spake unto the Lord, and said, “Why is it that men
    must repent, and be baptized in water?”</span></block>

    <block><span>And the Lord said unto Adam, “Behold, I have forgiven thee thy
    transgression in the garden of Eden.”</span></block>

    <block><span>Hence came the saying abroad among the people, that the Son of God hath
    atoned for original guilt, wherein the sins of the
    parents cannot be answered upon the heads of the
    children, for they are whole from the foundation of the world.</span></block>

    <block><span>And the Lord spake unto Adam, saying:
     </span><quote>
      <block><span>Inasmuch as thy children are conceived in sin, even so, when they begin to
      grow up sin conceiveth in their hearts, and they
      taste the bitter, that they may know to prize the
      good. And it is given unto them to know good from evil; wherefore, they are agents unto themselves.</span></block>

      <block><span>And I have given unto you another law and commandment; wherefore teach
      it unto your children, that all men, everywhere,
      must repent, or they can in no wise inherit the
      kingdom of God. For no unclean thing can dwell there, or dwell in his presence; for, in the language of Adam, Man of Holiness is his name; and
      the name of his Only Begotten is the son of Man,
      even Jesus Christ, a righteous judge, who shall
      come in the meridian of time. Therefore I give unto you a commandment, to teach these things freely unto
      your children, saying, that by reason of
      transgression cometh the fall, which fall bringeth death; and inasmuch as ye were born into the world by water and blood, and the spirit, which
      I have made, and so become of dust a living soul;
      even so ye must be born again, into the kingdom of
      heaven, of water, and of the Spirit, and be cleansed by blood, even the blood of mine Only Begotten; that ye may be sanctified from all sin;
      and enjoy the words of eternal life in this world,
      and eternal life in the world to come; even
      immortal glory.
      </span></block>

      <block><span>For, by the water ye keep the commandment; by the Spirit ye are justified;
      and by the blood ye are sanctified. Therefore it is
      given to abide in you, the record of heaven, the
      Comforter, the peaceable things of immortal glory, the truth of all things, that which quickeneth all things which maketh alive all things, that which
      knoweth all things, and hath all power according to wisdom, mercy, truth,
      justice and judgment.</span></block>

      <block><span>And now, behold, I say unto you, this is the plan of salvation unto all
      men, through the blood of mine Only Begotten, who
      shall come in the meridian of time. And, behold,
      all things have their likeness; and all things are created and made to bear record of me; both things which are temporal, and things
      which are spiritual; things which are in the
      heavens above, and things which are on the earth,
      and things which are in the earth, and things which are under the
      earth, both above and beneath, all things bear
      record of me.</span></block>

   <block><span>As I was journeying, and stood in the place Mahujah, and cried unto the
   Lord, there came a voice out of heaven, saying,
   “Turn ye and get ye upon the mount Simeon.” And it
   came to pass, that I turned and went up on the mount; and as I stood upon
   the mount, I beheld the heavens open, and I was
   clothed upon with glory. And I saw the Lord, and he
   stood before my face, and he talked with me, even as a man talketh one with another, face to face; and he said unto
   me, “Look, and I will show unto thee the world for
   the space of many generations.” And it came to pass, that I beheld in
   the valley of Shum, and, lo! A great people which
   dwelt in tents, which were the people of Shum. And
   again the Lord said unto me, “Look;” and I looked towards the north, and I beheld the people of Cainan, which dwelt in tents.</span></block>

   <block><span>And the Lord said unto me, “Prophesy;” and I prophesied saying:
    </span><quote><span>Behold, the people of Cainan which are numerous, shall go forth in battle

    them, that they shall be utterly destroyed. And the
    people of Cainan shall divide themselves in the land, and the land shall be barren and unfruitful, and none other people shall dwell

   unto me, “Go forth to this people, and say unto
   them, ‘Repent;’ lest I come out and smite them with a curse, and they
   die.”</span></block>

   <block><span>And he gave unto me a commandment, that I should baptize in the name of

   so great was the faith of Enoch, that he led the people of God, and their enemies came to battle against them, and he spake the word
   of the Lord, and the earth trembled, and the
   mountains fled, even according to his command. And the rivers of water were turned out of their course, and the roar of the

   There also came up a land out of the depths of the sea; and so great was

   also stood afar off; and there went forth a curse
   upon all the people which fought against God. And from that time forth, there were wars, and bloodshed among them; but the Lord came

    their sins shall be upon the heads of their fathers; Satan shall be their father, and misery shall be their doom; and the

    workmanship of my hands. Wherefore should not the
    heavens weep, seeing these shall suffer? But, behold, these which thine eyes are upon shall
    perish in the floods; and, behold, I will shut them up; a prison have I prepared for them, and he whom I have chosen
    hath pleaded before my face; wherefore he suffereth
    for their sins, inasmuch as they will repent, in the day that my chosen shall return unto me; and until that day they shall be in torment.

    And great tribulations shall be among the children of men, but my people will I preserve; and righteousness will I send down
    out of heaven, and truth will I send forth out of
    the earth, to bear testimony of mine Only Begotten; his resurrection from the dead; yea, and also the resurrection of all
    men. And righteousness and truth will I cause to
    sweep the earth as with a flood, to gather out mine
    own elect from the four quarters of the earth, unto a place which I shall
    prepare; an holy city, that my people may gird up
    their loins, and be looking forth for the time of
    my coming; for there shall be my tabernacle, and it shall be called Zion;

   And now, Melchizedek was a priest of this
   order; therefore he obtained peace in Salem, and
   was called the Prince of peace.
   And his people wrought righteousness, and
   obtained heaven, and sought for the city of Enoch
   which God had before taken, separating it from the
   earth, having reserved it unto the latter days, or the end of the
   world;
   and hath said, and sworn with
   an oath, that the heavens and the earth should come together; and the
   sons of God should be tried so as by fire.</span></dunder>
 </block>

 <block>
  <dunder><span>
   And this Melchizedek, having thus established
   righteousness, was called the king of heaven by his
   people, or, in other words, the King of peace.
   And he lifted up his voice, and he blessed Abram, being the high priest, and the keeper of the
   storehouse of God;
   him whom God had appointed to receive tithes for the poor.
   Wherefore, Abram paid unto him tithes of all that he had, of all the riches which he possessed,
   which God had given him more than that which he had
   need.</span></dunder>
 </block>

 <block>
  <dunder><span>
   And it came to pass, that God blessed Abram, and gave unto him riches,
   and honor, and lands for an everlasting possession;
   according to the covenant which he had made, and according to the blessing wherewith Melchizedek had blessed him.

  <verse>1</verse><span>And it came to pass, that there came
  </span><under>
   <note><span>two</span></note><span>three</span></under><span>
  angels to Sodom in the evening; and Lot sat in
  </span><under>
   <note><span>the gate of Sodom</span></note><span>the door of his house, in the city of Sodom</span></under><span>. And Lot, seeing the
   angels, rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward
   the ground;
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>and he said:
  </span><quote><span>
   Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant’s house, and
   tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on
   your ways.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And they said, “Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.”
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And he pressed upon them greatly; and they
  turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast,
  and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>But before they lay down to rest, the men of the
  city of Sodom compassed the house round, even men which were both old and
  young, even the people from every quarter;
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>and
  they called unto Lot, and said unto him, “Where are the men which came in
  unto thee this night? Bring them out unto us, that we may know them.”
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And Lot went out of the door, unto them, and
  shut the door after him,
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>and said, “I pray you,
  brethren, do not so wickedly.”
  </span><verse>(9)</verse><span>And they said
  unto him, “Stand back.” And they were angry with him.
  </span><dunder><span>And they said among themselves, “This one man came in to sojourn among
  us, and he will needs now make himself to be a judge; now we will deal worse with
  him than with</span></dunder>
  <dunder><span>them.” Wherefore they said unto the man, “We will have the men, and thy
  daughters</span></dunder> <dunder><span>also; and we will do with them as seemeth us good.” Now this was after
  the wickedness of Sodom</span></dunder><span>.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>(8)</verse><span>And Lot said:</span><quote><span>
   Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray
   you, </span><dunder><span>plead with my brethren that I may no</span></dunder><span>t bring them out unto you;
   and
   </span><dunder><span>ye shall not</span></dunder><span>
   do unto them as seemeth good in your eyes;
   </span><dunder><span>for God will not justify his servant in this thing; wherefore, let me plead with my brethren, this once only,
   that</span></dunder><span>
   unto these men ye do nothing,
   </span><dunder><span>that they may have peace in my house</span></dunder><span>;
   for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And they
  </span><dunder><span>were angry with Lot and</span></dunder><span>
  came near to break the door, but
  the angels of God, which were holy men, put forth their hand and pulled
  Lot into the house unto them, and shut the door.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>And they smote the men with blindness, both
  small and great, that they could not come at the door.
  </span><dunder><span>And they were angry, so that they wearied themselves to find the door,
  and could not find it.</span></dunder>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>And these
  </span><dunder><span>holy</span></dunder><span>
  men said unto Lot:
  </span><quote><span>
   Hast thou any here besides thy sons-in-law, and thy son’s sons and thy
   daughters?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And they commanded Lot, saying:
  </span><quote><span>
   Whatsoever thou hast in the city, thou shalt bring out of this place,
   </span><verse>13</verse><span>for we will destroy this place; because the cry
   of them is waxen great, and their abominations have come up before the
   face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>And Lot went out and spake unto his sons-in-law, which married his
  daughters, and said, “Up, get ye out of this place, for the LORD will
  destroy this city.” But he seemed as one that mocked, unto his
  sons-in-law.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And when the morning came, the angels hastened Lot, saying:</span><quote><span>
   Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters which are here, lest thou be
   consumed in the iniquity of the city.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>And while he lingered the
  </span><under>
   <note><span>men</span></note><span>angels</span></under><span>
  laid
  hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of
  his two daughters; the LORD being merciful unto them; and they brought
  them forth, and set them down without the city.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And it came to pass, when they had brought them
  forth abroad that they said unto them:
  </span><quote><span>
   Escape for your lives; look not behind you, neither stay you in all the
   plain; escape to the mountain lest you be consumed.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>And Lot said unto one of them:</span><quote>
   <block><span>Oh, not so my Lord!
    </span><verse>19</verse><span>Behold now, thy servant has
    found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy which thou
    hast showed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the
    mountain, lest some evil overtake me, and I die.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>20</verse><span>Behold now, here is another city, and this is
    near to flee unto and it is a little one;
    </span><dunder><span>oh, let me escape thither, and may the Lord not destroy it</span></dunder><span>, and my soul
    shall live.</span></block>

  </quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>And the angel said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not
   overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken;
   </span><verse>22</verse><span>haste thee, escape thither, for I cannot do
   anything until thou be come thither.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And the name of the city was called Zoar.
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>Therefore the sun was risen upon the earth when
  Lot entered into Zoar.
  </span><dunder><span>And the Lord did not destroy Sodom until Lot had entered into Zoar</span></dunder><span>.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>And then, when Lot had entered into Zoar, the
  LORD rained upon Sodom, and upon Gomorrah;
  </span><dunder><span>for the angels called upon the name of the Lord for brimstone and fire
  from the Lord out of heaven</span></dunder><span>.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>And thus they
  overthrew those cities and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the
  cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>But it came to pass, when Lot fled, his wife
  looked back from behind him, and became a pillar of salt.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>27</verse><span>And Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he stood
  before the LORD;
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>and he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the
  plain, and behold, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of
  a furnace.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>29</verse><span>And it came to pass, when God had destroyed the cities of the plain,
  that God spake unto Abraham, saying:
  </span><quote><span>
   I have remembered Lot, and sent him out of the midst of the overthrow,
   that thy brother might not be destroyed, when I overthrew the city in the
   which thy brother Lot dwelt.
  </span></quote>

   And Abraham was comforted.</span></dunder>

 <heading><span>Lot’s daughters
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>30</verse><span>And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the
  mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar.
  And he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
  </span><verse>31</verse><span>And the firstborn
  </span><dunder><span>dealt wickedly, and</span></dunder><span>
  said unto the younger:
  </span><quote><span>
   Our father has become old, and we have not a man on the earth to come in
   unto us,
   </span><dunder><span>to live with us</span></dunder><span>
   after the manner of all that live on the
   earth;
   </span><verse>32</verse><span>Therefore come, let us make our father
   drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our
   father.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>33</verse><span>And they
  </span><dunder><span>did wickedly, and</span></dunder><span>
  made their
  father drink wine that night; and the firstborn went in and lay with her
  father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
  </span><verse>34</verse><span>And it came to pass on the morrow, that the
  firstborn said unto the younger:
  </span><quote><span>
   Behold, I lay yesternight with my father; let us make him drink wine this
   night also, and go thou in and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of
   our father.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>35</verse><span>And they made their father drink wine that night also; and the younger
  arose, and lay with him, and he perceived not when she lay down, nor
  when she arose.
  </span><verse>36</verse><span>Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.
  </span><verse>37</verse><span>And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab; the father of
  the Moabites, the same which are unto this day.
  </span><verse>38</verse><span>And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi; the
  father of the children which are Ammonites; the same which are unto this
  day.

  Abraham in Gerar
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>20
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelt
  between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And Abraham said again of Sarah his wife, “She is my sister.” And
  Abimelech, king of Gerar, sent and took Sarah.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   Behold, thou hast taken a woman which is not thine own, for she is
   Abraham’s wife.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And the LORD said unto him:
  </span><quote><span>
   Thou shalt return her unto Abraham, for if thou do it not thou shalt die.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>And Abimelech had not come near her; for the LORD had not suffered him.
  And he said:</span><quote><span>
   Lord, wilt thou slay me, and also a righteous nation?
   </span><verse>5</verse><span>Behold, said he not unto me, “She is my sister?”
   And she, even she herself said, “He is my brother;” and in the integrity
   of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And God said unto him in a dream:</span><quote><span>
   Yea, I know that thou didst do this in the integrity of thy heart; for I
   also withheld thee from sinning against me; therefore suffered I not thee
   to touch her.
   </span><verse>7</verse><span>Now, therefore, restore the man’s
   wife to him, for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou
   shalt live; and if thou restore her not to him, know thou that thou shalt
   surely die; thou and all that are thine.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>Therefore, Abimelech arose early in the morning, and called his
  servants, and told all these things in their ears; and the men were sore
  afraid.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him:</span><quote><span>What hast thou done unto us? And in what have I offended thee that thou
  hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? Thou hast done things
  unto me that ought not to be done.</span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>And Abimelech said unto Abraham, “What sawest thou, that thou hast done
  this thing?”
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And Abraham said:</span><quote>
   <block><span>Because I thought assuredly the fear of God was not in this place, and
   they would slay me for my wife’s sake;
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>and yet
    indeed she was my sister; she was the daughter of my father, but not the
    daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>13</verse><span>And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father’s
    house, that I said unto her, “This shall be thy kindness which thou
    shalt show unto me, at every place whither we shall come, say of me, ‘He
    is my brother.’”</span></block>

  </quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>And Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants,
  and gave unto Abraham, and restored unto him Sarah his wife.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>And Abimelech said, “Behold, my land lieth before thee; dwell where it
  pleaseth thee.”
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And unto Sarah he said:</span><quote><span>
   Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver; behold, he
   shall give unto thee a covering of the eyes,
   </span><dunder><span>and it shall be a token</span></dunder><span>
   unto all
   </span><dunder><span>that thou mayest not be taken again from Abraham thy husband</span></dunder><span>.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And thus she was reproved.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>So Abraham prayed
  unto God; and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants,
  and they bare unto him children.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>For because of
  Sarah, Abraham’s wife, the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the
  house of Abimelech.

  The birth of Isaac

 <chapter>21
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and
  the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken
  </span><dunder><span>by the mouth of his angels;</span></dunder>
  <verse>2</verse><span>for Sarah
  conceived and bear Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which
  the angels of God had spoken to him.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And Abraham
  called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bear unto
  him, Isaac.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And Abraham circumcised his son
  Isaac, he being eight days old, as God had commanded him.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto
  him.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And Sarah said, “God has made me to
  </span><under>
   <note><span>laugh</span></note><span>rejoice</span></under><span>; and also all that know me
   will
  </span><under>
   <note><span>laugh</span></note><span>rejoice</span></under><span>
  with me.”
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And she said unto
  Abraham, “Who would have said that Sarah should have given children suck?
  </span><dunder><span>For I was barren, but the Lord promised</span></dunder><span>, and I have borne unto
  Abraham a son in his old age.”
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  Hagar and Ishmael sent away
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>And the child grew, and was weaned. And the day
  that Isaac was weaned, Abraham made a great feast,
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>and Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian,
  which Hagar had borne unto Abraham, mocking; a</span><dunder><span>nd she was troubled</span></dunder><span>.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>Wherefore she said unto Abraham, “Cast out this
  bondwoman and her son; for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir
  with my son, Isaac.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>And this thing was very grievous unto Abraham because of his son.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And God said unto Abraham:</span><quote><span>
   Let it not be grievous in thy sight, because of the lad, and because of
   thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah has said unto thee, hearken unto her
   voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
   </span><verse>13</verse><span>And also of the son of the bondwoman will I
   make a nation, because he is thy seed.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle
  of water, and gave unto Hagar, and she took the child, and he sent her
  away; and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of
  Beersheba.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And it came to pass that the water was spent in the bottle, and she
  cast the child under one of the shrubs,
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>and she went and sat her down over against the child, a good way off,
  as it were a bowshot; for she said, “Let me not see the death of the
  child.” And she sat over against the child, and lifted up her voice and
  wept.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of the LORD called to
  Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her:</span><quote><span>
   What aileth thee, Hagar? Fear not, for God hath heard the voice of the lad
   where he lieth.
   </span><verse>18</verse><span>Arise, lift up the lad, and
   hold him in thine hand, for I will make of him a great nation.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went and
  filled the bottle with water and gave the lad drink.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and
  became an archer;
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>and he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran, he and his mother. And he took
  him a wife out of the land of Egypt.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>And it came to pass at the time, that Abimelech and Phicol the chief
  captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying:</span><quote><span>
   God is with thee in all that thou doest.
   </span><verse>23</verse><span>Now
   therefore, sware unto me here, that, by the help of God thou wilt not deal
   falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son’s son; but, that
   according to the kindness that I have shown unto thee, thou shalt do unto
   me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>And Abraham said, “I will swear.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>25</verse><span>And Abraham reproved Abimelech, because of a well of water which
  Abimelech’s servants had violently taken away.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>And Abimelech said, “Thou didst not tell me; and I know not who hath
  done this thing; neither yet have I heard that it was done until this
  day.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>27</verse><span>And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both
  of them made a covenant.
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
  </span><verse>29</verse><span>And Abimelech said unto Abraham, “What wilt thou do with these seven
  ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?”
  </span><verse>30</verse><span>And he said, “Seven ewe lambs shalt thou take at my hand, that they may
  be a witness unto me that I have digged this well.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>31</verse><span>And because they sware, both of them, wherefore he called that place
  Beer-Sheba;
  </span><verse>32</verse><span>and
  thus they made a covenant at Beer-Sheba; then Abimelech, and Phicol, the
  chief captain of his hosts, rose up, </span><verse>33</verse><span>and they planted a grove in
  Beer-Sheba, and called there on the name of the LORD; and they returned
  unto the land of the Philistines.
  </span><verse>34</verse><span>And Abraham
  worshiped the everlasting God, and sojourned in the land of the
  Philistines many days.

  The sacrifice of Isaac

 <chapter>22
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And it came to pass after these things, that God did try Abraham and
  said unto him, “Abraham.” And Abraham said, “Behold, here am I.”
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And the LORD said:</span><quote><span>
   Take now thy son, thine only Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into
   the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering, upon one of
   the mountains of which I will tell thee.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>And Abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass, and took
  two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for
  the burnt offering; and rose up, and went unto the place of which God
  had told him.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>Then on the third day,
  Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And Abraham said unto his young men, “Abide you
  here with the ass, and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come
  to you again.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon his
  back; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife, and Isaac his son;
  and they went both of them together.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, “My father!” And he
  said, “Here am I, my son.” And he said, “Behold the fire and the wood;
  but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?”
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>And Abraham said, “My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt
  offering.”
 </span></block>

 <block><span>So they went both of them together;
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>and they came to the place of which God had
  told him. And Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order,
  and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, upon the wood.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And Abraham stretched forth his hand and took
  the knife to slay his son.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And the angel of the
  LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, “Abraham! Abraham!” And
  Abraham said, “Here am I.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>And the angel said:</span><quote><span>
   Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou anything unto him; for
   now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son,
   thine only Isaac from me.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, behind a
  thicket, there was a ram caught in it by his horns. And Abraham went and
  took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering, in the stead of
  his son.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh; as it is said
  unto this day, “In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the second
  time, and said:</span><quote>
   <verse>16</verse><span>Thus saith the LORD, I have sworn by myself, that because thou hast
   done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only Isaac from
   me;
   </span><verse>17</verse><span>that in blessing I will bless thee; and in multiplying I will multiply
   thy seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand which is upon the
   seashore. And thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
   </span><verse>18</verse><span>and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because
   thou hast obeyed my voice.</span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went to
  Beer-Sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer-Sheba.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham,
  saying, “Behold, Milcah, she hath also borne children unto thy brother
  Nahor;</span><verse>21</verse><span>Huz is his firstborn, and Buz is his brother. And Kemuel is the father
  of Aram,
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>and
  Chesed, and Haza, and Bildash, and Jidlaph, and Beth-El;
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>and Beth-El begat Rebekah.”
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>These eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham’s
  brother; and his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah,

  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is now
  called Hebron, in the land of Canaan. And Abraham came to mourn for Sarah,
  and to weep for her,
  </span><dunder><span>his wife which was dead</span></dunder><span>.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and
  spake unto the sons of Heth, saying, </span><verse>4</verse><span>“I am a stranger and a sojourner with
  you; give me a possession of a buryingplace with
  you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him, “</span><verse>6</verse><span>Hear us, my lord; thou art a mighty prince among us; in the choicest of
  our sepulchers bury thou thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee
  his sepulcher, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.”

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, and
  to the children of Heth;
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>and he communed with them, saying, “If it be your mind that I should
  bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat Ephron the son of
  Zohar for me,
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath in the end of
  his field; for, as much money as it is worth he shall have, if he will
  give it me for a possession of a burying-place among you.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth. And Ephron, the Hittite,
  answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, among all of
  them that went in at the gates of the city, saying, “</span><verse>11</verse><span>Hearken, my lord, and hear me; the field I give thee, and the cave that
  is therein; I give it thee in the presence of the sons of my people; and
  I give it thee; therefore, bury thy dead.”

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>And Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land,

  saying, “I pray thee, hear me. If thou wilt take it of me, I will give
  thee money for the field, and I will bury my dead there, but I will give
  thee money for it.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him, “</span><verse>15</verse><span>My lord, hearken unto me; the land thou shalt have for four hundred
  shekels of silver; what shall that be betwixt me and thee? Bury
  therefore thy dead.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed unto Ephron the
  silver which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four
  hundred shekels of silver, which was current with the merchant.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before
  Mamre; the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that
  were in the field, and that were in all the borders round about, were
  made sure
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>unto Abraham for a possession, in the presence of the children of Heth,

   Put forth I pray thee thy hand under my

  the city, by a well of water, at evening, the time that women go out to
  draw water.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And he said:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee this day, that thou wouldst

  <verse>15</verse><span>And it came to pass, before he had done

  </span><verse>33</verse><span>And there was set before him food to eat;
  but he said, “I will not eat until I have told mine errand.” And Laban

    to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son.”
    </span><verse>39</verse><span>And I said unto my master, “Perhaps the woman
    will not follow me.”
    </span><verse>40</verse><span>And he said unto me, “The

    prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son, of my kindred, and
    of my father’s house;
    </span><verse>41</verse><span>then shalt thou be clear

   <block>
    <verse>42</verse><span>And I came this day unto the well, and said, “O LORD God of my master

    when the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, ‘Give me I

    </span><verse>44</verse><span>and if she say to me, ‘Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy

    said, “Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also;” so I drank, and
    she made the camels drink also.
    </span><verse>47</verse><span>And I asked her and said, “Whose daughter art thou?” And she said, “The

   Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of.

  strove with him.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>And they digged another well, and strove for that also; and he called
  the name of it Sitnah.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they
  strove not; and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, “For now

   increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my
   coming; and now, when shall I provide for mine own house also?</span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>31</verse><span>And he said, “What shall I give thee?” And Jacob said:</span><quote><span>
   Thou shalt not give me anything; if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will
   again feed and keep thy flock.
   </span><verse>32</verse><span>I will pass
   through all thy flock today, removing from thence all the speckled and
   spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted
   and speckled among the goats; and of such shall be my hire.
   </span><verse>33</verse><span>So shall my righteousness answer for me in time
   to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face; every one that is
   not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that
   shall be counted stolen with me.

 <block>
  <verse>34</verse><span>And Laban said, “Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.”
  </span><verse>35</verse><span>And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstreaked and
  spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and every
  one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and
  gave them into the hand of his sons.
  </span><verse>36</verse><span>And he set three days’ journey betwixt himself and Jacob; and Jacob fed
  the rest of Laban’s flocks.
  </span><verse>37</verse><span>And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chestnut
  tree; and pilled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which
  was in the rods.
  </span><verse>38</verse><span>And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the
  gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they
  should conceive when they came to drink.
  </span><verse>39</verse><span>And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle
  ringstreaked, speckled, and spotted.
  </span><verse>40</verse><span>And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks
  toward the ringstreaked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he
  put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban’s cattle.
  </span><verse>41</verse><span>And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive, that
  Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that
  they might conceive among the rods.
  </span><verse>42</verse><span>But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in; so the feebler
  were Laban’s, and the stronger Jacob’s.
  </span><verse>43</verse><span>And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and
  maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.

    <verse>41</verse><span>Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen

   </span><verse>10</verse><span>I am not worthy of the

   Jacob’s; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau; and, behold, also he is
   behind us.”
   </span><verse>19</verse><span>And so commanded he the second and

  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the
  damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying:</span><quote><span>
   Get me this damsel to wife.

  <verse>5</verse><span>And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter; now his sons

  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with
  him.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it; and the
  men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly
  in Israel in lying with Jacob’s daughter; which thing ought not to be
  done.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>And Hamor communed with them, saying:</span><quote><span>
   The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter; I pray you give her
   him to wife.
   </span><verse>9</verse><span>And make ye marriages with us, and
   give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you.

  <verse>11</verse><span>And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren:</span><quote><span>
   Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.
   </span><verse>12</verse><span>Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will
   give according as ye shall say unto me; but give me the damsel to wife.

  <verse>13</verse><span>And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father

   We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised;
   for that were a reproach unto us;

  <verse>18</verse><span>And their words pleased Hamor and Shechem Hamor’s son.

  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and
  communed with the men of their city, saying:</span><quote>
   <verse>21</verse><span>These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land,

  <verse>24</verse><span>And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of

  </span><verse>25</verse><span>And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of
  the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brethren, took each man his
  sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and
  took Dinah out of Shechem’s house, and went out.
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because
  they had defiled their sister.
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which

  <verse>1</verse><span>And God said unto Jacob:</span><quote><span>
   Arise, go up to Beth-El, and dwell there; and make there an altar unto
   God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy
   brother.
  </span></quote>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with

   Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change
   your garments;
   </span><verse>3</verse><span>and let us arise, and go up to
   Beth-El; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the

  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand,

  under the oak which was by Shechem.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And they journeyed; and the terror of God was upon the cities that were
  round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>So Jacob came to Luz which is in the land of Canaan, that is, Beth-El,
  he and all the people that were with him.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And he built there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el; because
  there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother.

  <verse>11</verse><span>And God said unto him:</span><quote><span>

  <verse>18</verse><span>And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that

  <verse>1</verse><span>Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of
  Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of
  Zibeon the Hivite;
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>and Bashemath Ishmael’s daughter, sister of Nebajoth.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel;

  <verse>6</verse><span>And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the
  persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his
  substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into the
  country from the face of his brother Jacob.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>For their riches were more than that they might dwell together; and the
  land wherin they were strangers could not bear them because of their
  cattle.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir; Esau is Edom.
 </span></block>

  <verse>9</verse><span>And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in

  Joseph
 </span></heading>

 <block><span>
  Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his
  brethren; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of
  Zilpah, his father’s wives; and Joseph brought unto his father their evil
  report.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>Now Israel loved Joseph more than all
  his children, because he was the son of his old age; and he made him a
  coat of many colors.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his
  brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren; and they hated
  him yet the more.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And he said unto them:</span><quote><span>
   Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed.
   </span><verse>7</verse><span>For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the
   field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your
   sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>And his brethren said to him:</span><quote><span>
   Shalt thou indeed reign over us? Or shalt thou indeed have dominion over
   us?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and
  said:</span><quote><span>
   Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and behold, the sun and the moon and
   the eleven stars made obeisance to me.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>And he told it to his father, and to his brethren; and his father
  rebuked him, and said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy
   brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>And his brethren went to feed their father’s flock in Shechem.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And Israel said unto Joseph, “Do not thy brethren feed the flock in
  Shechem? Come, and I will send thee unto them.” And he said to him,
  “Here am I.”
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And he said to him:</span><quote><span>
   Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with
   the flocks; and bring me word again.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>And a certain man found him, and, behold, he
  was wandering in the field; and the man asked him, saying, “What seekest
  thou?”
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And he said, “I seek my brethren; tell
  me, I pray thee, where they feed their flocks.”
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And the man said, “They are departed hence; for
  I heard them say, ‘Let us go to Dothan.’”
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  And Joseph went after his brethren and found them in Dothan.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>And when they saw him afar off, even before he
  came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And they said one to another:</span><quote><span>
   Behold, this dreamer cometh.
   </span><verse>20</verse><span>Come now
   therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will
   say, “Some evil beast hath devoured him;” and we shall see what will
   become of his dreams.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said,
  “Let us not kill him.”
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>And Reuben said unto them:</span><quote><span>
   Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and
   lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver
   him to his father again.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they
  stripped Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colors that was on
  him;
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>and they took him, and cast him into a pit; and the pit was empty,
  there was no water in it.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>And they sat down to eat bread; and they lifted up their eyes and
  looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmaelites came from Gilead, with
  their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down
  to Egypt.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>And Judah said unto his brethren:</span><quote><span>
   What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood?
   </span><verse>27</verse><span>Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites,
   and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh.

 <block><span>
  And his brethren were content.
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>Then there
  passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out
  of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of
  silver; and they brought Joseph into Egypt.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>29</verse><span>And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the
  pit; and he rent his clothes.
  </span><verse>30</verse><span>And he returned unto his brethren, and said, “The child is not; and I,
  whither shall I go?”
  </span><verse>31</verse><span>And they took Joseph’s coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped
  the coat in the blood;
  </span><verse>32</verse><span>and they sent the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their
  father; and said, “This have we found; know now whether it be thy son’s
  coat or no.”
  </span><verse>33</verse><span>And he knew it, and said, “It is my son’s coat; an evil beast hath
  devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>34</verse><span>And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and
  mourned for his son many days.
  </span><verse>35</verse><span>And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he
  refused to be comforted; and he said, “For I will go down into the grave
  unto my son mourning.” Thus his father wept for him.

  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And the thing which he did displeased the LORD; wherefore he slew him
  also.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter-in-law, “Remain a widow at thy
  father’s house, till Shelah my son be grown;” for he said, “Lest
  peradventure he die also, as his brethren did.” And Tamar went and dwelt
  in her father’s house.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah’s wife died; and
  Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he
  and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And it was told Tamar, saying, “Behold, thy father-in-law goeth up to
  Timnath to shear his sheep.”
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And she put her widow’s garments off from her, and covered her with a
  veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way
  to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given
  unto him to wife.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a harlot; because she had
  covered her face.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And he turned unto her by the way, and said, “Go to, I pray thee, let
  me come in and lie with thee.” (For he knew not that she was his
  daughter-in-law.)
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  And she said, “What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in and lie
  with me?”
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And he said, “I will send thee a kid
  from the flock.” And she said, “Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send
  it?”
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>And he said, “What pledge shall I give
  thee?” And she said, “Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is
  in thine hand.” And he gave it her, and came in and slept with her, and
  she conceived by him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>And she arose, and went away, and laid by her veil from her, and put on
  the garments of her widowhood.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to
  receive his pledge from the woman’s hand; but he found her not.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>Then he asked the men
  of that place, saying, “Where is the harlot, that was openly by the
  wayside?” And they said, “There was no harlot in this place.”
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>And he returned to Judah, and said, “I cannot
  find her. And also the men of the place said that there was no harlot in
  this place.”
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>And Judah said, “Let her take it
  to her, lest we be shamed; behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not
  found her.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah,
  saying, “Tamar thy daughter-in-law hath played the harlot; and also,
  behold, she is with child by whoredom.”
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  And Judah said, “Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>25</verse><span>When she was brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, “Buy
  the man, whose these are, am I with child.” And she said, “Discern, I
  pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.”
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>And Judah acknowledged them, and said, “She hath been more righteous
  than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son.” And he knew her
  again no more.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>27</verse><span>And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins
  were in her womb.
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand;
  and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread saying,
  “This came out first.”
  </span><verse>29</verse><span>And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his
  brother came out; and she said, “How hast thou broken forth? This breach
  be upon thee.” Therefore his name was called Pharez.
  </span><verse>30</verse><span>And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon
  his hand; and his name was called Zarah.

  Joseph and Potiphar’s wife
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>39
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of
  Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of
  the Ishmaelites, which had brought him down thither.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was
  in the house of his master the Egyptian.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made
  all that he did to prosper in his hand.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him; and he made him
  overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his
  house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian’s
  house for Joseph’s sake; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that
  he had in the house, and in the field.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And he left all that he had in Joseph’s hand; and he knew not aught he
  had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly person,
  and well favored.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>And it came to pass after these things, that his master’s wife cast her
  eyes upon Joseph; and she said, “Lie with me.”
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>But he refused, and said unto his master’s wife:</span><quote><span>
   Behold, my master knoweth not what is with me in the house, and he hath
   committed all that he hath to my hand;
   </span><verse>9</verse><span>there is
   none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back anything from
   me but thee, because thou art his wife; how then can I do this great
   wickedness, and sin against God?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he
  hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house to
  do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there
  within.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And she caught him by his garment, saying, “Lie with me;” and he left
  his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her
  hand, and was fled forth,
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>that she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying,
  “See, he hath brought in a Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie
  with me, and I cried with a loud voice;
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>and it came to pass, when he heard that I
  lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled,
  and got him out.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And she spake unto him according to these words, saying:</span><quote><span>
   The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to
   mock me;
   </span><verse>18</verse><span>and it came to pass, as I lifted up my
   voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which
  she spake unto him, saying, “After this manner did thy servant to me;”
  that his wrath was kindled.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And Joseph’s master took him, and put him into the prison, a place
  where the king’s prisoners were bound; and he was there in the
  prison.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>But the LORD was with Joseph, and showed him mercy, and gave him favor
  in the sight of the keeper of the prison.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph’s hand all the
  prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was
  the overseer of it.
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>The keeper of the prison looked not to anything that was under his
  hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which he did, the LORD

  Joseph interprets the dreams of the butler and chef
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>40
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of
  Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the chief of
  the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into
  the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served
  them; and they continued a season in ward.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night,
  each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and
  the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the prison.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them, and,
  behold, they were sad.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And he asked Pharaoh’s officers that were with him in the ward of his
  lord’s house, saying, “Wherefore look ye so sadly today?”
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>And they said unto him, “We have dreamed a dream, and there is no
  interpreter of it.”
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  And Joseph said unto them, “Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell me
  them, I pray you.”
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>And the chief butler told his
  dream to Joseph, and said to him:
  </span><quote><span>
   In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;
   </span><verse>10</verse><span>and
   in the vine were three branches; and it was as though it budded, and her
   blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes;
   </span><verse>11</verse><span>and Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand; and I took
   the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and I gave the cup into
   Pharaoh’s hand.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>And Joseph said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   This is the interpretation of it: the three branches are three days;
   </span><verse>13</verse><span>yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up
   thine head, and restore thee unto thy place; and thou shalt deliver
   Pharaoh’s cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his
   butler.
   </span><verse>14</verse><span>But think on me when it shall be well
   with thee, and show kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me
   unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house;
   </span><verse>15</verse><span>for indeed I was stolen away out of the land of
   the Hebrews; and here also have I done nothing that they should put me
   into the dungeon.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto
  Joseph:</span><quote><span>
   I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white baskets on my head;
   </span><verse>17</verse><span>and in the uppermost basket there was of all
   manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the
   basket upon my head.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>And Joseph answered and said:</span><quote><span>
   This is the interpretation thereof: the three baskets are three days;
   </span><verse>19</verse><span>yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy
   head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat
   thy flesh from off thee.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, that
  he made a feast unto all his servants; and he lifted up the head of the
  chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave
  the cup into Pharaoh’s hand;
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>But he hanged the chief baker; as Joseph had interpreted to them.
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.

  Pharaoh’s dream
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>41
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed;
  and, behold, he stood by the river.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well-favored kine and
  fat-fleshed; and they fed in a meadow.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river,
  ill-favored and lean-fleshed; and stood by the other kine upon the brink
  of the river.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And the ill-favored and lean-fleshed kine did eat up the seven well-
  favored and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>And he slept and dreamed the second time; and, behold, seven ears of
  corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up
  after them.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And
  Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he
  sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men
  thereof; and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could
  interpret them unto Pharaoh.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying:</span><quote><span>
   I do remember my faults this day;
   </span><verse>10</verse><span>Pharaoh was
   wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard’s
   house, both me and the chief baker;
   </span><verse>11</verse><span>and we
   dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to
   the interpretation of his dream.
   </span><verse>12</verse><span>And there was
   there with us a young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard;
   and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man
   according to his dream he did interpret.
   </span><verse>13</verse><span>And it
   came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine
   office, and him he hanged.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out
  of the dungeon; and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came
  in unto Pharaoh.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>And Pharaoh said unto Joseph:</span><quote><span>
   I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it; and I
   have heard say of thee that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying:</span><quote><span>
   It is not in me; God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>And Pharaoh said unto Joseph:</span><quote>
   <block><span>
    In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river;
    </span><verse>18</verse><span>and, behold, there came up out of the river
    seven kine, fatfleshed and well-favored; and they fed in a meadow;
    </span><verse>19</verse><span>and, behold, seven other kine came up after
    them, poor and very ill-favored and
    lean-fleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness;
    </span><verse>20</verse><span>and the lean in the ill-favored kine did eat up
    the first seven fat kine;
    </span><verse>21</verse><span>and when they had
    eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they
    were still ill-favored, as at the beginning. So I awoke.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>22</verse><span>And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk,
    full and good;
    </span><verse>23</verse><span>and, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east
    wind, sprung up after them;
    </span><verse>24</verse><span>and the thin ears devoured the seven good ears; and I told this unto
    the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.</span></block>

  </quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>25</verse><span>And Joseph said unto Pharaoh:</span><quote>
   <block><span>The dream of Pharaoh is one; God hath showed Pharaoh what he is about to
   do.
    </span><verse>26</verse><span>The seven good kine are seven years; and
    the seven good ears are seven years; the dream is one.
    </span><verse>27</verse><span>And the seven thin and ill-favored kine that
    came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with
    the east wind shall be seven years of famine.
    </span><verse>28</verse><span>This is the thing which I have spoken unto
    Pharaoh; what God is about to do he showeth unto Pharaoh.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>29</verse><span>Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land
    of Egypt;
    </span><verse>30</verse><span>and there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the
    plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall
    consume the land;
    </span><verse>31</verse><span>and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine
    following; for it shall be very grievous.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>32</verse><span>And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because
    the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.
    </span><verse>33</verse><span>Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him
    over the land of Egypt.
    </span><verse>34</verse><span>Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and
    take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous
    years.
    </span><verse>35</verse><span>And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay
    up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.
    </span><verse>36</verse><span>And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of
    famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not

   </span><verse>19</verse><span>My lord asked his servants, saying,

   and his father loveth him.”
   </span><verse>21</verse><span>And thou saidst

   him.”

   leave his father; for if he should leave his father, his father would
   die.”

   not since:

   </span><verse>30</verse><span>Now therefore when I come to thy
   servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is
   bound up in the lad’s life;
   </span><verse>31</verse><span>it shall come to
   pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die; and thy
   servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with
   sorrow to the grave.
   </span><verse>32</verse><span>For thy servant became
   surety for the lad unto my father, saying, “If I bring him not unto thee,
   then I shall bear the blame to my father forever.”
   </span><verse>33</verse><span>Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant
   abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with
   his brethren.
   </span><verse>34</verse><span>For how shall I go up to my
   father, and the lad be not with me? Lest peradventure I see the evil that

    unto my seed, the land for an everlasting

    to be a servant unto me, in saving my house from
    death; in delivering my people, thy brethren, from
    famine which was sore in the land; wherefore the God of thy fathers shall bless thee, and the fruit of thy loins, that they shall be blessed
    above thy brethren, and above thy father’s house;
    for thou hast prevailed, and thy father’s house hath bowed down unto thee, even as it was shown unto thee, before thou wast
    sold into Egypt by the hands of thy brethren;
    wherefore thy brethren shall bow down unto thee,
    from generation to generation, unto the fruit of thy loins forever; for
    thou shalt be a light unto my people, to deliver

   <block><span>I die, and go unto my fathers;
    </span><dunder><span>and I go down to my grave with joy. The God of my father Jacob be with you, to deliver you out of affliction in the days
    of your bondage; for the Lord hath visited me, and I have obtained a promise of the

    out of my loins</span></dunder><span>;
    </span><dunder><span>and unto thee, whom my father Jacob hath named Israel, a prophet; (not

    shall be made manifest unto them in the latter days, in the

  <dunder><span>A seer shall the Lord my God raise up, who shall be a choice seer unto the

  fathers unto me:</span><quote>
    <block><span>A choice seer will I raise up out of the fruit of thy loins, and he shall
    be esteemed highly among the fruit of thy loins;
    and unto him will I give commandment that he shall
    do a work for the fruit of thy loins, his brethren. And he shall bring
    them to the knowledge of the covenants which I have
    made with thy fathers; and he shall do whatsoever
    work I shall command him. And I will make him great in mine eyes, for he shall do my work; and he shall be great like unto him
    whom I have said I would
    raise up unto you, to deliver my people, O house of Israel, out of the land of Egypt; for a seer will I raise up to deliver my people out
    of the land of Egypt; and he shall be called Moses.
    And by this name he shall know that he is of thy
    house; for he shall be nursed by the king’s daughter, and shall be called
    her son.</span></block>

    <block><span>And again, a seer will I raise up out of the fruit of thy loins, and unto
    him will I give power to
    bring forth my word unto the seed of thy loins; and not to the bringing forth of my word only, saith the Lord, but to the convincing
    them of my word, which shall have already gone
    forth among them in the last days; wherefore the
    fruit of thy loins shall write, and the fruit of the loins of Judah
    shall write; and that which shall be written by the
    fruit of thy loins, and also that which shall be
    written by the fruit of the loins of Judah, shall grow together unto the confounding of false doctrines, and laying down of contentions,
    and establishing peace among the fruit of thy
    loins, and bringing them to a knowledge of their
    fathers in the latter days; and also to the knowledge of my
    covenants, saith the Lord. And out of weakness
    shall he be made strong, in that day when my work
    shall go forth among all my people, which shall restore them, who are of the house of Israel, in the last days.</span></block>

    <block><span>And that seer will I bless, and they that seek to destroy him shall be
    confounded; for this promise I give unto you; for I
    will remember you from generation to generation;
    and his name shall be called Joseph, and it shall be after the name
    of his father; and he shall be like unto you; for
    the thing which the Lord shall bring forth by his
    hand shall bring my people unto salvation.</span></block>

  <verse>8</verse><span>Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.

   Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than

  <verse>11</verse><span>Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their

  </span><verse>12</verse><span>But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew.
  And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigor;
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in mortar, and in

  <verse>15</verse><span>And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name

  <verse>1</verse><span>And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter

  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And
  the woman conceived, and bare a son; and when she saw him that he was a
  goodly child, she hid him three months.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And when
  she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and
  daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she
  laid it in the flags by the river’s brink.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And
  his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river; and

  among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And when she had opened it, she saw the child; and, behold, the babe
  wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, “This is one of the
  Hebrews’ children.”

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>Then said his sister to Pharaoh’s daughter:</span><quote><span>
   Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Go.” And the maid went and called

  </span><verse>9</verse><span>And Pharaoh’s daughter said unto her, “Take this child away, and nurse
  it for me, and I will give thee thy wages.” And the woman took the
  child, and nursed it.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh’s daughter, and he
  became her son.
  And she called his name Moses; and she said, “Because I drew him out of
  the water.”

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went
  out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens; and he spied an
  Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brethren.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no
  man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews
  strove together; and he said to him that did the wrong, “Wherefore
  smitest thou thy fellow?”
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And he said, “Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? Intendest
  thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian?” And Moses feared, and
  said, “Surely this thing is known.”
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>Now when Pharaoh heard this thing he sought to slay Moses. But Moses

  sat down by a well.

  helped them, and watered their flock.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, “How is it that ye
  are come so soon today?”
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And they said, “An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the
  shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock.”

  have left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread.”

  <verse>23</verse><span>And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died;

  Water from the rock at Meribah

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the
  wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of
  the LORD, and pitched in Rephidim; and there was no water for the people
  to drink.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, “Give us water
  that we may drink.” And Moses said unto them, “Why chide ye with me?
  Wherefore do ye tempt the LORD?”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured
  against Moses, and said, “Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up
  out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with
  thirst?”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying:</span><quote><span>
   What shall I do unto this people? They be almost ready to stone me.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>And the LORD said unto Moses:</span><quote><span>
   Go on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and
   thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go.
   </span><verse>6</verse><span>Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the
   rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water
   out of it, that the people may drink.

 <block><span>And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And he called the name of the place Massah, and

  Amalek; tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God

 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek; and
  Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel
  prevailed; and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>But Moses’ hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under
  him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one
  on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were
  steady until the going down of the sun.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>And the LORD said unto Moses:</span><quote><span>

 <chapter>18
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>When Jethro, the high priest of Midian, Moses’ father-in-law, heard of
  all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and that the
  LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt;
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>then Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, took Zipporah, Moses’ wife, after he
  had sent her back,
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>and her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom; for he
  said, “I have been an alien in a strange land;”
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>and the name of the other was Eliezer; “for the God of my father,” said
  he, “was mine help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>And Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife unto
  Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God;

  said unto Moses, “I thy father-in-law Jethro am come unto thee, and thy
  wife, and her two sons with her.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and did obeisance, and
  kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into
  the tent.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>And Moses told his father-in-law all that the LORD had done unto
  Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, and all the travail that
  had come upon them by the way, and how the LORD delivered them.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>And Jethro
  rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, whom he
  had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And Jethro said:
  </span><quote><span>
   Blessed be the LORD, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the
   Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people
   from under the hand of the Egyptians.
   </span><verse>11</verse><span>Now I know that the LORD is greater
   than all gods; for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above
   them.

  <verse>12</verse><span>And Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for
  God; and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with
  Moses’ father-in-law before God.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people; and
  the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And when
  Moses’ father-in-law saw all that he did to the people, he said:
  </span><quote><span>
   What is this thing that thou doest to the people? Why sittest thou thyself
   alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And Moses said unto his father-in-law:</span><quote><span>
   Because the people come unto me to inquire of God;
   </span><verse>16</verse><span>when they have a matter, they come unto me; and
   I judge between one and another, and I do make them know the statutes of
   God, and his laws.
  </span></quote>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>And Moses’ father-in-law said unto him:</span><quote>
   <block><span>The thing that thou doest is not good.
    </span><verse>18</verse><span>Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and
    this people that is with thee; for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou
    art not able to perform it thyself alone.
    </span><verse>19</verse><span>Now
    unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee; be
    thou for the people to God-ward, that thou mayest bring the causes unto
    God;
    </span><verse>20</verse><span>and thou shalt teach them ordinances and
    laws, and shalt show them the way wherein they must walk, and the work
    that they must do.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>21</verse><span>Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as
    fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them,
    to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties,
    and rulers of tens;
    </span><verse>22</verse><span>and let them judge the people at all seasons; and it shall be, that
    every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter
    they shall judge; so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear
    the burden with thee.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>23</verse><span>If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt
    be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in
    peace.</span></block>

  <verse>24</verse><span>So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that

  </span><verse>25</verse><span>And
  Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the
  people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of
  the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert of
  Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped before
  the mount.
 </span></block>

   third day; for the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all
   the people upon mount Sinai.
   </span><verse>12</verse><span>And thou shalt set
   bounds unto the people round about, saying, “Take heed to yourselves, that
   ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it; whosoever toucheth
   the mount shall be surely put to death;
   </span><verse>13</verse><span>there
   shall not a hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through;

  and they stood at the nether part of the mount.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD descended
  upon it in fire; and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a
  furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and
  louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount; and
  the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses went up.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>And the LORD said unto Moses:</span><quote><span>
   Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto the LORD to gaze,
   and many of them perish.
   </span><verse>22</verse><span>And let the priests
   also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD

    thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that

  <verse>1</verse><span>And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them:</span><quote>
   <block>
    <verse>2</verse><span>Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, these are the beasts which
    ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>3</verse><span>Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is cloven-footed, and cheweth the cud,
    among the beasts, that shall ye eat.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>4</verse><span>Nevertheless, these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of
    them that divide the hoof; as the camel, because he cheweth the cud, but
    divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof;
    he is unclean unto you.
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he
    is unclean unto you.
    </span><verse>7</verse><span>And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he
    cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you.
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcass shall ye not touch;
    they are unclean to you.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>9</verse><span>These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters; whatsoever hath fins
    and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye
    eat.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>10</verse><span>And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers,
    of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which is in the
    waters, they shall be an abomination unto you;
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>they shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their
    flesh, but ye shall have their carcasses in abomination.
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be an
    abomination unto you.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>13</verse><span>And these are they which ye shall have in abomination among the fowls;
    they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination; the eagle, and the
    ossifrage, and the ospray.
    </span><verse>14</verse><span>And the vulture, and the kite after his kind;
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>every raven after his kind;
    </span><verse>16</verse><span>and the owl, and the nighthawk, and the cuckoo, and the hawk after his
    kind,
    </span><verse>17</verse><span>and the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,
    </span><verse>18</verse><span>and the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle,
    </span><verse>19</verse><span>and the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the
    bat.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>20</verse><span>All fowls that creep, going upon all four, shall be an abomination unto
    you.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>21</verse><span>Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon all
    four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon the earth:
    </span><verse>22</verse><span>even these of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind, and the bald
    locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and the
    grasshopper after his kind.
    </span><verse>23</verse><span>But all other flying creeping things, which have four feet, shall be an
    abomination unto you.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>24</verse><span>And for these ye shall be unclean; whosoever toucheth the carcass of
    them shall be unclean until the even.
    </span><verse>25</verse><span>And whosoever beareth aught of the carcass of them shall wash his
    clothes, and be unclean until the even.
    </span><verse>26</verse><span>The carcasses of every beast which divideth the hoof, and is not
    cloven-footed, nor cheweth the cud, are unclean unto you; every one that
    toucheth them shall be unclean.
    </span><verse>27</verse><span>And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts that go
    on all four, those are unclean unto you; whoso toucheth their carcass
    shall be unclean until the even.
    </span><verse>28</verse><span>And he that beareth the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and be
    unclean until the even; they are unclean unto you.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>29</verse><span>These also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things that
    creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after
    his kind.
    </span><verse>30</verse><span>And the ferret, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the snail, and
    the mole.
    </span><verse>31</verse><span>These are unclean to you among all that creep; whosoever doth touch
    them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the even.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>32</verse><span>And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it
    shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin,
    or sack, whatsoever vessel it be, wherein any work is done, it must be
    put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; so it shall be
    cleansed.
    </span><verse>33</verse><span>And every earthen vessel, whereinto any of them falleth, whatsoever is
    in it shall be unclean; and ye shall break it.
    </span><verse>34</verse><span>Of all meat which may be eaten, that on which such water cometh shall
    be unclean; and all drink that may be drunk in every such vessel shall
    be unclean.
    </span><verse>35</verse><span>And everything whereupon any part of their carcass falleth shall be
    unclean; whether it be oven, or ranges for pots, they shall be broken
    down; for they are unclean, and shall be unclean unto you.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>36</verse><span>Nevertheless a fountain or pit, wherein there is plenty of water, shall
    be clean; but that which toucheth their carcass shall be unclean.
    </span><verse>37</verse><span>And if any part of their carcass fall upon any sowing seed which is to
    be sown, it shall be clean.
    </span><verse>38</verse><span>But if any water be put upon the seed, and any part of their carcass fall thereon, it shall
    be unclean unto you.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>39</verse><span>And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the
    carcass thereof shall be unclean until the even.
    </span><verse>40</verse><span>And he that eateth of the carcass of it shall wash his clothes, and be
    unclean until the even; he also that beareth the carcass of it shall
    wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>41</verse><span>And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth shall be an
    abomination; it shall not be eaten.
    </span><verse>42</verse><span>Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all four, or
    whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that creep upon the
    earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are an abomination.
    </span><verse>43</verse><span>Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that
    creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye
    should be defiled thereby.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>44</verse><span>For I am the LORD your God; ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves, and
    ye shall be holy; for I am holy; neither shall ye defile yourselves with
    any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
    </span><verse>45</verse><span>For I am the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt, to be
    your God; ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>46</verse><span>This is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living
    creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth
    upon the earth;
    </span><verse>47</verse><span>to make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between the
    beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten.</span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying:</span><quote>
   <block>
    <verse>2</verse><span>Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, if a woman have conceived
    seed, and borne a man child, then she shall be unclean seven days;
    according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be
    unclean.
    </span><verse>3</verse><span>And in the eighth day, the man child shall be circumcised.
    </span><verse>4</verse><span>And she shall then continue in the time of her purifying which shall be
    three and thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into
    the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled.
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>But if she bear a maid child, she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her
    separation; and she shall continue in the time of her purifying
    threescore and six days.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>6</verse><span>And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or for a
    daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering,
    and a young pigeon, or a turtle dove, for a sin offering, unto the door
    of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest;
    </span><verse>7</verse><span>who shall offer it before the LORD, and make an atonement for her; and
    she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood. This is the law for
    her that hath borne a male or a female.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>8</verse><span>And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two
    turtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt offering, and the

    her, and she shall be clean.</span></block>

  <verse>1</verse><span>And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying:</span><quote>
   <block>
    <verse>2</verse><span>When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or
    bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh like the plague of
    leprosy; then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of
    his sons the priests;
    </span><verse>3</verse><span>and the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh; and
    when the hair in the plague is turned white, and the plague
    in sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is a plague of leprosy;
    and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>4</verse><span>If the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and in sight be
    not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white; then
    the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague seven days;
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>and the priest shall look on him the seventh day; and, behold, if the
    plague in his sight be at a stay, and the plague spread not in the skin;
    then the priest shall shut him up seven days more;</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>6</verse><span>And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day; and, behold, if
    the plague be somewhat dark, and the plague spread not in the skin, the
    priest shall pronounce him clean; it is but a scab; and he shall wash
    his clothes, and be clean.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>7</verse><span>But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he hath been
    seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen of the priest
    again;
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>and if the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the skin,
    then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a leprosy.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>9</verse><span>When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought unto
    the priest;
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>and the priest shall see him; and, behold, if the rising be white in
    the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and there be quick raw
    flesh in the rising;
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>it is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall
    pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up; for he is
    unclean.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>12</verse><span>And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover
    all the skin of him that hath the plague from his head even to his foot,
    wheresoever the priest looketh;
    </span><verse>13</verse><span>then the priest shall consider; and, behold, if the leprosy have
    covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean that hath the
    plague; it is all turned white; he is clean.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>14</verse><span>But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be
    unclean; for the raw flesh is unclean; it is a leprosy.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>16</verse><span>Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he shall
    come unto the priest;
    </span><verse>17</verse><span>and the priest shall see him; and, behold, if the plague be turned into
    white; then the priest shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague;
    he is clean.</span></block>

    <verse>18</verse><span>The flesh also, in which, even in the skin thereof, was a boil, and is
    healed,
    </span><verse>19</verse><span>and in the place of the boil there be a white rising, or a bright spot,
    white, and somewhat reddish, and it be showed to the priest;
    </span><verse>20</verse><span>and if, when the priest seeth it, behold, it be in sight lower than the
    skin, and the hair thereof be turned white; the priest shall pronounce
    him unclean; it is a plague of leprosy broken out of the boil.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>21</verse><span>But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hairs
    therein, and if it be not lower than the skin, but be somewhat dark;
    then the priest shall shut him up seven days;
    </span><verse>22</verse><span>and if it spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall
    pronounce him unclean; it is a plague.
    </span><verse>23</verse><span>But if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not, it is a
    burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>24</verse><span>Or if there be any flesh, in the skin whereof there is a hot burning,
    and the quick flesh that burneth have a white bright spot, somewhat
    reddish, or white;
    </span><verse>25</verse><span>then the priest shall look upon it; and, behold, if the hair in the
    bright spot be turned white, and it be in sight deeper than the skin; it
    is a leprosy broken out of the burning; wherefore the priest shall
    pronounce him unclean; it is the plague of leprosy.
    </span><verse>26</verse><span>But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hair in
    the bright spot, and it be no lower than the other skin, but be somewhat
    dark; then the priest shall shut him up
    seven days;
    </span><verse>27</verse><span>and the priest shall look upon him
    the seventh day; and if it be spread much abroad in the skin, then the
    priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is the plague of leprosy.
    </span><verse>28</verse><span>And if the bright spot stay in his place, and
    spread not in the skin, but it be somewhat dark; it is a rising of the
    burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean; for it is an
    inflammation of the burning.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>29</verse><span>If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard;
    </span><verse>30</verse><span>then the priest shall see the plague; and, behold, if it be insight
    deeper than the skin, and there be in it a yellow thin hair; then the
    priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a dry scall, even a leprosy
    upon the head or beard.
    </span><verse>31</verse><span>And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and, behold, it be
    not in sight deeper than the skin, and that there is no black hair in
    it; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague of the scall
    seven days;
    </span><verse>32</verse><span>and in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague; and,
    behold, if the scall spread not, and there be in it no yellow hair, and
    the scall be not in sight deeper than the skin;
    </span><verse>33</verse><span>he shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the priest
    shall shut up him that hath the scall seven days more;
    </span><verse>34</verse><span>and in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall; and, behold,
    if the scall be not spread in the skin, nor be in sight deeper than the
    skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean; and he shall wash his
    clothes, and be clean.
    </span><verse>35</verse><span>But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing;
    </span><verse>36</verse><span>then the priest shall look on him; and, behold, if the scall be spread
    in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow hair; he is unclean.
    </span><verse>37</verse><span>But if the scall be in his sight at a stay, and that there is black
    hair grown up therein; the scall is healed, he is clean; and the priest
    shall pronounce him clean.</span></block>

    <verse>38</verse><span>If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright spots,
    even white bright spots;
    </span><verse>39</verse><span>then the priest shall look; and, behold, if the bright spots in the
    skin of their flesh be darkish white, it is a freckled spot that groweth
    in the skin; he is clean.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>40</verse><span>And the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he is bald; yet is he
    clean.
    </span><verse>41</verse><span>And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head toward
    his face, he is forehead bald; yet is he clean.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>42</verse><span>And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white reddish
    sore; it is a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or his bald forehead.
    </span><verse>43</verse><span>Then the priest shall look upon it; and, behold, if the rising of the
    sore be white reddish in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as the
    leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh;
    </span><verse>44</verse><span>he is a leprous man, he is unclean; the priest shall pronounce him
    utterly unclean; his plague is in his head.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>45</verse><span>And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and his
    head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip, and shall
    cry, “Unclean, unclean.”
    </span><verse>46</verse><span>All the days wherein the plague shall be in him he shall be defiled; he
    is unclean; he shall dwell alone; without the camp shall his habitation
    be.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>47</verse><span>The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it be a
    woolen garment, or a linen garment;

    a skin, or in any thing made of skin;
    </span><verse>49</verse><span>and if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the
    skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it is
    a plague of leprosy, and shall be showed unto the priest;
    </span><verse>50</verse><span>and the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up it that hath the
    plague seven days;
    </span><verse>51</verse><span>and he shall look on the plague on the seventh day; if the plague be
    spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in a skin,
    or in any work that is made of skin; the plague is a fretting leprosy;
    it is unclean.
    </span><verse>52</verse><span>He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in woolen
    or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague is; for it is a
    fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>53</verse><span>And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not spread in

    behold, if the plague have not changed his color, and the plague be not
    spread, it is unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire; it is fret
    inward, whether it be bare within or without.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>56</verse><span>And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague be somewhat dark after
    the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the garment, or out of
    the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof;
    </span><verse>57</verse><span>and if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the

    </span><verse>58</verse><span>And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of skin it
    be, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from them, then it
    shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean.

    </span><verse>4</verse><span>then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed
    two birds alive and clean, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop;
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>and the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an
    earthen vessel over running water.
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and the
    scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the

    shall serve thee unto the year of jubilee;
    </span><verse>41</verse><span>and then shall he depart from thee, both he and his children with him,
    and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his
    fathers shall he return.

    may redeem himself.
    </span><verse>50</verse><span>And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was
    sold to him unto the year of jubilee; and the price of his sale shall be
    according unto the number of years, according to the time of a hired
    servant shall it be with him.
    </span><verse>51</verse><span>If there be yet many years behind, according unto them he shall give

  <verse>1</verse><span>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying:</span><quote>
   <block>
    <verse>2</verse><span>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, when a man shall
    make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the LORD by thy
    estimation.
    </span><verse>3</verse><span>And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto
    sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver,
    after the shekel of the sanctuary.
    </span><verse>4</verse><span>And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels.
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, then thy
    estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten
    shekels.
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy
    estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the
    female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver.
    </span><verse>7</verse><span>And if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a male, then thy
    estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten
    shekels.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>8</verse><span>But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present himself
    before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to his
    ability that vowed shall the priest value him.
    </span><verse>9</verse><span>And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the LORD, all
    that any man giveth of such unto the LORD shall be holy.
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a
    good; and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and the
    exchange thereof shall be holy.
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>And if it be any unclean
    beast, of which they do not offer a sacrifice unto the LORD, then he shall
    present the beast before the priest;
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>and the
    priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad; as thou valuest it, who
    art the priest, so shall it be.
    </span><verse>13</verse><span>But if he will
    at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth part thereof unto thy
    estimation.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>14</verse><span>And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the LORD, then
    the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad; as the priest
    shall estimate it, so shall it stand.
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add
    the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be
    his.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>16</verse><span>And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD some part of a field of his
    possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the seed thereof;
    a homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>17</verse><span>If he sanctify his field from the year of jubilee, according to thy
    estimation it shall stand.
    </span><verse>18</verse><span>But if he sanctify his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall
    reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain, even unto
    the year of the jubilee, and it shall be abated from thy estimation.
    </span><verse>19</verse><span>And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it, then he
    shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it
    shall be assured to him.
    </span><verse>20</verse><span>And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to
    another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.
    </span><verse>21</verse><span>But the field, when it goeth out in the jubilee, shall be holy unto the
    LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the
    priest’s.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>22</verse><span>And if a man sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath bought, which
    is not of the fields of his possession;
    </span><verse>23</verse><span>then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation, even
    unto the year of the jubilee; and he shall give thine estimation in that
    day, as a holy thing unto the LORD.
    </span><verse>24</verse><span>In the year of the jubilee the field shall return unto him of whom it
    was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land did
    belong.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>25</verse><span>And all thy estimation shall be according to the shekel of the
    sanctuary; twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>26</verse><span>Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD’s firstling,
    no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox, or sheep; it is the LORD’s.
    </span><verse>27</verse><span>And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it according to
    thine estimation, and shall add a fifth part of it thereto; or if it be
    not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy estimation.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>28</verse><span>Notwithstanding, no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto the
    LORD of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of the field of his
    possession, shall be sold or redeemed; every devoted thing is most holy
    unto the LORD.

    </span><verse>4</verse><span>For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve
    other gods; so will the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and

   <block>
    <verse>5</verse><span>But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their altars, and
    break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their

    </span><verse>6</verse><span>For thou art a holy people unto the LORD thy God; the LORD thy God hath

    bless the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn, and
    thy wine, and thine oil, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy
    sheep, in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee.
    </span><verse>14</verse><span>Thou shalt be blessed above all people; there shall not be male or

   <block>
    <verse>15</verse><span>And the LORD will take away from thee all sickness, and will put none
    of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, upon thee; but will
    lay them upon all them that hate thee.
    </span><verse>16</verse><span>And thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God shall
    deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them; neither shalt thou
    serve their gods; for that will be a snare unto thee.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>17</verse><span>If thou shalt say in thine heart, “These nations are more than I; how
    can I dispossess them?”
    </span><verse>18</verse><span>Thou shalt not be afraid of them; but shalt well remember what the LORD
    thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt;
    </span><verse>19</verse><span>the great temptations which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the
    wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched-out arm, whereby the

   <block>
    <verse>20</verse><span>Moreover the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them, until they

    </span><verse>21</verse><span>Thou shalt not be affrighted at them; for the LORD thy God is among
    you, a mighty God and terrible.
    </span><verse>22</verse><span>And the LORD thy God will put out those nations before thee by little
    and little; thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the
    field increase upon thee.
    </span><verse>23</verse><span>But the LORD thy God shall deliver them unto thee, and shall destroy
    them with a mighty destruction, until they be destroyed.
    </span><verse>24</verse><span>And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou shalt
    destroy their name from under heaven; there shall no man be able to
    stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them.
    </span><verse>25</verse><span>The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire; thou shalt not
    desire the silver or gold that in on them, nor take it unto thee, lest
    thou be snared therein; for it is an abomination to the LORD thy God.
    </span><verse>26</verse><span>Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house, lest thou be
    a cursed thing like it; but thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt
    utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing.</span></block>

    </span><verse>2</verse><span>And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee
    these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove thee,
    to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his
    commandments, or no.
    </span><verse>3</verse><span>And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to
    hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy
    fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread
    only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth

    of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills;
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>a land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and
    pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey;

    and dwelt therein;
    </span><verse>13</verse><span>and when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold
    is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied;

    brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage;
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness, wherein were
    fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where there was no water;
    who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint;
    </span><verse>16</verse><span>who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not,
    that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good
    at thy latter end;
    </span><verse>17</verse><span>and thou say in thine heart, “My power and the might of mine hand hath
    gotten me this wealth.”
    </span><verse>18</verse><span>But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God; for it is he that giveth thee
    power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he sware
    unto thy fathers, as it is this day.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>19</verse><span>And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD thy God, and walk

    <verse>7</verse><span>Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God to wrath
    in the wilderness; from the day that thou didst depart out of the land
    of Egypt, until ye came unto this place ye have been rebellious against
    the LORD.
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was angry
    with you to have destroyed you.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>9</verse><span>When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even
    the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I abode in
    the mount forty days and forty nights; I neither did eat bread nor drink
    water;
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>and the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the
    finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words which
    the LORD spake with you in the mount, out of the midst of the fire, in
    the day of the assembly.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>11</verse><span>And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that the
    LORD gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant.
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for
    thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted
    themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I
    commanded them; they have made them a molten image.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>13</verse><span>Furthermore the LORD spake unto me, saying, “I have seen this people,
    and, behold, it is a stiff-necked people.
    </span><verse>14</verse><span>Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from
    under heaven; and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than
    they.”</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>15</verse><span>So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with
    fire; and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.
    </span><verse>16</verse><span>And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your God, and
    had made you a molten calf; ye had turned aside quickly out of the way
    which the LORD had commanded you.
    </span><verse>17</verse><span>And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake
    them before your eyes.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>18</verse><span>And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty
    nights; I did neither eat bread nor drink water, because of all your
    sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD, to
    provoke him to anger.
    </span><verse>19</verse><span>For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the LORD
    was wroth against you to destroy you. But the LORD hearkened unto me at
    that time also.
    </span><verse>20</verse><span>And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him; and I
    prayed for Aaron also the same time.
    </span><verse>21</verse><span>And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with
    fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even until it was as
    small as dust; and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended
    out of the mount.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>22</verse><span>And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, ye provoked
    the LORD to wrath.
    </span><verse>23</verse><span>Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, “Go up and
    possess the land which I have given you;” then ye rebelled against the
    commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened
    to his voice.
    </span><verse>24</verse><span>Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew
    you.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>25</verse><span>Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as I fell
    down at the first; because the LORD had said he would destroy you.
    </span><verse>26</verse><span>I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy not thy
    people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth
    out of Egypt with a mighty hand.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>27</verse><span>Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the
    stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin;
    </span><verse>28</verse><span>lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the LORD was
    not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because
    he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.
    </span><verse>29</verse><span>Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest

   <block><span>Ye have seen all that the LORD did before your eyes in the land of Egypt
   unto Pharaoh, and unto all his servants, and unto all his land;

    Reubenites, and the Gadites, and to the half tribe of Manasseh.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>9</verse><span>Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that ye may

    </span><verse>10</verse><span>Ye stand this day all of you before the LORD your God; your captains of

    the gods of these nations; lest there should be among you a root that
    beareth gall and wormwood;
    </span><verse>19</verse><span>and it come to pass, when he heareth the words of this curse, that he
    bless himself in his heart, saying, “I shall have peace, though I walk

    after you, and the stranger that shall come from a far land, shall say,
    when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses which the
    LORD hath laid upon it;
    </span><verse>23</verse><span>and that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and burning,
    that it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass groweth therein, like
    the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboim, which the LORD
    overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath;
    </span><verse>24</verse><span>even all nations shall say, “Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto this land? What meaneth the
    heat of this great anger?”</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>25</verse><span>Then men shall say, “Because they have forsaken the covenant of the
    LORD God of their fathers which he made with them when he brought them
    forth out of the land of Egypt;
    </span><verse>26</verse><span>for they went and served other gods, and worshiped them, gods whom they
    knew not, and whom he had not given unto them;
    </span><verse>27</verse><span>and the anger of the LORD was kindled against this land, to bring upon
    it all the curses that are written in this book;

  the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho; and the LORD showed him
  all the land of Gilead, unto Dan,
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the
  land of Judah, unto the utmost sea,
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>and the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm
  trees, unto Zoar.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And the LORD said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   This is the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob,

  <verse>5</verse><span>So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab,

  </span><verse>6</verse><span>For the LORD took him unto his fathers, in a valley in the land of
  Moab, over against Beth-Peor; therefore no man knoweth of his sepulcher
  unto this day.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died; his eye was
  not dim, nor his natural force abated.

  <verse>1</verse><span>Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD, it came to pass,

   <block>
    <verse>2</verse><span>Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan,
    thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, even
    to the children of Israel.
    </span><verse>3</verse><span>Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I
    given unto you, as I said unto Moses.
    </span><verse>4</verse><span>From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the
    river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea
    toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast.
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of
    thy life; as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee; I will not fail
    thee, nor forsake thee.
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>Be strong and of a good courage; for unto this people shalt thou divide
    for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give
    them.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>7</verse><span>Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do
    according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee; turn
    not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest prosper
    whithersoever thou goest.
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt
    meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according
    to all that is written therein; for then thou shalt make thy way
    prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.
    </span><verse>9</verse><span>Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not

  <verse>12</verse><span>And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of

   land.”
   </span><verse>14</verse><span>Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land
   which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye shall pass before your
   brethren armed, all the mighty men of valor, and help them;
   </span><verse>15</verse><span>until the LORD have given your brethren rest, as he hath given you, and
   they also have possessed the land which the LORD your God giveth them;
   then ye shall return unto the land of your possession, and enjoy it,
   which Moses the LORD’s servant gave you on this side Jordan toward the
   sunrising.</span></quote>

  <verse>16</verse><span>And they answered Joshua, saying:</span><quote><span>
   All that thou commandest us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us,

   </span><verse>17</verse><span>According as we hearkened unto
   Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto thee; only the LORD thy God

  <verse>3</verse><span>And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of

  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise; all the people that
  came out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war, died in the
  wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>Now all the people that came out were circumcised; but all the people
  that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of
  Egypt, them they had not circumcised.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till
  all the people that were men of war, which came out of Egypt, were
  consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD; unto whom the
  LORD sware that he would not show them the land, which the LORD sware
  unto their fathers that he would give us, a land that floweth with milk
  and honey.

   Ye shall not shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any
   word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall
   ye shout.

  <verse>11</verse><span>So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about it once; and
  they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark
  of the LORD.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark
  of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the trumpets; and the
  armed men went before them; but the reward came after the ark of the
  LORD, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the
  camp. So they did six days.

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the
  dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven
  times; only on that day they compassed the city seven times.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And it came to pass the seventh time, when the priests blew with the
  trumpets, Joshua said unto the people:</span><quote><span>
   Shout; for the LORD hath given you the city.
   </span><verse>17</verse><span>And the city shall be accursed, even it, and
   all that are therein, to the LORD; only Rahab the harlot shall live, she
   and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers
   that we sent.
   </span><verse>18</verse><span>And ye, in any wise keep
   yourselves from the accursed thing, lest ye make yourselves accursed, when
   ye take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and
   trouble it.
   </span><verse>19</verse><span>But all the silver, and gold, and
   vessels of brass and iron, are consecrated unto the LORD; they shall come
   into the treasury of the LORD.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets; and it
  came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the
  people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that
  the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and
  they took the city.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>And they utterly destroyed all that was in the
  city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass,
  with the edge of the sword.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country,
  “Go into the harlot’s house, and bring out thence the woman, and all
  that she hath, as ye sware unto her.”
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and
  her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and
  they brought out all her kindred, and left them without the camp of
  Israel.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein; only the
  silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put
  into the treasury of the house of the LORD.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father’s household,
  and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel even unto this day;
  because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out
  Jericho.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>26</verse><span>And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying:</span><quote><span>
   Cursed be the man before the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city
   Jericho; he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his
   youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.

 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth-Aven, on
  the east side of Beth-El, and spake unto them, saying, “Go up and view

  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go
   up and smite Ai; and make not all the people to labor thither; for they
   are but few.
  </span></quote>

  <verse>4</verse><span>So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men; and
  they fled before the men of Ai.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men; for they
  chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim, and smote them in
  the going down; wherefore the hearts of the people melted, and became as
  water.

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before

  put dust upon their heads.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And Joshua said:</span><quote><span>
   Alas, O Lord GOD, wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over
   Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? Would
   to God we had been content, and dwelt on the other side Jordan!
   </span><verse>8</verse><span>O Lord, what shall I say, when Israel turneth
   their backs before their enemies!
   </span><verse>9</verse><span>For the

   <block><span>Get thee up; wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face?
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>Israel hath sinned, and they have also
    transgressed my covenant which I commanded them; for they have even taken
    of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they
    have put it even among their own stuff.
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>Therefore the children of Israel could not
    stand before their enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies,
    because they were

    <verse>13</verse><span>Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow;

    </span><verse>14</verse><span>In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes;
    and it shall be, that the tribe which the LORD taketh shall come
    according to the families thereof; and the family which the LORD shall

    take shall come man by man.
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>And it shall be, that he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be

  <verse>1</verse><span>And the LORD said unto Joshua:</span><quote><span>
   Fear not, neither be thou dismayed; take all the people of war with thee,
   and arise, go up to Ai; see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai,
   and his people, and his city, and his land;
   </span><verse>2</verse><span>and
   thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and her king;
   only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for a prey
   unto yourselves; lay thee an ambush for the city behind it.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai; and
  Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valor, and sent them away
  by night.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And he commanded them, saying:
  </span><quote><span>
   Behold, ye shall lie in wait against the city, even behind the city; go
   not very far from the city, but be ye all ready.
   </span><verse>5</verse><span>And I, and all the people that are with me, will
   approach unto the city; and it shall come to pass, when they come out
   against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them,
   </span><verse>6</verse><span>(for they will come out after us) till we have
   drawn them from the city; for they will say, “They flee before us, as at
   the first; therefore we will flee before them.”
   </span><verse>7</verse><span>Then ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize
   upon the city; for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand.
   </span><verse>8</verse><span>And it shall be, when ye have taken the city,

  <verse>9</verse><span>Joshua therefore sent them forth; and they went to lie in ambush; and

  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people, and
  went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And all the people, even the people of war that were with him, went up,
  and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the north side
  of Ai; now there was a valley between them and Ai.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush
  between Beth-El and Ai, on the west side of the city.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And when they had set the people, even all the host that was on the

  <verse>14</verse><span>And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted and
  rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to
  battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain;
  but he wist not that there were liers in ambush against him behind the
  city.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and

   Stretch out the spear that is in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it

  And Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the

  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And the ambush arose quickly out of their
  place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand; and they
  entered into the city, and took it, and hasted and set the city on fire.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they
  saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they
  had no power to flee this way or that way; and the people that fled to the

  midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side; and they
  smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the
  inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they chased
  them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they
  were consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto Ai, and smote it
  with the edge of the sword.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and women, were
  twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.

  Joshua burnt Ai, and made it a heap forever, even a desolation unto this

  <verse>9</verse><span>Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, and went up from Gilgal all
  night.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a great
  slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goeth up to
  Beth-Horon, and smote them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were in the
  going down to Beth-Horon, that the LORD cast down great stones from
  heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died; they were more which died
  with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the
  sword.

  <verse>12</verse><span>Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the

  <verse>16</verse><span>But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And it was told Joshua, saying, “The five kings are found hid in a cave
  at Makkedah.”
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>And Joshua said:</span><quote><span>
   Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave, and set men by it for to
   keep them;
   </span><verse>19</verse><span>and stay ye not, but pursue after
   your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter
   into their cities; for the LORD your God hath delivered them into your

  <verse>20</verse><span>And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an

  </span><verse>21</verse><span>And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace;
  none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>Then said Joshua, “Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five
  kings unto me out of the cave.”
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the
  cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth,
  the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto Joshua,
  that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the captains
  of the men of war which went with him, “Come near, put your feet upon
  the necks of these kings.” And they came near, and put their feet upon
  the necks of them.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>And Joshua said unto them, “Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and of
  good courage; for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies against
  whom ye fight.”

 <block>
  <verse>26</verse><span>And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five
  trees; and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that
  Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them
  into the cave wherein they had been hid, and laid great stones in the
  cave’s mouth, which remain until this very day.

  <verse>28</verse><span>And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of the

  Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho.

 <block>
  <verse>29</verse><span>Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto Libnah,

  thereof as he did unto the king of Jericho.

 <block>
  <verse>31</verse><span>And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto Lachish,

  </span><verse>33</verse><span>Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him

 <block>
  <verse>34</verse><span>And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel with him; and

 <block>
  <verse>36</verse><span>And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto Hebron;

  <verse>38</verse><span>And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and fought

  they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all
  the souls that were therein; he left none remaining; as he had done to
  Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king thereof; as he had done also
  to Libnah, and to her king.

 <block>
  <verse>40</verse><span>So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of

  Israel commanded.
  </span><verse>41</verse><span>And Joshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea even unto Gaza, and all the
  country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon.
  </span><verse>42</verse><span>And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, because
  the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel.

  <verse>1</verse><span>And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those things,
  that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to
  the king of Achshaph,
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>and to the kings that were on the north of the mountains, and of the
  plains south of Chinneroth, and in the valley, and in the borders of Dor
  on the west,
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>and to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and to the Amorite,
  and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in
  the mountains, and to the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And they went out, they and all their hosts with
  them, much people, even as the sand that is upon the seashore in
  multitude, with horses and chariots very many.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And when all these kings were met together, they
  came and pitched together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And the LORD said unto Joshua:</span><quote><span>
   Be not afraid because of them; for tomorrow about this time will I deliver
   them up all slain before Israel; thou shalt hough their horses, and burn
   their chariots with fire.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the
  waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote them,
  and chased them unto great Zidon, and unto Misrephoth- maim, and unto
  the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left them
  none remaining.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>And Joshua did unto them as the LORD bade him; he houghed their horses,
  and burnt their chariots with fire.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote the king
  thereof with the sword; for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those
  kingdoms.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the
  sword, utterly destroying them; there was not any left to breathe; and
  he burnt Hazor with fire.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did
  Joshua take, and smote them with the edge of the sword, and he utterly
  destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the LORD commanded.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>But as for the cities that stood still in their strength, Israel burned
  none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of
  Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they smote with
  the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they
  any to breathe.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>As the LORD commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua,
  and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that the LORD commanded
  Moses.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south country, and
  all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain, and the mountain
  of Israel, and the valley of the same;
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>even from the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto Baal-gad in
  the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon; and all their kings he took,
  and smote them, and slew them.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save
  the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon; all other they took in battle.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>For it was of the LORD to destroy them utterly, because they hardened
  their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle; that they
  might have no favor, that they might destroy them in battle, as the LORD
  commanded Moses.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakim from the
  mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the
  mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel; Joshua
  destroyed them utterly with their cities.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>There was none of the Anakim left in the land of the children of
  Israel; only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD said unto
  Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according to
  their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from war.

  <verse>24</verse><span>And Moses gave inheritance unto the tribe of Gad, even unto the

  </span><verse>2</verse><span>By lot was their inheritance, as the LORD commanded by the hand of
  Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half tribe.

  the other side Jordan; but unto the Levites he gave none inheritance
  among them.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim;
  therefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the land, save cities to

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And the lot of the children of Joseph fell from Jordan by Jericho, unto
  the water of Jericho on the east, to the wilderness that goeth up from
  Jericho throughout mount Beth- El,
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>and goeth out from Beth-El to Luz, and passeth along unto the borders
  of Archi to Ataroth,
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>and goeth down westward to the coast of Japhleti, unto the coast of
  Beth- Horon, the nether, and to Gezer; and the goings out thereof are at
  the sea.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>So the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their
  inheritance.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their families
  was thus; even the border of their inheritance on the east side was
  Ataroth-Addar, unto Beth-Horon the upper;
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>and the border went out toward the sea to Michmethah on the north side;
  and the border went about eastward unto Taanath-Shiloh, and passed by it
  on the east to Janohah;
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>and it went down from Janohah to Ataroth, and to Naarath, and came to
  Jericho, and went out at Jordan.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>The border went out from Tappuah westward unto the river Kanah; and the
  goings out thereof were at the sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe
  of the children of Ephraim by their families.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim were among the
  inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities with their
  villages.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>And they drave not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the
  Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites unto this day, and serve unto
  tribute.
 </span></block>

 <chapter>17
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the
  firstborn of Joseph; to wit, for Machir the first-born of Manasseh, the
  father of Gilead; because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead
  and Bashan.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>There was also a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh by their
  families; for the children of Abiezer, and for the children of Helek,
  and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem, and for
  the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida; these were the
  male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph by their families.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of
  Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters; and these are
  the names of his daughters, Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and
  Tirzah.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son
  of Nun, and before the princes, saying:</span><quote><span>
   The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  Therefore, according to the commandment of the LORD, he gave them an
  inheritance among the brethren of their father.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, besides
  the land of Gilead and Bashan, which were on the other side of Jordan;
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>because the daughters of Manasseh had an
  inheritance among his sons; and the rest of Manasseh’s sons had the land
  of Gilead.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>And the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that lieth
  before Shechem; and the border went along on the right hand unto the
  inhabitants of En-Tappuah.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>Now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah; but Tappuah on the border of
  Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim;
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>and the coast descended unto the river Kanah, southward of the river;
  these cities of Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh; the coast of
  Manasseh also was on the north side of the river, and the outgoings of
  it were at the sea;
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>southward it was Ephraim’s, and northward it was Manasseh’s, and the
  sea is his border; and they met together in Asher on the north, and in
  Issachar on the east.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Beth-Shean and her towns, and
  Ibleam and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, and the
  inhabitants of Endor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and
  her towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns, even three
  countries.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of
  those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxen strong,
  that they put the Canaanites to tribute; but did not utterly drive them
  out.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying:</span><quote><span>
   Why hast thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I am
   a great people, forasmuch as the LORD hath blessed me hitherto?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And Joshua answered them:</span><quote><span>
   If thou be a great people, then get thee up to the wood country, and cut
   down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the giants, if
   mount Ephraim be too narrow for thee.
  </span></quote>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>And the children of Joseph said:</span><quote><span>
   The hill is not enough for us; and all the Canaanites that dwell in the

   and her towns, and they who are of the valley of Jezreel.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and to
  Manasseh, saying: Thou art a great people, and hast great power; thou
  shalt not have one lot only;
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>but the mountain shall be thine; for it is a wood, and thou shalt cut
  it down; and the outgoings of it shall be thine; for thou shalt drive

  <verse>1</verse><span>And it came to pass, a long time after that the LORD had given rest

  and stricken in age.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And Joshua called for all Israel, and for their elders, and for their
  heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and said unto
  them:</span><quote>
   <block><span>I am old and stricken in age;
    </span><verse>3</verse><span>and ye have seen
    all that the LORD your God hath done unto all these nations because of
    you; for the LORD your God is he that hath fought for you.
    </span><verse>4</verse><span>Behold, I have divided unto you by lot these
    nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan,
    with all the nations that I have cut off, even unto the great sea
    westward.
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>And the LORD your God, he shall expel

    possess their land, as the LORD your God hath promised unto you.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>6</verse><span>Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written
    in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside therefrom to the
    right hand or to the left;
    </span><verse>7</verse><span>that ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you;
    neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by
    them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them;
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>but cleave unto the LORD your God, as ye have done unto this day.</span></block>

   <block>

    them, and go in unto them, and they to you;
    </span><verse>13</verse><span>know for a certainty that the LORD your God

 <chapter>24
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for
  the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for
  their officers; and they presented themselves before God.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And Joshua said unto all the people:</span><quote>
   <block><span>Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, your fathers dwelt on the other side of
   the flood in old time, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father
   of Nachor; and they served other gods.
    </span><verse>3</verse><span>And I
    took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood, and led him
    throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him
    Isaac.
    </span><verse>4</verse><span>And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau; and
    I gave unto Esau mount Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children
    went down into Egypt.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>5</verse><span>I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that
    which I did among them; and afterward I brought you out.
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>And I brought your fathers out of Egypt; and ye came unto the sea; and
    the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto
    the Red Sea.
    </span><verse>7</verse><span>And when they cried unto the LORD, he put darkness between you and the
    Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your
    eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt; and ye dwelt in the wilderness
    a long season.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>8</verse><span>And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt on the
    other side Jordan; and they fought with you; and I gave them into your
    hand, that ye might possess their land; and I destroyed them from before
    you.
    </span><verse>9</verse><span>Then Balak the son of Zipor, king of Moab, arose and warred against
    Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you;
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>but I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed you still; so
    I delivered you out of his hand.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>11</verse><span>And ye went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho; and the men of Jericho
    fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the
    Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the
    Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand.
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>And I sent the hornet before you, which drave them out from before you,
    even the two kings of the Amorites; but not with thy sword, nor with thy
    bow.
    </span><verse>13</verse><span>And I have given you a land for which ye did not labor, and cities
    which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the vineyards and
    olive-yards which ye planted not do ye eat.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>14</verse><span>Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in truth;
    and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the
    flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the LORD.
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day
    whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were
    on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose
    land ye dwell; but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.</span></block>

  </quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>And the people answered and said:</span><quote><span>
   God forbid that we should forsake the LORD, to serve other gods;
   </span><verse>17</verse><span>for the LORD our God, he it is that brought us
   up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage,
   and which did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the
   way wherein we went, and among all the people through whom we passed;
   </span><verse>18</verse><span>and the LORD drave out from before us all the
   people, even the Amorites which dwelt in the land; therefore will we also
   serve the LORD; for he is our God.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>And Joshua said unto the people:</span><quote><span>
   Ye cannot serve the LORD; for he is a holy God; he is a jealous God; he
   will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins.
   </span><verse>20</verse><span>If ye forsake the LORD, and serve strange gods,
   then he will turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath
   done you good.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>And the people said unto Joshua, “Nay; but we will serve the LORD.”
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>And Joshua said unto the people, “Ye are witnesses against yourselves
  that ye have chosen you the LORD, to serve him.” And they said, “We are
  witnesses.”
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>“Now therefore put away,” said he, “the strange gods which are among
  you, and incline your heart unto the LORD God of Israel.”
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>And the people said unto Joshua, “The LORD our God will we serve, and
  his voice will we obey.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>25</verse><span>So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a

  </span><verse>26</verse><span>And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a
  great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that was by the sanctuary

  </span><verse>27</verse><span>And Joshua said unto all the people:</span><quote><span>
   Behold, this stone shall be a witness unto us; for it hath heard all the

 <chapter>1

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of
  Israel asked the LORD, saying:</span><quote><span>
   Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against
   them?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>And the LORD said:</span><quote><span>
   Judah shall go up; behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>And Judah said unto Simeon his brother:</span><quote><span>
   Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and
   I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the
  Perizzites into their hand; and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand
  men.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And they found Adoni-Bezek in Bezek; and they fought against him, and
  they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>But Adoni-Bezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and
  cut off his thumbs and his great toes.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And Adoni-Bezek said, “Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs
  and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table; as I
  have done, so God hath requited me.” And they brought him to Jerusalem,
  and there he died.
 </span></block>

  <verse>8</verse><span>Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken
  it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the
  Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south, and in the
  valley.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron; now the

  Ahiman, and Talmai.

  <verse>11</verse><span>And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir; and the name
  of Debir before was Kirjath-Sepher;

  will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.”
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, took it; and he
  gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to ask of

  unto her, “What wilt thou?”
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>And she said unto him, “Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a

  </span><verse>34</verse><span>And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain; for they

  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And
  they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And the anger of the LORD was hot against

  </span><verse>15</verse><span>Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the

  <verse>16</verse><span>Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, which delivered them out of the

  </span><verse>18</verse><span>And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with the
  judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days

  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they returned, and
  corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in following other gods to

  </span><verse>8</verse><span>Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold

  children of Israel served Chushan-Rishathaim eight years.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised up

  the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And the
  Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to
  war; and the LORD delivered Chushan-Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD; and
  the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because
  they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and
  smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen
  years.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised
  them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man
  left-handed; and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon
  the king of Moab.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and
  he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab; and Eglon was a
  very fat man.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>And when he made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people
  that bare the present.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and
  said, “I have a secret errand unto thee, O king;” who said, “Keep
  silence.” And all that stood by him went out from him.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlor, which he
  had for himself alone; and Ehud said, “I have a message from God unto
  thee.” And he arose out of his seat.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right
  thigh, and thrust it into his belly;
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>and the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the
  blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the
  dirt came out.
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the
  parlor upon him, and locked them.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that,
  behold, the doors of the parlor were locked, they said, “Surely he
  covereth his feet in his summer chamber.”
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>And they tarried till they were ashamed; and, behold, he opened not the
  doors of the parlor; therefore they took a key, and opened them; and,
  behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>26</verse><span>And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries,
  and escaped unto Seirath.
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the
  mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from
  the mount, and he before them.
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>And he said unto them, “Follow after me; for the LORD hath delivered
  your enemies the Moabites into your hand.”
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab,
  and suffered not a man to pass over.
  </span><verse>29</verse><span>And they
  slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men
  of valor; and there escaped not a man.
  </span><verse>30</verse><span>So Moab

  <verse>1</verse><span>And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD,

  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that
  reigned in Hazor;
  the captain of whose host was Sisera, which dwelt in Harosheth of the
  Gentiles.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And the children of Israel cried unto
  the LORD; for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he
  mightily oppressed the children of Israel.

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at

  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah, between Ramah and Beth-El
  in mount Ephraim; and the children of Israel came up to her for
  judgment.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedeshnaphtali,
  and said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   Hath not the LORD God of Israel commanded, saying: Go and draw toward
   mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of
   Naphtali and the children of Zebulun?
   </span><verse>7</verse><span>And I will
   draw unto thee, to the river Kishon, Sisera the captain of Jabin’s army,
   with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into thine
   hand.
  </span></quote>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>And Barak said unto her:</span><quote><span>
   If thou wilt go with me, then I will go; but if thou wilt not go with me,

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>And she said:</span><quote><span>
   I will surely go with thee, notwithstanding the journey that thou takest

  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to
  Kedesh, and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet; and Deborah went
  up with him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the
  father-in-law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and
  pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>And they showed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to
  mount Tabor.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred
  chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth
  of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>And Deborah said unto Barak:</span><quote><span>
   Up; for this is the day in which the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thine

  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  So Barak, went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all his
  chariots, and all his hosts, with the edge of the sword before Barak, so
  that Sisera lighted down off his chariot, and fled away on his feet.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after
  the host, unto Harosheth of the Gentiles; and all the host of Sisera fell
  upon the edge of the sword; and there was not a man left.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of
  Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor
  and the house of Heber the Kenite.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, “Turn in, my lord,
  turn in to me; fear not.” And when he had turned in unto her into the
  tent, she covered him with a mantle.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And he said unto her, “Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink;
  for I am thirsty.” And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink;
  and covered him.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>Again he said unto her. “Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall
  be, when any man doth come and inquire of thee, and say, ‘Is there any
  man here?’ that thou shalt say, ‘No.’”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>Then Jael Heber’s wife took a nail of the tent, and took a hammer in
  her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the nail into his temples,
  and fastened it into the ground; for he was fast asleep, and weary. So
  he died.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and
  said unto him, “Come, and I will show thee the man whom thou seekest.” And when he came into her tent, behold, Sisera lay dead, and
  the nail was in his temples.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children
  of Israel.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>And

  the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.

  And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there

  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And the LORD said unto
  Gideon:
  </span><quote><span>
   The people are yet too many; bring them down unto the water, and I will
   try them for thee there; and it shall be, that of whom I say unto thee,
   “This shall go with thee,” the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever
   I say unto thee, “This shall not go with thee,” the same shall not go.

  <verse>5</verse><span>So he brought down the people unto the water; and the LORD said unto
  Gideon: Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog
  lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth
  down upon his knees to drink.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth,
  were three hundred men; but all the rest of the people bowed down upon
  their knees to drink water.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And the LORD said unto Gideon:</span><quote><span>
   By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the
   Midianites into thine hand; and let all the other people go every man unto
   his place.
  </span></quote>

  <verse>8</verse><span>So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets; and he
  sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent, and retained those
  three hundred men; and the host of Midian was beneath him in the
  valley.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered it into thine
   hand.
   </span><verse>10</verse><span>But if thou fear to go down, go thou with
   Phurah thy servant down to the host;
   </span><verse>11</verse><span>and thou
   shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened
   to go down unto the host.
  </span></quote>

 <block><span>
  Then went he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed
  men that were in the host.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And the Midianites
  and the Amalekites and all children of the east lay along in the valley
  like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as
  the sand by the seaside for multitude.

  <verse>13</verse><span>And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a dream

   Behold, I dreamed a dream, and lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the
   host of Midian, and came unto a tent, and smote it that it fell, and
   overturned it, that the tent lay along.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>And his fellow answered and said:</span><quote><span>
   This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the

   Arise; for the LORD hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian.
  </span></quote>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put a
  trumpet in every man’s hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the
  pitchers.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And he said unto them:</span><quote><span>
   Look on me, and do likewise; and, behold, when I come to the outside of
   the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall ye do.
   </span><verse>18</verse><span>When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are

  <verse>19</verse><span>So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the

  pitchers that were in their hands.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And the three companies blew the trumpets and brake the pitchers, and
  held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right

  </span><verse>21</verse><span>And they stood every man in his place round about the camp; and all the

  <verse>22</verse><span>And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every man’s

  </span><verse>23</verse><span>And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali, and
  out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after the Midianites.

  “Come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters unto

  <verse>1</verse><span>And the men of Ephraim said unto him, “Why hast thou served us thus,

  And they did chide with him sharply.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And he said unto them, “What have I done now in comparison of you? Is
  not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of
  Abiezer?
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and
  Zeeb; and what was I able to do in comparison of you?” Then their anger

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>And Gideon came to Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three hundred

  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And he said unto the men of Succoth, “Give, I pray you, loaves of bread
  unto the people that follow me; for they be faint, and I am pursuing

  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And the princes of Succoth said, “Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna
  now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thine army?”
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And Gideon said, “Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah and
  Zalmunna into mine hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of
  the wilderness and with briers.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>And he went up thence to Penuel, and spake unto them likewise; and the
  men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered him.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>And he spake also unto the men of Penuel, saying, “When I come again in
  peace, I will break down this tower.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about
  fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the hosts of the

  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east

  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, and took the
  two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the

 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun was up,

  he described unto him the princes of Succoth, and the elders thereof,
  even threescore and seventeen men.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said:</span><quote><span>
   Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, with whom ye did upbraid me, saying, “Are the

  <verse>16</verse><span>And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness, and

  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, “What manner of men were they
  whom ye slew at Tabor?” And they answered, “As thou art, so were they;
  each one resembled the children of a king.”
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And he said, “They were my brethren, even the sons of my mother; as the
  LORD liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you.”
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And he said unto Jether his firstborn, “Up, and slay them.”
 </span></block>

 <block><span>But the youth drew not his sword; for he feared, because he was yet a
 youth.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, “Rise thou, and
  fall upon us; for as the man is, so is his strength.” And Gideon arose,
  and slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that were on

  Gideon refuses to rule

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, “Rule thou over us, both thou,

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>And Gideon said unto them, “I would desire a

  (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>And they answered, “We will willingly give
  them.” And they spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the
  earrings of his prey.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>And the weight of the
  golden earrings that he requested was a thousand and
  </span><note>
   <superscript><span>a</span></superscript><span>43 lb or 20 kg</span></note><span>seven hundred shekels of gold; besides
   ornaments, and collars, and purple raiment that was on the kings of
   Midian, and besides the chains that were about their camels’ necks.
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in

  <verse>1</verse><span>Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor, and he was the

   Thou shalt not inherit in our father’s house; for thou art the son of a

  <verse>3</verse><span>Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob; and

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>And it came to pass in process of time, that the children of Ammon made
  war against Israel.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel,
  the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob;
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>and they said unto Jephthah:</span><quote><span>
   Come, and be our captain, that we may fight with the children of Ammon.

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him

  Egypt, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and unto Jordan; now therefore
  restore those lands again peaceably.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of
  Ammon;
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>and said unto him:</span><quote>
   <block><span>Thus saith Jephthah, Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land
   of the children of Ammon;
    </span><verse>16</verse><span>but when Israel came
    up from Egypt, and walked through the wilderness unto the Red Sea, and
    came to Kadesh;
    </span><verse>17</verse><span>then Israel sent messengers
    unto the king of Edom, saying, “Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy
    land; but the king of Edom would not hearken thereto.” And in like manner
    they sent unto the king of Moab; but he would not consent; and Israel
    abode in Kadesh.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>18</verse><span>Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the land of
    Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of
    Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, but came not within the
    border of Moab; for Arnon was the border of Moab.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>19</verse><span>And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of
    Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, “Let us pass, we pray thee, through
    thy land into my place.”
    </span><verse>20</verse><span>But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast; but Sihon
    gathered all his people together, and pitched in Jahaz, and fought
    against Israel.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>21</verse><span>And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the
    hand of Israel, and they smote them; so Israel possessed all the land of
    the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.
    </span><verse>22</verse><span>And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon even unto
    Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto Jordan.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>23</verse><span>So now the LORD God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites from
    before his people Israel, and shouldest thou possess it?
    </span><verse>24</verse><span>Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to
    possess? So whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out from before us,
    them will we possess.
    </span><verse>25</verse><span>And now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of
    Moab? Did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against
    them,
    </span><verse>26</verse><span>while Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and her
    towns, and in all the cities that be along by the coasts of Arnon, three
    hundred years? Why therefore did ye not recover them within that
    time?
    </span><verse>27</verse><span>Wherefore I have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong to
    war against me; the LORD the Judge be judge this day between the
    children of Israel and the children of Ammon.</span></block>

  </quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>28</verse><span>Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the words
  of Jephthah which he sent him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>29</verse><span>Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed over
  Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh
  of Gilead he passed over unto the children of Ammon.
  </span><verse>30</verse><span>And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said:</span><quote><span>
   If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into my hands,
   </span><verse>31</verse><span>then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth
   of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the
   children of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD’s, and I will offer it up for
   a burnt offering.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>32</verse><span>So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against
  them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands.
  </span><verse>33</verse><span>And he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith, even
  twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with a very great
  slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children
  of Israel.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>34</verse><span>And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and behold, his daughter
  came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances; and she was his only
  child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.
  </span><verse>35</verse><span>And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and
  said:</span><quote><span>
   Alas, my daughter! Thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them
   that trouble me; for I have opened my mouth unto the LORD, and I cannot go
   back.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>36</verse><span>And she said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth unto the LORD, do to me according
   to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath
   taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies, even of the children of Ammon.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>37</verse><span>And she said unto her father:</span><quote><span>
   Let this thing be done for me; let me alone two months, that I may go up

  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>38</verse><span>And he said, “Go.” And he sent her away for two months; and she went

  <verse>2</verse><span>And Jephthah said unto them:</span><quote><span>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with

  Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites, and among the
  Manassites.”
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites;

  me go over,” that the men of Gilead said unto him, “Art thou an
  Ephraimite?” If he said, “Nay;”
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>then said they unto him, “Say now Shibboleth;” and he said “Sibbolet;”

   Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not; but thou shalt conceive, and

  <verse>1</verse><span>And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the

  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, “I have
  seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines; now
  therefore get her for me to wife.”
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>Then his father and his mother said unto him, “Is there never a woman
  among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou
  goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines?” And Samson said
  unto his father, “Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well.”
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the LORD, that he
  sought an occasion against the Philistines; for at that time the
  Philistines had dominion over Israel.

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath, and
  came to the vineyards of Timnath; and, behold, a young lion roared
  against him.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he rent him as
  he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his hand; but he told
  not his father or his mother what he had done.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson
  well.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see
  the carcass of the lion; and, behold, there was a swarm of bees and
  honey in the carcass of the lion.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his
  father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat; but he told not
  them that he had taken the honey out of the carcass of the lion.

  <verse>10</verse><span>So his father went down unto the woman; and Samson made there a feast;

  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty
  companions to be with him.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And Samson said unto them:</span><quote><span>
   I will now put forth a riddle unto you; if ye can certainly declare it me
   within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you
   thirty sheets and thirty change of garments;
   </span><verse>13</verse><span>but if ye cannot declare it me, then shall ye
   give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments.

  not in three days expound the riddle.

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted; and
  it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she lay
  sore upon him; and she told the riddle to the children of her people.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun
  went down:</span><quote><span>
   What is sweeter than honey? And what is stronger than a lion?

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands,
  and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst between two
  tails.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the
  standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks, and also
  the standing corn, with the vineyards and olives.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>Then the Philistines said, “Who hath done this?” And they answered,
  “Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife,
  and given her to his companion.”
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And Samson said unto them, “Though ye have done
  this, yet will I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.”
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>And he smote them hip and thigh with a great
  slaughter; and he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam.

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread
  themselves in Lehi.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And
  the men of Judah said, “Why are ye come up against us?” And they answered,
  “To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he hath done to us.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam, and
  said to Samson, “Knowest thou not that the Philistines are rulers over
  us? What is this that thou hast done unto us?” And he said unto them,
  “As they did unto me, so have I done unto them.”
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And they said unto him, “We are come down to bind thee, that we may
  deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines.” And Samson said unto
  them, “Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.”
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And they spake unto him, saying, “No; but we will bind thee fast, and
  deliver thee into their hand; but surely we will not kill thee.”
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the rock.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And when he came into Lehi, the Philistines
  shouted against him; and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him,
  and the cords that were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with
  fire, and his bands loosed from off his hands.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put
  forth his hand, and took it, and slew a thousand men therewith.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And Samson said, “With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the
  jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast
  away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that place Ramathlehi.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>And he was sore athirst, and called on the LORD, and said:</span><quote><span>
   Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant; and
   now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?
  </span></quote>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>But God clave a hollow place that was in the jaw, and there came water

  this day.

  <verse>3</verse><span>And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the doors

  And he brake the withs, as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the

   Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth, that I

  of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and them which came out
  of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them.
  </span><verse>43</verse><span>Thus they inclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased them, and
  trode them down with ease over against Gibeah, toward the sun-rising.
  </span><verse>44</verse><span>And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were men of
  valor.
  </span><verse>45</verse><span>And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon;

  hard after them unto Gidom, and slew two thousand men of them.

  <verse>46</verse><span>So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five

  Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months.
  </span><verse>48</verse><span>And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin, and
  smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the men of every city, as
  the beast, and all that came to hand; also they set on fire all the

  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi:</span><quote><span>
   Let me now go to the field, and glean ears of corn after him in whose
   sight I shall find grace.

 <block><span>
  And she said unto her, “Go, my daughter.”

  <verse>3</verse><span>And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers; and
  her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was
  of the kindred of Elimelech.

   The LORD be with you.

  And they answered him, “The LORD bless thee.”

  <verse>6</verse><span>And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said:</span><quote><span>
   It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of

   and gather after the reapers among the sheaves;” so she came, and hath
   continued even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in
   the house.

  <verse>8</verse><span>Then said Boaz unto Ruth:</span><quote><span>
   Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither
   go from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens;
   </span><verse>9</verse><span>let thine eyes be on the field that they do
   reap, and go thou after them; have I not charged the young men that they
   shall not touch thee? And when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and
   drink of that which the young men have drawn.

  <verse>10</verse><span>Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>And Boaz answered and said unto her:</span><quote><span>
   It hath fully been showed me, all that thou hast done unto thy
   mother-in-law since the death of thine husband; and how thou hast left thy
   father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a
   people which thou knewest not heretofore.
   </span><verse>12</verse><span>The
   LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of the LORD God
   of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to trust.

  <verse>13</verse><span>Then she said:</span><quote><span>
   Let me find favor in thy sight, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me,

   not like unto one of thine handmaidens.

   At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in

  And she sat beside the reapers; and he reached her parched corn, and she
  did eat, and was sufficed, and left.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>And when
  she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying:
  </span><quote><span>
   Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not;
   </span><verse>16</verse><span>and let fall also some of the handfuls of
   purpose for her, and leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her
   not.

  <verse>1</verse><span>Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there; and, behold, the
  kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, “Ho, such a one!
  Turn aside, sit down here.” And he turned aside, and sat down.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, “Sit ye down
  here.” And they sat down.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And he said unto the kinsman:</span><quote><span>
   Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of
   land, which was our brother Elimelech’s;
   </span><verse>4</verse><span>and I
   thought to advertise thee, saying, “Buy it before the inhabitants, and
   before the elders of my people.” If thou wilt redeem it, redeem it; but if
   thou wilt not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know; for there is none
   to redeem it besides thee; and I am after thee.

 <block><span>
  And he said, “I will redeem it.”
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>Then said Boaz:
  </span><quote><span>
   What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy it also
   of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the
   dead upon his inheritance.

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And the kinsman said:</span><quote><span>
   I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance; redeem

  <verse>7</verse><span>Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming
  and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man plucked off
  his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor; and this was a testimony in
  Israel.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, “Buy it for thee.” So he drew off
  his shoe.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people:</span><quote><span>
   Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech’s,
   and all that was Chilion’s and Mahlon’s, of the hand of Naomi.
   </span><verse>10</verse><span>Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of
   Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead
   upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among
   his brethren, and from the gate of his place; ye are witnesses this day.

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said:</span><quote><span>
   We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come into thine house
   like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel; and do
   thou worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Bethlehem;
   </span><verse>12</verse><span>and let thy house be like the house of Pharez,

  <verse>13</verse><span>So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife; and when he went in unto her,

   Blessed be the LORD, which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman,
   that his name may be famous in Israel.
   </span><verse>15</verse><span>And he
   shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life, and a nourisher of thine old
