 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into
  Egypt; every man according to his household who came with Jacob.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy
  souls; for Joseph was in Egypt already.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and
  multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with
  them.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>And he said unto his people:</span><quote><span>
   Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than
   we.
   </span><verse>10</verse><span>Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest
   they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war,
   they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up
   out of the land.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their
  burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew.
  And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigor;
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in mortar, and in
  brick, and in all manner of service in the field; all their service,
  wherein they made them serve, was with rigor.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name
  of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah;
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>and he said:</span><quote><span>
   When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon
   the stools, if it be a son, then ye shall kill him; but if it be a
   daughter, then she shall live.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded
  them, but saved the men children alive.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto
  them:</span><quote><span>
   Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>And the midwives said unto Pharaoh:</span><quote><span>
   Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are
   lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>Therefore God dealt well with the midwives; and the people multiplied,
  and waxed very mighty.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them
  houses.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying:</span><quote><span>
   Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye
   shall save alive.

  The birth of Moses
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>2
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter
  of Levi.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And
  the woman conceived, and bare a son; and when she saw him that he was a
  goodly child, she hid him three months.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And when
  she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and
  daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she
  laid it in the flags by the river’s brink.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And
  his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river; and
  her maidens walked along by the river’s side; and when she saw the ark
  among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And when she had opened it, she saw the child; and, behold, the babe
  wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, “This is one of the
  Hebrews’ children.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>Then said his sister to Pharaoh’s daughter:</span><quote><span>
   Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may
   nurse the child for thee?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Go.” And the maid went and called
  the child’s mother.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>And Pharaoh’s daughter said unto her, “Take this child away, and nurse
  it for me, and I will give thee thy wages.” And the woman took the
  child, and nursed it.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh’s daughter, and he
  became her son.
  And she called his name Moses; and she said, “Because I drew him out of
  the water.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went
  out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens; and he spied an
  Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brethren.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no
  man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews
  strove together; and he said to him that did the wrong, “Wherefore
  smitest thou thy fellow?”
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And he said, “Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? Intendest
  thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian?” And Moses feared, and
  said, “Surely this thing is known.”
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>Now when Pharaoh heard this thing he sought to slay Moses. But Moses
  fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian; and he
  sat down by a well.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  Moses in Midian
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters; and they came and drew
  water, and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And the shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and
  helped them, and watered their flock.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, “How is it that ye
  are come so soon today?”
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And they said, “An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the
  shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock.”
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And he said unto his daughters, “And where is he? Why is it that ye
  have left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>And Moses was content to dwell with the man; and he gave Moses Zipporah
  his daughter.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom; for he said, “I
  have been a stranger in a strange land.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died;
  and the children of Israel sighted by reason of the bondage, and they
  cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with
  Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto
  them.

  The burning bush
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>3
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of
  Midian; and he led the flock to the back side of the desert, and came to
  the mountain of God even to Horeb.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>And again, the presence of the LORD appeared unto him, in a flame of
  fire in the midst of a bush; and he looked, and behold, the bush burned
  with fire, and the bush was not consumed.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And Moses said, “I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why
  the bush is not consumed.”
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And when the LORD saw that he
  turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and
  said, “Moses, Moses.” And he said, “Here am I.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>And he said:</span><quote><span>
   Draw not nigh hither; put off thy shoes from off thy feet; for the place
   whereon thou standest is holy ground.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>Moreover he said:</span><quote><span>
   I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the
   God of Jacob.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And the LORD said:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and
   have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their
   sorrows;
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>and I am come down to deliver them out
    of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a
    good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the
    place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the
    Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
    </span><verse>9</verse><span>Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children
    of Israel is come unto me; and I have also seen the oppression wherewith
    the Egyptians oppress them.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>10</verse><span>Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest
    bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.</span></block>

  </quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>And Moses said unto God:</span><quote><span>
   Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the
   children of Israel out of Egypt?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>And he said:</span><quote><span>
   Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a token unto thee, that I
   have sent thee; when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye
   shall serve God upon this mountain.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>And Moses said unto God:</span><quote><span>
   Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them,
   “The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you;” and they shall say to me,
   “What is his name?” what shall I say unto them?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>And God said unto Moses, “I AM THAT I AM.” And he said:</span><quote><span>
   Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, “I AM hath sent me unto
   you.”
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And God said moreover unto Moses:</span><quote>
   <block><span>Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, “The LORD God of your
   fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath
   sent me unto you. This is my name forever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.”</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>16</verse><span>Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, “The
    LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob,
    appeared unto me, saying, ‘I have surely visited you, and seen that
    which is done to you in Egypt;
    </span><verse>17</verse><span>and I have said I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto
    the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the
    Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with
    milk and honey.’”</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>18</verse><span>And they shall hearken to thy voice; and thou shalt come, thou and the
    elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him,
    “The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us; and now let us go, we
    beseech thee, three days’ journey into the wilderness, that we may
    sacrifice to the LORD our God.”</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>19</verse><span>And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a
    mighty hand.
    </span><verse>20</verse><span>And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders
    which I will do in the midst thereof; and after that he will let you go.
    </span><verse>21</verse><span>And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians; and it
    shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty;
    </span><verse>22</verse><span>but every woman shall borrow of her neighbor, and of her that
    sojourneth in her house; jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and
    raiment; and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters;
    and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.</span></block>

  Signs for Moses
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>4
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And Moses answered and said:</span><quote><span>
   But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice; for they
   will say, The LORD hath not appeared unto thee.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>And the LORD said unto him, “What is that in thine hand?” And he said,
  “A rod.”
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And he said, “Cast it on the ground.” And he cast it on the ground, and it
  became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And the LORD said unto Moses, “Put forth thine
  hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it,
  and it became a rod in his hand.
  </span><quote>
   <verse>5</verse><span>That they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the God of
   Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto
   thee.</span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And the LORD said furthermore unto him, “Put now thine hand into thy
  bosom.” And he put his hand into his bosom; and when he took it out,
  behold, his hand was leprous as snow.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And he said, “Put thy hand into thy bosom again.” And he put his hand
  into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it
  was turned again as his other flesh.</span><quote>
   <verse>8</verse><span>And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither
   hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice
   of the latter sign.
   </span><verse>9</verse><span>And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two
   signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water
   of the river, and pour it upon the dry land; and the water which thou
   takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.</span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>And Moses said unto the LORD:</span><quote><span>
   O my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast
   spoken unto thy servant; but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>And the LORD said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   Who hath made man’s mouth? Or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing,
   or the blind? Have not I the LORD?
   </span><verse>12</verse><span>Now
   therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt
   say.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>And he said:</span><quote><span>
   O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>
    Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And
    also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee; and when he seeth thee, he
    will be glad in his heart.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>15</verse><span>And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth; and I will
    be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall
    do.
    </span><verse>16</verse><span>And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people; and he shall be, even he
    shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of
    God.
    </span><verse>17</verse><span>And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do
    signs.</span></block>

  Moses returns to Egypt
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said unto
  him, “Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which are in
  Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive.” And Jethro said to Moses, “Go
  in peace.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, “Go, return into Egypt; for all
  the men are dead which sought thy life.”
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he
  returned to the land of Egypt; and Moses took the rod of God in his
  hand.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>And the LORD said unto Moses:</span><quote><span>When thou goest to return into Egypt, see that thou do all those
  wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in thine hand, and I will
   </span><dunder><span>prosper thee; but Pharaoh wil</span></dunder><span>l harden his heart, and he will not
   let the people go.
   </span><verse>22</verse><span>And thou shalt say unto
   Pharaoh, “Thus saith the LORD: Israel is my son, even my firstborn;
   </span><verse>23</verse><span>and I say unto thee, let my son go, that he may
   serve me; and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son,
   even thy firstborn.”
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>And it came to pass, that the LORD appeared
  unto him as he was in the way, by the inn.
  </span><dunder><span>The Lord was angry with Mose</span></dunder><span>s, and his hand was about to fall upon
  him to kill him;
  </span><dunder><span>for he had not circumcised his son</span></dunder><span>.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>Then Zipporah took a sharp stone and
  circumcised her son, and cast the stone at his feet, and said, “Surely
  thou art a bloody husband unto me.”
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>And the
  LORD spared Moses and let him go, because Zipporah, his wife, circumcised
  the child. And she said, “Thou art a bloody husband.”
  </span><dunder><span>And Moses was ashamed, and hid his face from the Lord, and said, “I have sinned before the Lord.”</span></dunder>

 <block>
  <verse>27</verse><span>And the LORD said unto Aaron, “Go into the
  wilderness to meet Moses.” And he went and met him, in the mount of God;
  </span><dunder><span>in the mount where God appeared unto him</span></dunder><span>; and Aaron kissed him.
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD
  who had sent him, and all the signs which he had commanded him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>29</verse><span>And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the
  children of Israel;

  did the signs in the sight of the people.
  </span><verse>31</verse><span>And the people believed; and when they heard that the LORD had visited
  the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their affliction,
  then they bowed their heads and worshiped.

  <verse>1</verse><span>And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh:</span><quote><span>
   Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, “Let my people go, that they may hold a

  </span></quote>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>And Pharaoh said:</span><quote><span>

  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>And they said:</span><quote><span>
   The God of the Hebrews hath met with us; let us go, we pray thee, three

   he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>And the king of Egypt said unto them:</span><quote><span>
   Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, lead the people from their works? Get

  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>And Pharaoh said:</span><quote><span>
   Behold, the people of the land now are many, and ye make them rest from
   their burdens.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and
  their officers, saying,</span><quote>
   <verse>7</verse><span>Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore;
   let them go and gather straw for themselves.
   </span><verse>8</verse><span>And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall
   lay upon them; ye shall not diminish aught thereof; for they be idle;
   therefore they cry, saying, “Let us go and sacrifice to our God.”
   </span><verse>9</verse><span>Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labor therein;
   and let them not regard vain words.</span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and
  they spake to the people, saying:</span><quote><span>
   Thus saith Pharaoh, “I will not give you straw.”
   </span><verse>11</verse><span>Go ye, get your straw where ye can find it; yet
   not aught of your work shall be diminished.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to
  gather stubble instead of straw.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, “Fulfill your works, your
  daily tasks, as when there was straw.”
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh’s taskmasters
  had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, “Wherefore have ye not
  fulfilled your task in making brick, both yesterday and today, as
  heretofore?”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto
  Pharaoh, saying:
  </span><quote><span>Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?
   </span><verse>16</verse><span>There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, “Make
   brick;” and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault is in thine
   own people.</span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>But he said:</span><quote><span>
   Ye are idle, ye are idle; therefore ye say, “Let us go and do sacrifice to
   the LORD.”
   </span><verse>18</verse><span>Go therefore now, and work; for
   there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of
   bricks.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in
  evil case, after it was said, “Ye shall not diminish aught from your
  bricks of your daily task.”
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth
  from Pharaoh;
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>and they said unto them:</span><quote><span>
   The LORD look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savor to be
   abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a
   sword in their hand to slay us.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said:</span><quote><span>
   Lord, wherefore hast thou so evil entreated this people? Why is it that
   thou hast sent me?
   </span><verse>23</verse><span>For since I came to Pharaoh
   to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou
   delivered thy people at all.

  <verse>1</verse><span>In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of
  the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert of
  Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped before
  the mount.

    Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of
    Israel;
    </span><verse>4</verse><span>ye have seen what I did unto the

   ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it; whosoever toucheth
   the mount shall be surely put to death;

  the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses went up.

   Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto the LORD to gaze,

  become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against thee.
