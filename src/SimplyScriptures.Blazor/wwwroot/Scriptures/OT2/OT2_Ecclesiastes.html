 <block><verse>1</verse><span>The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  All is vanity
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is
  vanity.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>What profit hath a man of all his labor which he taketh under the sun?
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh; but the
  earth abideth forever.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place
  where he arose.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it
  whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to
  his circuits.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea in not full; unto the
  place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>All things are full of labor; man cannot utter it; the eye is not
  satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is
  done is that which shall be done; and there is no new thing under the
  sun.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>Is there anything whereof it may be said, “See, this is new”? It hath
  been already of old time, which was before us.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any
  remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come
  after.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  The vanity of wisdom
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all
  things that are done under heaven; this sore travail hath God given to
  the sons of man to be exercised therewith.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all
  is vanity and vexation of spirit.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>That which is crooked cannot be made straight; and that which is
  wanting cannot be numbered.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>I communed with mine own heart, saying, “Lo, I am come to great estate,
  and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in
  Jerusalem; yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.”
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly; I
  perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>For in much wisdom is much grief; and he that increaseth knowledge
  increaseth sorrow.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  The vanity of self-indulgence
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>2
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>I said in mine heart, “Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth;
  therefore enjoy pleasure;” and, behold, this also is vanity.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>I said of laughter, “It is mad;” and of mirth, “What doeth it?”
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine
  heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was
  that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all
  the days of their life.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards;
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kind
  of fruits;
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth
  forth trees;
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also
  I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in
  Jerusalem before me;
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings
  and of the provinces; I gat me men singers and women singers, and the
  delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments, and that of all
  sorts.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in
  Jerusalem; also my wisdom remained with me.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not
  my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labor; and this
  was my portion of all my labor.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought,
  and on the labor that I had labored to do; and, behold, all was vanity and
  vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  The vanity of trying to live wisely
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly; for what
  can the man do that cometh after the king? Even that which hath been
  already done.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth
  darkness.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>The wise man’s eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness;
  and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>Then said I in my heart, “As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth
  even to me;” and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart that
  this also is vanity.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool forever;
  seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And
  how dieth the wise man? As the fool.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun
  is grievous unto me; for all is vanity and vexation of spirit.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  The vanity of labor
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>Yea, I hated all my labor which I had taken under the sun, because I
  should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? Yet shall he
  have rule over all my labor wherein I have labored, and wherein I have
  showed myself wise under the sun. This is also vanity.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labor
  which I took under the sun.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>For there is a man whose labor is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in
  equity; yet to a man that hath not labored therein shall he leave it for
  his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>For what hath man of all his labor, and of the vexation of his heart,
  wherein he hath labored under the sun?
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart
  taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink,
  and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labor. This also I
  saw, that it was from the hand of God.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I?
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight, wisdom, and
  knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and
  to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God. This also
  is vanity and vexation of spirit.

  <verse>1</verse><span>To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under
  heaven:

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboreth?
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men to be
  exercised in it.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>He hath made everything beautiful in his time; also he hath set the
  world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God
  maketh from the beginning to the end.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice, and
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all
  his labor, it is the gift of God.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be forever; nothing can be
  put to it, nor anything taken from it; and God doeth it, that men should
  fear before him.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been,
  and God requireth that which is past.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  All turn to dust again
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that wickedness
  was there; and the place of righteousness, that iniquity was there.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>I said in mine heart, “God shall judge the righteous and the wicked;”
  for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>I said in mine heart concerning the estates of the sons of men, that
  God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves
  are beasts.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one
  thing befalleth them; as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they
  have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast;
  for all is vanity.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the
  beast that goeth downward to the earth?
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man
  should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion; for who shall
  bring him to see what shall be after him?

  The evil under the sun
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>4
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under
  the sun; and behold the tears of such as where oppressed, and they had
  no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but
  they had no comforter.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead, more than the
  living, which are yet alive.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>Yea, better is he than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not
  seen the evil work that is done under the sun.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a
  man is envied of his neighbor. This is also vanity and vexation of
  spirit.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>Better is a handful with quietness, than both the hands full with
  travail and vexation of spirit.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath neither
  child nor brother; yet is there no end of all his labor; neither is his
  eye satisfied with riches; neither saith he, “For whom do I labor, and
  bereave my soul of good?” This is also vanity, yea, it is a sore
  travail.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their
  labor.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him that
  is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>Again, if two lie together, then they have heat; but how can one be
  warm alone?
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And if one prevail against him two shall withstand him; and a threefold
  cord is not quickly broken.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>Better is a poor and a wise child, than an old and foolish king, who
  will no more be admonished.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is born in
  his kingdom becometh poor.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>I considered all the living which walk under
  the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>There is no end of all the people, even of all
  that have been before them; they also that come after shall not rejoice in
  him. Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit.
 </span></block>

 <chapter>5
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to
  hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools; for they consider not that
  they do evil.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter
  anything before God; for God is in heaven, and thou upon earth;
  therefore let thy words be few.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool’s
  voice is known by multitude of words.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath no
  pleasure in fools; pay that which thou hast vowed.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow
  and not pay.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before
  the angel, that it was an error; wherefore should God be angry at thy
  voice, and destroy the work of thine hands?
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>For in the multitude of dreams and many words there are also divers
  vanities; but fear thou God.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  The vanity of wealth and honor
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of
  judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter; for he
  that is higher than the highest regardeth; and there be higher than
  they.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>Moreover the profit of the earth is for all; the king himself is served
  by the field.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that
  loveth abundance with increase; this is also vanity.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>When goods increase, they are increased that eat them; and what good is
  there to the owners thereof, saving the beholding of them with their
  eyes?
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>The sleep of a laboring man is sweet, whether he eat little or much;
  but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely, riches
  kept for the owners thereof to their hurt.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>But those riches perish by evil travail; and he begetteth a son, and
  there is nothing in his hand.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>As he came forth of his mother’s womb, naked shall he return to go as
  he came, and shall take nothing of his labor, which he may carry away in
  his hand.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And this also is a sore evil, that in all points as he came, so shall
  he go; and what profit hath he that hath labored for the wind?
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>All his days also he eateth in darkness, and he hath much sorrow and
  wrath with his sickness.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>Behold that which I have seen; it is good and comely for one to eat and
  to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labor that he taketh under
  the sun all the days of his life, which God giveth him; for it is his
  portion.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given
  him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his
  labor; this is the gift of God.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God
  answereth him in the joy of his heart.
 </span></block>

 <chapter>6
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is common
  among men;
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>a man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honor, so that he
  wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet God giveth him
  not power to eat thereof, but a stranger eateth it; this is vanity, and
  it is an evil disease.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>If a man beget a hundred children, and live many years, so that the
  days of his years be many, and his soul be not filled with good, and
  also that he have no burial; I say, that an untimely birth is better
  than he.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>For he cometh in with vanity, and departeth in darkness, and his name
  shall be covered with darkness.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>Moreover he hath not seen the sun, nor known anything; this hath more
  rest than the other.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>Yea, though he
  live a thousand years twice told, yet hath he seen no good; do not all go
  to one place?
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>All the labor of man is for his
  mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>For what hath the wise more than the fool? What hath the poor, that
  knoweth to walk before the living?
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire; this
  is also vanity and vexation of spirit.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>That which hath been is named already, and it is known that it is man;
  neither may he contend with him that is mightier than he.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>Seeing there be many things that increase vanity, what is man the
  better?
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>For who knoweth what is good for man in this life, all the days of his
  vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? For who can tell a man what
  shall be after him under the sun?
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  The contrast of wisdom and folly
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>7
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>A good name is better than precious ointment; and the day of death than
  the day of one’s birth.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of
  feasting; for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to
  his heart.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>Sorrow is better than laughter; for by the sadness of the countenance
  the heart is made better.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of
  fools is in the house of mirth.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the
  song of fools;
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>for as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the
  fool; this also is vanity.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the
  heart.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof; and the
  patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry; for anger resteth in the bosom
  of fools.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>Say not thou, “What is the cause that the former days were better than
  these?” For thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>Wisdom is good with an inheritance; and by it there is profit to them
  that see the sun.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>For wisdom is a defense, and money is a defense; but the excellency of
  knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them that have it.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>Consider the work of God; for who can make that straight, which he hath
  made crooked?
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity
  consider; God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end
  that man should find nothing after him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>All things have I seen in the days of my vanity; there is a just man
  that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that
  prolongeth his life in his wickedness.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>Be not righteous overmuch, neither make thyself overwise; why shouldest
  thou destroy thyself?
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>Be not overmuch wicked, neither be thou foolish; why shouldest thou die
  before thy time?
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this
  withdraw not thine hand; for he that feareth God shall come forth of
  them all.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which are in the
  city.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth
  not.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy
  servant curse thee;
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>for oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise
  hast cursed others.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>All this have I proved by wisdom; I said, “I will be wise;” but it was
  far from me.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>That
  which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>25</verse><span>I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom,
  and the reason of things, and to know the wickedness of folly, even of
  foolishness and madness;
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>and I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart is snares and
  nets, and her hands as bands; whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken
  by her.
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>Behold, this have I found, saith the
  Preacher, counting one by one, to find out the account;
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not; one
  man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not
  found.
  </span><verse>29</verse><span>Lo, this only have I found, that God
  hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.

  Keep the king’s commandment
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>8
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Who is as the wise man? And who knoweth the interpretation of a thing?
  A man’s wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face
  shall be changed.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>I counsel thee to keep the king’s commandment, and that in regard of
  the oath of God.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>Be not hasty to go out of his sight; stand not in an evil thing; for he
  doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>Where the word of a king is, there is power; and who may say unto him,
  “What doest thou?”
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>Whoso keeps the commandment shall feel no evil thing; and a wise man’s
  heart discerneth both time and judgment.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the
  misery of man is great upon him.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>For he knoweth not that which shall be; for who can tell him when it
  shall be?
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit;
  neither hath he power in the day of death; and there is no discharge in
  that war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done
  under the sun; there is a time wherein one man ruleth over another to
  his own hurt.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of
  the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done;
  this is also vanity.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily,
  therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>Though a sinner do evil a hundred times, and his days be prolonged, yet
  surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear
  before him;
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>but it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his
  days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth not before God.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just men,
  unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there
  be wicked men, to whom it happeneth according to the work of the
  righteous; I said that this also is vanity.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the
  sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry; for that shall abide
  with him of his labor the days of his life, which God giveth him under
  the sun.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that
  is done upon the earth; (for also there is that neither day nor night
  seeth sleep with his eyes)
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work
  that is done under the sun; because though a man labor to seek it out,
  yet he shall not find it; yea further; though a wise man think to know
  it, yet shall he not be able to find it.

 <chapter>9
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this, that
  the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God; no
  man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before them.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>All things come alike to all; there is one event to the righteous, and
  to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him
  that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not; as is the good, so is
  the sinner; and he that sweareth, as he that feareth an oath.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun, that
  there is one event unto all; yea, also the heart of the sons of men is
  full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after
  that they go to the dead.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope; for a living dog is
  better than a dead lion.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>For the living know that they shall die; but
  the dead know not anything, neither have they anymore a reward; for the
  memory of them is forgotten.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>Also their love,
  and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they
  anymore a portion forever in anything that is done under the sun.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry
  heart; for God now accepteth thy works.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no
  ointment.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life
  of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all the days of
  thy vanity; for that is thy portion in this life, and in thy labor which
  thou takest under the sun.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is
  no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither
  thou goest.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift,
  nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet
  riches to men of understanding, nor yet favor to men of skill; but time
  and chance happeneth to them all.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>For man also knoweth not his time; as the fishes that are taken in an
  evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so are the sons
  of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it seemed great unto
  me;
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>there was a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great
  king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom
  delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>Then said I, “Wisdom is better than strength; nevertheless the poor
  man’s wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him that
  ruleth among fools.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>Wisdom is better than weapons of war; but one sinner destroyeth much
  good.

  <verse>1</verse><span>Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a
  stinking savor; so doth a little folly him that is in reputation for
  wisdom and honor.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>A wise man’s heart is at his right hand; but a fool’s heart at his
  left.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth
  him, and he saith to everyone that he is a fool.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place;
  for yielding pacifieth great offenses.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as an error which
  proceedeth from the ruler;
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon
  the earth.

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh a hedge, a
  serpent shall bite him.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that cleaveth
  wood shall be endangered thereby.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to
  more strength; but wisdom is profitable to direct.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no
  better.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>The words of a wise man’s mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool
  will swallow up himself.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness; and the end of
  his talk is mischievous madness.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>A fool also is full of words; a man cannot tell what shall be; and what
  shall be after him, who can tell him?
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>The labor of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth
  not how to go to the city.

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>Woe to the, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes eat in
  the morning!
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles, and thy
  princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>By much slothfulness the building decayeth;
  and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh
  merry; but money answereth all things.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>Curse
  not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy
  bedchamber; for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which
  hath wings shall tell the matter.‌

  <verse>1</verse><span>Cast thy bread upon the waters; for thou shalt find it after many days.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not what
  evil shall be upon the earth.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth;
  and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place
  where the tree falleth, there it shall be.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the
  clouds shall not reap.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>As thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit, nor how the bones do
  grow in the womb of her that is with child; even so thou knowest not the
  works of God who maketh all.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine
  hand; for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that,
  or whether they both shall be alike good.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to
  behold the sun;
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>but if a man live many years, and rejoice in them all; yet let him
  remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All that cometh
  is vanity.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the
  days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight
  of thine eyes; but know thou, that for all these things God will bring
  thee into judgment.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy
  flesh; for childhood and youth are vanity.

 <chapter>12
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days
  come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no
  pleasure in them;
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>while the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not
  darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain;
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong
  men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few,
  and those that look out of the windows be darkened.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the
  grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all
  the daughters of music shall be brought low;
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall
  be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper
  shall be a burden, and desire shall fail; because man goeth to his long
  home, and the mourners go about the streets;
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the
  pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was; and the spirit shall
  return unto God who gave it.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher; all is vanity.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>And moreover, because the Preacher was wise, he still taught the people
  knowledge; yea, he gave good heed, and sought out, and set in order many
  proverbs.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>The Preacher sought to find out acceptable words; and that which was
  written was upright, even words of truth.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails fastened by the
  masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And further, by these, my son, be admonished; of making many books
  there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter. Fear God, and keep his
  commandments; for this is the whole duty of man.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing,
  whether it be good, or whether it be evil.
