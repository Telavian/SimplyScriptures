    Solomon asks for wisdom

   <block>
    <verse>1</verse><span>And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the
    LORD his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>2</verse><span>Then Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of
    hundreds, and to the judges, and to every governor in all Israel, the
    chief of the fathers.
    </span><verse>3</verse><span>So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place
    that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of
    God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness.
    </span><verse>4</verse><span>But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjath-Jearim to the
    place which David had prepared for it; for he had pitched a tent for it
    at Jerusalem.
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>Moreover the brazen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of
    Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the LORD; and Solomon and
    the congregation sought unto it.
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>And Solomon went up thither to the brazen altar before the LORD, which
    was at the tabernacle of the congregation, and offered a thousand burnt
    offerings upon it.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>7</verse><span>In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, “Ask what
    I shall give thee.”
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>8</verse><span>And Solomon said unto God:
    </span><quote>
     <block><span>
      Thou hast showed great mercy unto David my father, and hast made me to
      reign in his stead.
      </span><verse>9</verse><span>Now, O LORD God, let thy
      promise unto David my father be established; for thou hast made me king
      over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.
      </span><verse>10</verse><span>Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before
      this people; for who can judge this thy people, that is so great?</span></block>

    </quote>
   </block>

   <block>
    <verse>11</verse><span>And God said to Solomon:</span><quote><span>
     Because this was in thine heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth,
     or honor, nor the life of thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life;
     but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my
     people, over whom I have made thee king;
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and
     I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honor such as none of the kings
     have had that have been before thee, neither shall there any after thee
     have the like.
    </span></quote>

   <block>
    <verse>13</verse><span>Then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at Gibeon
    to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of the congregation, and
    reigned over Israel.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>14</verse><span>And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen;
    and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand
    horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at
    Jerusalem.
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>And the king made silver and gold
    at Jerusalem as plenteous as stones, and cedar trees made he as the
    sycamore trees that are in the vale for abundance.
    </span><verse>16</verse><span>And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt,
    and linen yarn; the king’s merchants received the linen yarn at a price.
    </span><verse>17</verse><span>And they fetched up, and brought forth out of
    Egypt a chariot for

     the kings of Syria, by their means.

    <verse>1</verse><span>And Solomon determined to build a house for the name of the LORD, and a
    house for his kingdom.
    </span><verse>2</verse><span>And Solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear
    burdens,
    and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain, and three thousand and six
    hundred to oversee them.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>3</verse><span>And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying:
    </span><quote>
     <block><span>
      As thou didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to
      build him a house to dwell therein, therefore, even so deal with me.
      </span><verse>4</verse><span>Behold, I build a house to the name of the LORD
      my God, to dedicate it to him, and to burn before him sweet incense, and
      for the continual showbread, and for the burnt offerings morning and
      evening, on the Sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts
      of the LORD our God. And this ordinance shall be kept in Israel forever.
     </span></block>

     <block>
      <verse>5</verse><span>And the house which I build shall be a great house; for great is the
      LORD our God above all gods.
      </span><verse>6</verse><span>But who is able to build him a house, seeing the heaven and heaven of
      heavens cannot contain him? Who am I then, that I should build him a
      house, save only to burn sacrifice before him?</span></block>

     <block>
      <verse>7</verse><span>Send me now therefore a man cunning to work in
      gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and
      crimson, and blue, and that has skill to grave with the cunning men that
      are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father did provide.
      </span><verse>8</verse><span>Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum
      trees, out of Lebanon; for I know that thy servants have skill to cut
      timber in Lebanon; and, behold, I will send my servants with thy servants,
      </span><verse>9</verse><span>even to prepare me timber in abundance; for the
      house which I am about to build shall be wonderful great.
      </span><verse>10</verse><span>And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the

    <verse>11</verse><span>Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to

      Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who hath
      given to David the king a wise son, endued with prudence and

      kingdom.
     </span></block>

     <block>
      <verse>13</verse><span>And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with understanding, of Huram
      my father’s,
      </span><verse>14</verse><span>the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of
      Tyre, skillful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in
      stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in
      crimson; also to grave any manner of graving, and to find out every
      device which shall be put to him, with thy cunning men, and with the
      cunning men of my lord David thy father.</span></block>

     <block>
      <verse>15</verse><span>Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine, which
      my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his servants:
      </span><verse>16</verse><span>and we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need; and we

    hundred.

    <verse>1</verse><span>Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem in mount

    David had prepared in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.

    <verse>5</verse><span>And the greater house he ceiled with fir tree, which he overlaid with
    fine gold, and set thereon palm trees and chains.
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty; and the
    gold was gold of Parvaim.
    </span><verse>7</verse><span>He overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the walls
    thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved cherubim on the
    walls.

   <block>
    <verse>8</verse><span>And he made the most holy house, the length whereof was according to the

    <verse>10</verse><span>And in the most holy house he made two

    was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was
    five cubits also, joining to the wing of the other cherub.
    </span><verse>13</verse><span>The wings of these cherubim spread themselves

    </span><verse>16</verse><span>And he made chains, as in the oracle, and put
    them on the heads of the pillars; and made a hundred pomegranates, and put
    them on the chains.
    </span><verse>17</verse><span>And he reared up the
    pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the
    left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name

    <verse>6</verse><span>He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on

    offering they washed in them; but the sea was for the priests to wash
    in.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>7</verse><span>And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form, and set
    them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.

   <block>
    <verse>8</verse><span>He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the

   <block>
    <verse>9</verse><span>Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and
    doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass.

   <block>
    <verse>11</verse><span>And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basins. And Huram
    finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the house of
    God;

    on the top of the two pillars, and the two wreaths to cover the two
    pommels of the chapiters which were on the top of the pillars;
    </span><verse>13</verse><span>and four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths; two rows of
    pomegranates on each wreath, to cover the two pommels of the chapiters
    which were upon the pillars.
    </span><verse>14</verse><span>He made also bases, and lavers made he upon the bases;
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>one sea, and twelve oxen under it.
    </span><verse>16</verse><span>The pots also, and the shovels, and the fleshhooks, and all their
    instruments, did Huram his father make to king Solomon for the house of
    the LORD, of bright brass.
    </span><verse>17</verse><span>In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground
    between Succoth and Zeredathah.
    </span><verse>18</verse><span>Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance; for the weight
    of the brass could not be found out.

   <block>
    <verse>19</verse><span>And Solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of God, the

    the manner before the oracle, of pure gold;
    </span><verse>21</verse><span>and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, made he of gold, and
    that perfect gold.
    </span><verse>22</verse><span>And the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the censers, of
    pure gold; and the entry of the house, the inner doors thereof for the

    gold.

    <verse>2</verse><span>Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the
    tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto
    Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the
    city of David, which is Zion.
    </span><verse>3</verse><span>Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king in
    the feast which was in the seventh month.

   <block>
    <verse>4</verse><span>And all the elders of Israel came; and the Levites took up the ark.
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the congregation,
    and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, these did the
    priests and the Levites bring up.
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were
    assembled unto him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen, which
    could not be told nor numbered for multitude.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>7</verse><span>And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his
    place, to the oracle of the house, into the most holy pace, even under
    the wings of the cherubim;
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>for the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark,
    and the cherubim covered the ark and the staves thereof above.
    </span><verse>9</verse><span>And they drew out the staves of the ark, that the
    ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they
    were not seen without. And there it is unto this day.
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>There was nothing in the ark save the two
    tables which Moses put therein at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant
    with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>11</verse><span>And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place;
    (for all the priests that were present were sanctified, and did not then
    wait by course;
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>also the Levites which were the singers, all of them of Asaph, of
    Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren, being arrayed in
    white linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east
    end of the altar, and with them a hundred and twenty priests sounding
    with trumpets)
    </span><verse>13</verse><span>it came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as one, to
    make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the LORD; and when
    they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments
    of music, and praised the LORD, saying, “For he is good; for his mercy
    endureth forever;” that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the
    house of the LORD;
    </span><verse>14</verse><span>so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud;
    for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of God.

    saying, “For he is good; for his mercy endureth forever.”

    </span><verse>6</verse><span>And the priests waited on their offices; the Levites also with
    instruments of music of the LORD, which David the king had made to

    <verse>7</verse><span>Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the

    not able to receive the burnt offerings, and the meat offerings, and the
    fat.
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel
    with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto
    the river of Egypt.

    <verse>1</verse><span>And Rehoboam went to Shechem; for to Shechem were all Israel come to
    make him king.
    </span><verse>2</verse><span>And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was in Egypt
    whither he had fled from the presence of Solomon the king, heard it,
    that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.
    </span><verse>3</verse><span>And they sent and called him. So Jeroboam and all Israel came and spake
    to Rehoboam, saying:</span><quote>
     <verse>4</verse><span>Thy father made our yoke grievous; now therefore ease thou somewhat the
     grievous servitude of thy father, and his heavy yoke that he put upon
     us, and we will serve thee.</span></quote>
   </block>

   <block>
    <verse>5</verse><span>And he said unto them, “Come again unto me after three days.” And the
    people departed.
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood
    before
    Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, “What counsel give ye me to
    return answer to this people?”
    </span><verse>7</verse><span>And they spake
    unto him, saying:
    </span><quote><span>
     If thou be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to
     them, they will be thy servants forever.
    </span></quote>
   </block>

   <block>
    <verse>8</verse><span>But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and took counsel
    with the young men that were brought up with him, that stood before him.
    </span><verse>9</verse><span>And he said unto them, “What advice give ye that we may return answer
    to this people, which have spoken to me, saying, ‘Ease somewhat the yoke
    that thy father did put upon us?’”
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>And the young men that were brought up with him spake unto him,
    saying:</span><quote><span>
     Thus shalt thou answer the people that spake unto thee, saying, “Thy
     father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it somewhat lighter for us;”
     thus shalt thou say unto them, “My little finger shall be thicker than my
     father’s loins.
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>For whereas my father put a
     heavy yoke upon you, I will put more to your yoke; my father chastised you
     with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.”
    </span></quote>
   </block>

   <block>
    <verse>12</verse><span>So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as
    the king bade, saying, “Come again to me on the third day.”
    </span><verse>13</verse><span>And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the
    counsel of the old men,
    </span><verse>14</verse><span>And answered them after the advice of the young men, saying, “My father
    made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto; my father chastised you
    with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.”
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>So the king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause was of God,
    that the LORD might perform his word, which he spake by the hand of
    Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.

    </span><verse>12</verse><span>And in every several city he put shields and spears, and made them
    exceeding strong, having Judah and Benjamin on his side.

   <block>
    <verse>13</verse><span>And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted to him
    out of all their coasts.
    </span><verse>14</verse><span>For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to
    Judah and
    Jerusalem; for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing
    the priest’s office unto the LORD.
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>And he ordained him priests for the high
    places, and for the devils, and for the calves which he had made.
    </span><verse>16</verse><span>And after them, out of all the tribes of
    Israel, such as set their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came to
    Jerusalem, to sacrifice unto the LORD God of their fathers.

    </span><verse>2</verse><span>And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, Shishak
    king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed

    </span><verse>3</verse><span>With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen; and the
    people were without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubim,

   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>5</verse><span>Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and to the princes of

    said unto them:</span><quote><span>
     Thus saith the LORD: Ye have forsaken me, and therefore have I also left
     you in the hand of Shishak.
    </span></quote>
   </block>

   <block>
    <verse>6</verse><span>Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and
    they said, “The LORD is righteous.”
    </span><verse>7</verse><span>And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the
    LORD came to Shemaiah, saying:</span><quote><span>
     They have humbled themselves; therefore I will not destroy them, but I
     will grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out
     upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that

   <block>
    <verse>9</verse><span>So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the

    house; he took all; he carried away also the shields of gold which
    Solomon had made.
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and committed
    them to the hands of the chief of the guard, that kept the entrance of
    the king’s house.
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, the guard came

      sacrifices and sweet incense; the showbread also set they in order upon

   <block>
    <verse>1</verse><span>In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha king of
    Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he
    might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>2</verse><span>Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house
    of the LORD and of the king’s house, and sent to Ben-Hadad king of
    Syria, that dwelt in Damascus, saying:</span><quote>
     <verse>3</verse><span>There is a league between me and thee, as there was between my father
     and thy
     father; behold, I have sent thee silver and gold; go, break thy league
     with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.
    </span></quote>
   </block>

   <block>
    <verse>4</verse><span>And Ben-Hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his
    armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and
    Abel-maim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>And it came to pass, when Baasha heard it, that he left off building of
    Ramah, and let his work cease.
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the
    stones
    of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha was building; and he
    built therewith Geba and Mizpah.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>7</verse><span>And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said
    unto him:
    </span><quote><span>Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and not relied
    on the LORD thy God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped
    out of thine hand.
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubim a huge host, with very many
     chariots and horsemen? Yet, because thou didst rely on the LORD, he
     delivered them into thine hand.
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>For the
     eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show
     himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him.
     Herein thou hast done foolishly; therefore from henceforth thou shalt have
     wars.
    </span></quote>
   </block>

   <block>
    <verse>10</verse><span>Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison house; for he
    was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa oppressed some of
    the people the same time.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>11</verse><span>And, behold, the acts of Asa first and last, lo, they are written in
    the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his
    feet, until his disease was exceeding great; yet in his disease he
    sought not to the LORD, but to the physicians.
    </span><verse>13</verse><span>And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year
    of his reign.
    </span><verse>14</verse><span>And they buried him in his own sepulchers, which he had made for
    himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled
    with sweet odors and divers kinds of spices prepared by the
    apothecaries’ art; and they made a very great burning for him.

   <block>
    <verse>1</verse><span>And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened himself
    against Israel.
    </span><verse>2</verse><span>And he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah, and set
    garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa
    his father had taken.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>3</verse><span>And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways
    of his father David, and sought not unto Baalim;
    </span><verse>4</verse><span>but sought to the LORD God of his father, and walked in his
    commandments, and not after the doings of Israel.
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>Therefore the LORD stablished the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah
    brought to Jehoshaphat presents; and he had riches and honor in
    abundance.
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD; moreover he took
    away the high places and groves out of Judah.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>7</verse><span>Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes, even to
    Ben-hail, and to Obadiah, and to Zechariah, and to Nethaneel, and to
    Michaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah.
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>And with them he sent Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and
    Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and

    </span><verse>9</verse><span>And they taught in Judah, and had the book of the law of the LORD with

   <block>
    <verse>10</verse><span>And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that
    were round about Judah, so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat.
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>Also some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and tribute
    silver; and the Arabians brought him flocks, seven thousand and seven
    hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred he goats.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>12</verse><span>And Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in Judah castles,
    and cities of store.
    </span><verse>13</verse><span>And he had much business in the cities of Judah; and the men of war,
    mighty men of valor, were in Jerusalem.
    </span><verse>14</verse><span>And these are the numbers of them according to the house of their
    fathers: of Judah, the captains of thousands; Adnah the chief, and with
    him mighty men of valor three hundred thousand.
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>And next to him was Jehohanan the captain, and
    with him two hundred and fourscore thousand.

   <block>
    <verse>1</verse><span>Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance, and joined affinity
    with Ahab.
    </span><verse>2</verse><span>And after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab
    killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that he
    had with him, and persuaded him to go up with him to Ramoth-Gilead.
    </span><verse>3</verse><span>And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, “Wilt thou
    go with me to Ramoth-Gilead?” And he answered him, “I am as thou art,
    and my people as thy people; and we will be with thee in the war.”
    </span><verse>4</verse><span>And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, “Inquire, I pray thee, at
    the word of the LORD today.”
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>5</verse><span>Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred
    men, and said unto them, “Shall we go to Ramoth-Gilead to battle, or
    shall I forbear?” And they said, “Go up; for God will deliver it into
    the king’s hand.”
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>But Jehoshaphat said:</span><quote><span>
     Is there not here a prophet of the LORD, besides, that we might inquire of
     him?
    </span></quote>
   </block>

   <block>
    <verse>7</verse><span>And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat:</span><quote><span>
     There is yet one man, by whom we may inquire of the LORD; but I hate him;
     for he never prophesied good unto me, but always evil; the same is Micaiah
     the son of Imla.
    </span></quote>
   </block>

   <block><span>
    And Jehoshaphat said, “Let not the king say so.”
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>And the king of Israel called for one of his

   </span></block>

    on his throne, clothed in their robes, and they sat in a void place at
    the entering in of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied
    before them.
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron, and said,
    “Thus saith the LORD: With these thou shalt push Syria until they be
    consumed.”
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>And all the prophets prophesied so, saying,” Go up to Ramothgilead, and
    prosper; for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king.”

    <verse>12</verse><span>And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him, saying:</span><quote><span>
     Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one

     speak thou good.
    </span></quote>

   <block>
    <verse>14</verse><span>And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, “Micaiah,
    shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear?” And he said,
    “Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand.”
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>And the king said to him, “How many times shall I adjure thee that thou
    say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the LORD?”
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>16</verse><span>Then he said:</span><quote><span>
     I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no

     therefore every man to his house in peace.

    <verse>18</verse><span>Again he said:

      throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his
      left.
      </span><verse>19</verse><span>And the LORD said, “Who shall entice
      Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead?” And one
      spake saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner.
      </span><verse>20</verse><span>Then there came out a lying spirit, and stood
      before them, and said,” I will entice him.” And the LORD said unto him,
      “Wherewith?”
      </span><verse>21</verse><span>And he said, “I will go out, and
      be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.” And the LORD said,
      “Thou shalt entice him, and thou shalt also prevail; go out, and do even
      so; for all these have sinned against me.”
     </span></block>

     <block>

    and God moved them to depart from him.
    </span><verse>32</verse><span>For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots perceived
    that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back again from pursuing
    him.
    </span><verse>33</verse><span>And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel
    between the joints of the harness; therefore he said to his chariot man,

    king of Israel, who did very wickedly;

    they made the ships in Ezion-Geber.

     thy brethren of thy father’s house, which were better than thyself;
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>behold, with a great plague will the LORD

    captive, and brought them unto the top of the rock, and cast them down

    <verse>13</verse><span>But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that they should

   <block>
    <verse>14</verse><span>Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of
    the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set
    them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned
    incense unto them.
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah, and he
    sent unto him a prophet, which said unto him:</span><quote><span>
     Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which could not deliver
     their own people out of thine hand?
    </span></quote>
   </block>

   <block>
    <verse>16</verse><span>And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that the king said unto
    him, “Art thou made of the king’s counsel? Forbear; why shouldest thou
    be smitten?” Then the prophet forbare, and said, “I know that God hath
    determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not
    hearkened unto my counsel.”
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>17</verse><span>Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of
    Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, “Come, let us see one
    another in the face.”
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>18</verse><span>And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, “The
    thistle that grew in Lebanon sent to the cedar that grew in Lebanon,
    saying, ‘Give thy daughter to my son to wife; and there passed by a wild
    beast that was in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle.’
    </span><verse>19</verse><span>Thou sayest, ‘Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thine heart
    lifteth thee up to boast;’ abide now at home; why shouldest thou meddle
    to thine hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou and Judah with

    <verse>20</verse><span>But Amaziah would not hear; for it came of
    God, that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because
    they sought after the gods of Edom.

    the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another in the face, both he
    and Amaziah king of Judah, at Beth-Shemesh, which belongeth to Judah.

    the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son

    king against the enemy.
    </span><verse>14</verse><span>And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields, and
    spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings to cast
    stones.
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to be on the

    </span><verse>17</verse><span>And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore

     It appertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the LORD, but
     to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense; go
     out of the sanctuary; for thou hast trespassed; neither shall it be for

    </span><verse>20</verse><span>And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon him,

    </span><verse>30</verse><span>Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to
    sing praise unto the LORD with the words of David, and of Asaph the

    <verse>31</verse><span>Then Hezekiah answered and said:</span><quote><span>

   <block><span>
    And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as
    many as were of a free heart, burnt offerings.
    </span><verse>32</verse><span>And the number of the burnt offerings, which
    the congregation brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, a hundred rams,
    and two hundred lambs; all these were for a burnt offering to the LORD.
    </span><verse>33</verse><span>And the consecrated things were six hundred
    oxen and three thousand sheep.
    </span><verse>34</verse><span>But the priests
    were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings;
    wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was
    ended, and until the other priests had sanctified themselves; for the
    Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the
    priests.
    </span><verse>35</verse><span>And also the burnt offerings were in
    abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings, and the drink offerings
    for every burnt offering. So the service of the house of the LORD was set
    in order.

   <block>
    <verse>1</verse><span>And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to
    Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at
    Jerusalem, to keep the Passover unto the LORD God of Israel.
    </span><verse>2</verse><span>For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the
    congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the Passover in the second month.
    </span><verse>3</verse><span>For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not
    sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people gathered
    themselves together to Jerusalem.
    </span><verse>4</verse><span>And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation.
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all
    Israel, from Beer-Sheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the
    Passover unto the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem; for they had not done
    it of a long time in such sort as it was written.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>6</verse><span>So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes
    throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the
    king, saying:</span><quote><span>
     Ye children of Israel, turn again unto the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and
     Israel, and he will return to the remnant of you, that are escaped out of
     the hand of the kings of Assyria.
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>And be not ye
     like your fathers, and like your brethren, which trespassed against the
     LORD God of their fathers, who therefore gave them up to desolation, as ye
     see.
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>Now be ye not stiff-necked, as your
     fathers were, but yield yourselves unto the LORD, and enter into his
     sanctuary, which he hath sanctified forever; and serve the LORD your God,
     that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you.
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>For if ye turn again unto the LORD, your
     brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that lead
     them captive, so that they shall come again into this land; for the LORD
     your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from
     you, if ye return unto him.

    </span><verse>12</verse><span>Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the

   <block>
    <verse>15</verse><span>Then they killed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the second

    </span><verse>16</verse><span>And they stood in their places after their manner, according to the law
    of Moses the man of God; the priests sprinkled the blood, which they
    received of the hand of the Levites.
    </span><verse>17</verse><span>For there were many in the congregation that were not sanctified;
    therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the Passovers for
    everyone that was not clean, to sanctify them unto the LORD.
    </span><verse>18</verse><span>For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim and Manasseh,
    Issachar and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the
    Passover otherwise than it was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them,
    saying:</span><quote><span>
     The good LORD pardon everyone

    </span><verse>22</verse><span>And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught the

   <block>
    <verse>23</verse><span>And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days; and they

    </span><verse>24</verse><span>For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a thousand
    bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the
    congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep; and a great
    number of priests sanctified themselves.
    </span><verse>25</verse><span>And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites,
    and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that
    came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.

    give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the tents of the LORD.
    </span><verse>3</verse><span>He appointed also the king’s portion of his substance for the burnt
