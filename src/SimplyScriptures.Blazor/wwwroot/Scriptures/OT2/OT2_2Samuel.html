  David learns of the death of Saul and Jonathan
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>1
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned
  from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in
  Ziklag;
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>it came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of
  the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head; and
  so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did
  obeisance.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>And David said unto him, “From whence comest thou?” And he said unto
  him, “Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.”
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And David said unto him, “How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me.”
  And he answered:</span><quote><span>
   That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are
   fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>And David said unto the young man that told him:</span><quote><span>
   How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And the young man that told him said:</span><quote><span>
   As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his
   spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.
   </span><verse>7</verse><span>And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and
   called unto me. And I answered, “Here am I.”
   </span><verse>8</verse><span>And he said unto me, “Who art thou?” And I
   answered him, “I am an Amalekite.”
   </span><verse>9</verse><span>He said unto
   me again, “Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me; for anguish is come
   upon me, because my life is yet whole in me.”
   </span><verse>10</verse><span>So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I
   was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen; and I took the
   crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm and
   have brought them hither unto my lord.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all
  the men that were with him.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for
  Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of
  Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>And David said unto the young man that told him, “Whence art thou?” And
  he answered, “I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.”
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And David said unto him. “How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth
  thine hand to destroy the LORD’s anointed?”
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>And David called one of the young men, and said, “Go near, and fall
  upon him.” And he smote him that he died.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And David said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee,
   saying, “I have slain the LORD’s anointed.”
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan
  his son;
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>(also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow; behold, it is
  written in the book of Jasher):
  </span><quote>
   <block>
    <verse>19</verse><span>The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places; how are the mighty
    fallen!</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>20</verse><span>Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the
    daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the
    uncircumcised triumph.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>21</verse><span>Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain,
    upon you, nor fields of offerings; for there the shield of the mighty is
    vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed
    with oil.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>22</verse><span>From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of
    Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.
    </span><verse>23</verse><span>Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their
    death they were not divided; they were swifter than eagles, they were
    stronger than lions.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>24</verse><span>Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet,
    with other delights; who put on ornaments of gold upon your
    apparel.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>25</verse><span>How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, thou
    wast slain in thine high places.
    </span><verse>26</verse><span>I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan; very pleasant hast thou
    been unto me; thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of
    women.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>27</verse><span>How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!</span></block>

  David anointed king of Judah
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>2
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And it came to pass after this, that David inquired of the LORD,
  saying:
  </span><quote><span>Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah?</span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>And the LORD said unto him, “Go up.”</span></block>

 <block><span>And David said, “Whither shall I go up?”</span></block>

 <block><span>
  And he said, “Unto Hebron.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the
  Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal’s wife the Carmelite.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his
  household; and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the
  house of Judah. And they told David, saying that the men of
  Jabesh-Gilead were they that buried Saul.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabesh-Gilead, and said unto
  them:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>
    Blessed be ye of the LORD, that ye have showed this kindness unto your
    lord, even unto Saul, and have buried him.
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>And
    now the LORD show kindness and truth unto you; and I also will requite you
    this kindness, because ye have done this thing.
    </span><verse>7</verse><span>Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant; for
    your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me
    king over them.</span></block>

  War between the houses of Saul and David
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul’s host, took Ishbosheth the
  son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>and made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over
  Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>Ishbosheth Saul’s son was forty years old when he began to reign over
  Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was
  seven years and six months.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of
  Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and
  met together by the pool of Gibeon; and they sat down, the one on the
  one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>And Abner said to Joab, “Let the young men now arise, and play before
  us.”
 </span></block>

 <block><span>And Joab said, “Let them arise.”</span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, which
  pertained to Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of
  David.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And they caught every
  one his fellow by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow’s side; so
  they fell down together; wherefore that place was called Helkath-Zazzurim,
  which is in Gibeon.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was beaten, and
  the men of Israel, before the servants of David.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai, and
  Asahel; and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right
  hand nor to the left from following Abner.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>Then Abner looked behind him, and said, “Art thou Asahel?” And he
  answered, “I am.”
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>And Abner said to him:</span><quote><span>
   Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay thee hold on one
   of the young men, and take thee his armor.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  But Asahel would not turn aside from following of him.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>And Abner said again to Asahel:
  </span><quote><span>Turn thee
  aside from following me; wherefore should I smite thee to the ground?
  How then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?</span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>Howbeit he refused to turn aside; wherefore Abner with the hinder end
  of the spear smote him under the fifth rib, that the spear came out
  behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place; and it
  came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down
  and died stood still.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner; and the sun went down when
  they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giah by the way
  of the wilderness of Gibeon.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner,
  and became one troop, and stood on the top of a hill.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>26</verse><span>Then Abner called to Joab, and said:</span><quote><span>
   Shall the sword devour forever? Knowest thou not that it will be a
   bitterness in the latter end? How long shall it be then, ere thou bid the
   people return from following their brethren?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>27</verse><span>And Joab said:</span><quote><span>
   As God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely then in the morning the
   people had gone up every one from following his brother.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>28</verse><span>So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued
  after Israel no more, neither fought they anymore.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>29</verse><span>And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain, and
  passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to
  Mahanaim.
  </span><verse>30</verse><span>And Joab returned from following Abner; and when he had gathered all
  the people together, there lacked of David’s servants nineteen men and
  Asahel.
  </span><verse>31</verse><span>But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner’s men,
  so that three hundred and threescore men died.
  </span><verse>32</verse><span>And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulcher of his father,
  which was in Bethlehem.
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at break of
  day.
 </span></block>

 <chapter>3
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of
  David; but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul
  waxed weaker and weaker.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>And unto David were sons born in Hebron, and his first-born was Amnon,
  of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>and his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite;
  and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of
  Geshur;
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah
  the son of Abital;
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>and the sixth, Ithream by Eglah David’s wife. These were born to David
  in Hebron.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  Abner joins David
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and
  the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of
  Saul.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah;
  and Ishbosheth said to Abner:</span><quote><span>
   Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father’s concubine?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and said:</span><quote><span>
   Am I a dog’s head, which against Judah do show kindness this day unto the
   house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have
   not delivered thee into the hand of David, that thou chargest me today
   with a fault concerning this woman?
   </span><verse>9</verse><span>So do God
   to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD hath sworn to David, even so
   I do to him.
   </span><verse>10</verse><span>To translate the kingdom from the
   house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over
   Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, “Whose is the
  land?” Saying also:</span><quote><span>
   Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring
   about all Israel unto thee.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>And he said:</span><quote><span>
   Well; I will make a league with thee; but one thing I require of thee,
   that is, thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal Saul’s
   daughter, when thou comest to see my face.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul’s son, saying:</span><quote><span>
   Deliver me my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for a hundred foreskins
   of the Philistines.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Phaltiel
  the son of Laish.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim. Then
  said Abner unto him, “Go, return.” And he returned.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying:</span><quote><span>
   Ye sought for David in times past to be king over you;
   </span><verse>18</verse><span>now then do it; for the LORD hath spoken of
   David, saying, “By the hand of my servant David I will save my people
   Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all
   their enemies.”
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin; and Abner went also to
  speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and
  that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David
  made Abner and his men that were with him a feast.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>And Abner said unto David:</span><quote><span>
   I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king,
   that they may make a league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all
   that thine heart desireth.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  Joab kills Abner
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing a troop,
  and brought in a great spoil with them; but Abner was not with David in
  Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told Joab,
  saying:</span><quote><span>
   Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he
   is gone in peace.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>Then Joab came to the king, and said:</span><quote><span>
   What hast thou done? Behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou
   hast sent him away, and he is quite gone?
   </span><verse>25</verse><span>Thou
   knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know
   thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>26</verse><span>And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner,
  which brought him again from the well of Sirah; but David knew it not.
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate
  to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the fifth rib, that
  he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>28</verse><span>And afterward when David heard it, he said:</span><quote><span>
   I and my kingdom are guiltless before the LORD forever from the blood of
   Abner the son of Ner;
   </span><verse>29</verse><span>let it rest on the head
   of Joab, and on all his father’s house; and let there not fail from the
   house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth
   on a staff, or that falleth on the sword, or that lacketh bread.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>30</verse><span>So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain their
  brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>31</verse><span>And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him:</span><quote><span>
   Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And king David himself followed the bier.
  </span><verse>32</verse><span>And
  they buried Abner in Hebron; and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at
  the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.
  </span><verse>33</verse><span>And the king lamented over Abner, and said:
  </span><quote><span>
   Died Abner as a fool dieth?
   </span><verse>34</verse><span>Thy hands were not
   bound, nor thy feet put into fetters; as a man falleth before wicked men,
   so fellest thou.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And all the people wept again over him.
  </span><verse>35</verse><span>And
  when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while it was yet day,
  David sware, saying:
  </span><quote><span>
   So do God to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or aught else, till the
   sun be down.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>36</verse><span>And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them; as
  whatsoever the king did pleased all the people.
  </span><verse>37</verse><span>For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not
  of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>38</verse><span>And the king said unto his servants:</span><quote><span>
   Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in
   Israel?
   </span><verse>39</verse><span>And I am this day weak, though
   anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah be too hard for me; the
   LORD shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness.

  Ishbosheth is killed
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>4
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And when Saul’s son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands were
  feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And Saul’s son had two men that were captains of bands; the name of the
  one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon a
  Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin. (for Beeroth also was reckoned
  to Benjamin;
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners there until
  this day.)
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>And Jonathan, Saul’s son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was
  five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of
  Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled, and it came to pass, as
  she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was
  Mephibosheth.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and
  came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who lay on a
  bed at noon.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And they came
  thither into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched
  wheat; and they smote him under the fifth rib; and Rechab and Baanah his
  brother escaped.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his bedchamber,
  and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head,
  and gat them away through the plain all night.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron, and said
  to the king:</span><quote><span>
   Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul thine enemy, which sought
   thy life; and the LORD hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and
   of his seed.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon
  the Beerothite, and said unto them:</span><quote><span>
   As the LORD liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,
   </span><verse>10</verse><span>when one told me, saying, “Behold, Saul is
   dead,” thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew
   him in Ziklag, who thought that I would have given him a reward for his
   tidings;
   </span><verse>11</verse><span>how much more, when wicked men have
   slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed? Shall I not
   therefore now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the
   earth?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off
  their hands and their feet, and hanged them up over the pool in Hebron.
  But they took the head of Ishbosheth, and buried it in the sepulcher of
  Abner in Hebron.

 <chapter>5
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake,
  saying, “Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that
  leddest out and broughtest in Israel; and the LORD said to thee, ‘Thou
  shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a captain over
  Israel.’”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David
  made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed
  David king over Israel.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty
  years.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months; and in
  Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and
  Judah.

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the
  inhabitants of the land; which spake unto David, saying, “Except thou
  take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither;”
  thinking, David cannot come in hither.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>Nevertheless, David took the stronghold of Zion; the same is the city
  of David.

  <verse>17</verse><span>But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over
  Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David heard of
  it, and went down to the hold.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of
  Rephaim.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And David inquired of the LORD, saying:</span><quote><span>
   Shall I go up to the Philistines? Wilt thou deliver them into mine hand?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And the LORD said unto David:
  </span><quote><span>
   Go up; for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thine hand.

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>And David came to Baalperazim, and David smote them there, and
  said:</span><quote><span>
   The LORD hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me, as the breach of

  </span></quote>

 <block><span>
  Therefore he called the name of that place Baal-Perazim.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>And there they left their images, and David
  and his men burned them.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the

  </span><verse>23</verse><span>And when David inquired of the LORD, he said:</span><quote><span>
   Thou shalt not go up; but fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them
   over against the mulberry trees.
   </span><verse>24</verse><span>And let it
   be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry
   trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself; for then shall the LORD go out
   before thee, to smite the host of the Philistines.

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Again, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty
  thousand.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from
  Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose name is
  called by the name of the LORD of hosts that dwelleth between the
  cherubim.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the
  house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah; and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of
  Abinadab, drave the new cart.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at Gibeah,
  accompanying the ark of God; and Ahio went before the ark.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on all
  manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps, and on
  psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And when they came to Nachon’s threshing floor, Uzzah put forth his
  hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah, and God smote him
  there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon
  Uzzah; and he called the name of the place Perez-Uzzah to this
  day.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said:
  </span><quote><span>How shall the ark
  of the LORD come to me?</span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>So David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into the city of
  David; but David carried it aside into the house of Obed-Edom the
  Gittite.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And the ark of the
  LORD continued in the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite three months; and the
  LORD blessed Obed-Edom, and all his household.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>And it was told king David, saying:</span><quote><span>
   The LORD hath blessed the house of Obed-Edom, and all that pertaineth unto
   him, because of the ark of God.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-Edom
 into the city of David with gladness.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And it was so, that when they that bare the
  ark of the LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And David danced before the LORD with all his
  might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>So David and all the house of Israel brought
  up the ark of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal Saul’s
  daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing
  before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his place, in
  the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it; and David
  offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offering and
  peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of
  Israel, as well to the women as men, to everyone a cake of bread, and a
  good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine. So all the people departed
  everyone to his house.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of
  Saul came out to meet David, and said:</span><quote><span>
   How glorious was the king of Israel today, who uncovered himself today in
   the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows
   shamelessly uncovereth himself!
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>And David said unto Michal:</span><quote><span>
   It was before the LORD, which chose me before thy father, and before all
   his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel;
   therefore will I play before the LORD;
   </span><verse>22</verse><span>and I
   will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in mine own sight; and
   of the maidservants which thou has spoken of, of them shall I be had in
   honor.

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the LORD had

   <block>
    <verse>5</verse><span>Go and tell my servant David, “Thus said the LORD: Shalt thou build me
    a house for me to dwell in?
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>Whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up
    the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked
    in a tent and in a tabernacle.
    </span><verse>7</verse><span>In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel
    spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to
    feed my people Israel, saying, ‘Why build ye not me a house of
    cedar?’”</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>8</verse><span>Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, “Thus saith the
    LORD of hosts: I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep,
    to be ruler over my people, over Israel;
    </span><verse>9</verse><span>and I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all
    thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like
    unto the name of the great men that are in the earth.
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant
    them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more;
    neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them anymore, as before
    time,
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>and as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people
    Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the
    LORD telleth thee that he will make thee a house.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>12</verse><span>And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers,
    I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy
    bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.
    </span><verse>13</verse><span>He shall build a house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of
    his kingdom forever.
    </span><verse>14</verse><span>I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I
    will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the
    children of men.
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from Saul,
    whom I put away before thee.
    </span><verse>16</verse><span>And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established forever before
    thee; thy throne shall be established forever.”</span></block>

    heard with our ears.
    </span><verse>23</verse><span>And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like Israel,
    whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name,
    and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy
    people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, from the nations and
    their gods?

    hast said.
    </span><verse>26</verse><span>And let thy name be magnified forever, saying, “The LORD of hosts is
    the God over Israel;” and let the house of thy servant David be
    established before thee.
    </span><verse>27</verse><span>For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant,

  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And David sent and inquired after the woman. And one said, “Is not this
  Bath-Sheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?”
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him and
  he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness; and she
  returned unto her house.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, “I am with
  child.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And David sent to Joab, saying, “Send me Uriah the Hittite.” And Joab
  sent Uriah to David.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And when Uriah was come unto him, David demanded of him how Joab did,
  and how the people did, and how the war prospered.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>And David said to Uriah:</span><quote><span>
   Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And Uriah departed out of the king’s house, and there followed him a mess
  of meat from the king.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>But Uriah slept at the
  door of the king’s house with all the servants of his lord, and went not
  down to his house.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And when they had told
  David, saying, “Uriah went not down unto his house,” David said unto
  Uriah:
  </span><quote><span>
   Camest thou not from thy journey? Why then didst thou not go down unto
   thine house?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>And Uriah said unto David:</span><quote><span>
   The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the
   servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into
   mine house, to eat and drink, and to lie with my wife? As thou livest, and
   as thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>And David said to Uriah:</span><quote><span>
   Tarry here today also, and tomorrow I will let thee depart.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the morrow.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And when David had called him, he did eat and
  drink before him; and he made him drunk; and at even he went out to lie on
  his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab,
  and sent it by the hand of Uriah.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>And he wrote in the letter, saying, “Set ye Uriah in the forefront of
  the hottest battle, and retire ye from him that he may be smitten, and
  die.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he assigned
  Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men were.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab; and there fell
  some of the people of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died
  also.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>and charged the messenger, saying:</span><quote><span>
   When thou hast made an end of telling the matters of the war unto the
   king,
   </span><verse>20</verse><span>and if so be that the king’s wrath
   arise, and he say unto thee, “Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the
   city when ye did fight? Knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall?
   </span><verse>21</verse><span>Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth?
   Did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that
   he died in Thebez? Why went ye nigh the wall?” Then say thou, “Thy servant
   Uriah the Hittite is dead also.”
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>So the messenger went, and came and showed David all that Joab had sent
  him for.
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>And the messenger said unto David:</span><quote><span>
   Surely the men prevailed against us, and came out unto us into the field,
   and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate.
   </span><verse>24</verse><span>And the shooters shot from off the wall upon
   thy servants; and some of the king’s servants be dead, and thy servant
   Uriah the Hittite is dead also.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>25</verse><span>Then David said unto the messenger:</span><quote><span>
   Thus shalt thou say unto Joab, “Let not this thing displease thee, for the
   sword devoureth one as well as another; make thy battle more strong
   against the city, and overthrow it;” and encourage thou him.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>26</verse><span>And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she
  mourned for her husband.
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to his
  house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But the thing that
  David had done displeased the LORD.

  Nathan rebukes David

 <chapter>12
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said
  unto him:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other
   poor.
    </span><verse>2</verse><span>The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds;
    </span><verse>3</verse><span>but the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had
    bought and nourished up; and it grew up together with him, and with his
    children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay
    in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>4</verse><span>And there came a traveler unto the rich man, and he spared to take of
    his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that
    was come unto him; but took the poor man’s lamb, and dressed it for the
    man that was come to him.</span></block>

  </quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>And David’s anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to
  Nathan:</span><quote><span>
   As the LORD liveth, the man that hath done this thing shall surely die;
   </span><verse>6</verse><span>and he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because
   he did this thing, and because he had no pity.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>And Nathan said to David:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>
    Thou art the man. Thus saith the LORD God of Israel: I anointed thee king
    over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>and I gave thee thy master’s house, and thy
    master’s wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of
    Judah; and if that had been too little, I would moreover have given unto
    thee such and such things.”
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>9</verse><span>Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in
    his sight? Thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast
    taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the
    children of Ammon.
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house; because
    thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to
    be thy wife.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>11</verse><span>Thus saith the LORD: Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of
    thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give
    them unto thy neighbor, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of
    this sun.
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>For thou didst it secretly; but I will do this thing before all Israel,
    and before the sun.</span></block>

  </quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>And David said unto Nathan, “I have sinned against the LORD.”</span></block>

 <block><span>
  And Nathan said unto David:</span><quote><span>
   The LORD also hath not put away thy sin that thou shalt not die.
   </span><verse>14</verse><span>Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given
   great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also
   that is born unto thee shall surely die.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the child that
  Uriah’s wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went
  in, and lay all night upon the earth.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him up
  from the earth; but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the
  servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead; for they
  said:</span><quote><span>
   Behold, while the child was yet alive we spake unto him, and he would not
   hearken unto our voice; how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that
   the child is dead?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that
  the child was dead; therefore David said unto his servants, “Is the
  child dead?” And they said, “He is dead.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and
  changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD, and worshiped;
  then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread
  before him, and he did eat.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>Then said his servants unto him:</span><quote><span>
   What thing is this that thou hast done? Thou didst fast and weep for the
   child, while it was alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise
   and eat bread.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>And he said:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>
    While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept; for I said, “Who can
    tell whether GOD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?”
    </span><verse>23</verse><span>But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him,
    but he shall not return to me.</span></block>

  <verse>24</verse><span>And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay

 <block>
  <verse>26</verse><span>And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the

   I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.
   </span><verse>28</verse><span>Now therefore gather the rest of the people

 <block>
  <verse>29</verse><span>And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and

 <block>
  <verse>30</verse><span>And he took their king’s crown from off his head, the weight whereof
  was a talent of gold with the precious stones; and it was set on David’s

  </span><verse>31</verse><span>And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under

  Amnon and Tamar
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>13
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a
  fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for she
  was a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do anything to
  her.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah
  David’s brother; and Jonadab was a very subtile man.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And he said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   Why art thou, being the king’s son, lean from day to day? Wilt thou not
   tell me?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And Amnon said unto him, “I love Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>And Jonadab said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself sick; and when thy father
   cometh to see thee, say unto him, “I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come,
   and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see it, and
   eat it at her hand.”
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>So Amnon lay down and made himself sick; and when the king was come to
  see him, Amnon said unto the king:</span><quote><span>
   I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my
   sight, that I may eat at her hand.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>Then David sent home to Tamar, saying:</span><quote><span>
   Go now to thy brother Amnon’s house, and dress him meat.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house; and he was laid down. And
  she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did
  bake the cakes.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to
  eat. And Amnon said:</span><quote><span>
   Have out all men from me.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And they went out every man from him.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And
  Amnon said unto Tamar: Bring the meat into the chamber, that I may eat of
  thine hand.
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the
  chamber to Amnon her brother.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And when she had
  brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her:
  </span><quote><span>
   Come lie with me, my sister.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>And she answered him:</span><quote><span>
   Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in
   Israel; do not thou this folly.
   </span><verse>13</verse><span>And I, whither
   shall I cause my shame to go? And as for thee, thou shalt be as one of the
   fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he
   will not withhold me from thee.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice; but, being stronger than
  she, forced her, and lay with her.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith he hated
  her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said
  to her:</span><quote><span>
   Arise, begone.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>And she said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   There is no cause; this evil in sending me away is greater than the other
   that thou didst unto me.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  But he would not hearken unto her.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>Then he
  called his servant that ministered unto him, and said:
  </span><quote><span>
   Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>And she had a garment of divers colors upon her; for with such robes
  were the king’s daughters that were virgins appareled. Then his servant
  brought her out, and bolted the door after her.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colors
  that was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And Absalom her brother said unto her, “Hath Amnon thy brother been
  with thee? But hold now thy peace, my sister; he is thy brother; regard
  not this thing.” So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom’s
  house.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad; for
  Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheep
  shearers in Baal-Hazor, which is beside Ephraim; and Absalom invited all
  the king’s sons.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>And Absalom came to the king, and said, “Behold now, thy servant hath
  sheep shearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and his servants go with
  thy servant.”
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>And the king said to Absalom, “Nay, my son, let us not all now go, lest
  we be chargeable unto thee.”
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  And he pressed him; howbeit he would not go, but blessed him.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>Then said Absalom, “If not, I pray thee, let
  my brother Amnon go with us.” And the king said unto him, “Why should he
  go with thee?”
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>But Absalom pressed him, that
  he let Amnon and all the king’s sons go with him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>28</verse><span>Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying:</span><quote><span>
   Mark ye now when Amnon’s heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto
   you, “Smite Amnon;” then kill him, fear not; have I not commanded you? Be
   courageous, and be valiant.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>29</verse><span>And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded.
  Then all the king’s sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his mule,
  and fled.
  </span><verse>30</verse><span>And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came to
  David, saying, “Absalom hath slain all the king’s sons, and there is not
  one of them left.”
  </span><verse>31</verse><span>Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the earth; and
  all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>32</verse><span>And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David’s brother, answered and
  said:</span><quote><span>
   Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the king’s
   sons; for Amnon only is dead; for by the appointment of Absalom this hath
   been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.
   </span><verse>33</verse><span>Now therefore let not my Lord the king take
   the thing to his heart, to think that all the king’s sons are dead; for
   Amnon only is dead.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>34</verse><span>But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his
  eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the
  hillside behind him.
  </span><verse>35</verse><span>And Jonadab said unto the king, “Behold, the king’s sons come; as thy
  servant said, so it is.”
  </span><verse>36</verse><span>And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that,
  behold, the king’s sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept; and
  the king also and all his servants wept very sore.
  </span><verse>37</verse><span>But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of
  Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>38</verse><span>So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.
  </span><verse>39</verse><span>And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom; for he was
  comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  Absalom returns to Jerusalem
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>14
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king’s heart was toward
  Absalom.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And
  Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her:
  </span><quote><span>
   I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning
   apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had a
   long time mourned for the dead;
   </span><verse>3</verse><span>and come to the
   king, and speak on this manner unto him.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  So Joab put the words in her mouth.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And when
  the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fell on her face to the ground,
  and did obeisance, and said, “Help, O king.”
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And the king said unto her, “What aileth thee?”
  And she answered:
  </span><quote><span>
   I am indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead.
   </span><verse>6</verse><span>And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two
   strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one
   smote the other, and slew him.
   </span><verse>7</verse><span>And, behold, the
   whole family is risen against thine handmaid, and they said, “Deliver him
   that smote his brother, that we may kill him, for the life of his brother
   whom he slew; and we will destroy the heir also;” and so they will quench
   my coal which is left, and shalt not leave to my husband neither name nor
   remainder upon the earth.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>And the king said unto the woman, “Go to thine house, and I will give
  charge concerning thee.”
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, “My lord, O king, the
  iniquity be on me, and on my father’s house; and the king and his throne
  be guiltless.”
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And the king said, “Whosoever saith aught unto thee, bring him to me,
  and he shall not touch thee anymore”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>Then said she, “I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy God,
  that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy anymore,
  lest they destroy my son.” And he said, “As the LORD liveth, there shall
  not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>Then the woman said, “Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak one word
  unto my lord the king.” And he said, “Say on.”
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And the woman said:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>
    Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God?
    For the king doth speak this thing as one which is faulty, in that the
    king doth not fetch home again his banished.
    </span><verse>14</verse><span>For we must needs die, and are as water spilt
    on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect
    any person; yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not expelled
    from him.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>15</verse><span>Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the

    said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will
    perform the request of his handmaid.
    </span><verse>16</verse><span>For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the

   hath thy servant Joab done this thing; and my lord is wise, according to
   the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>And the king said unto Joab, “Behold now, I have done this thing; go
  therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.”
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and thanked
  the king; and Joab said, “Today thy servant knoweth that I have found
  grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath fulfilled the
  request of his servant.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>And the king said, “Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see
  my face.” So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the king’s
  face.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>25</verse><span>But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for
  his beauty; from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head
  there was no blemish in him.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year’s end that he
  polled it; because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled it) he
  weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king’s
  weight.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>27</verse><span>And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose
  name was Tamar; she was a woman of a fair countenance.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>28</verse><span>So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king’s
  face.
  </span><verse>29</verse><span>Therefore
  Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king; but he would not come
  to him; and when he sent again the second time, he would not come.
  </span><verse>30</verse><span>Therefore he said unto his servants, “See,
  Joab’s field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on
  fire.” And Absalom’s servants set the field on fire.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>31</verse><span>Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house and said unto him,
  “Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?”
  </span><verse>32</verse><span>And Absalom answered Joab:</span><quote><span>
   Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, “Come hither, that I may send thee to
   the king, to say, ‘Wherefore am I come from Geshur? It had been good for
   me to have been there still;’” now therefore let me see the king’s face;
   and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>33</verse><span>So Joab came to the king, and told him; and when he had called for
  Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the
  ground before the king; and the king kissed Absalom.

  Absalom’s conspiracy
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>15
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and
  horses, and fifty men to run before him.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate; and it
  was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for
  judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, “Of what city art
  thou?” And he said, “Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.”
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And Absalom said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the
   king to hear thee.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Absalom said moreover:</span><quote><span>
   Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit
   or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him to do him obeisance,
  he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for
  judgment; so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the
  king:</span><quote><span>
   I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD,
   in Hebron.
   </span><verse>8</verse><span>For thy servant vowed a vow while I
   abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, “If the LORD shall bring me again indeed
   to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.”
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>And the king said unto him, “Go in peace.”
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  So he arose, and went to Hebron.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>But Absalom
  sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying:
  </span><quote><span>
   As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, “Absalom
   reigneth in Hebron.”
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were
  called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not anything.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counselor, from
  his city, even from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the
  conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with
  Absalom.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>And there came a messenger to David, saying:</span><quote><span>
   The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>And David said unto all his servants that were with him at
  Jerusalem:</span><quote><span>
   Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else escape from Absalom; make
   speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and
   smite the city with the edge of the sword.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And the king’s servants said unto the king:</span><quote><span>
   Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall
   appoint.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king
  left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the house.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a
  place that was far off.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and
  all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came
  after him from Gath, passed on before the king.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite:</span><quote><span>
   Wherefore goest thou also with us? Return to thy place, and abide with the
   king; for thou art a stranger, and also an exile.
   </span><verse>20</verse><span>Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I
   this day make thee go up and down with us? Seeing I go whither I may,
   return thou, and take back thy brethren; mercy and truth be with thee.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>And Ittai answered the king, and said:</span><quote><span>
   As the LORD liveth, and as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place
   my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will
   thy servant be.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>And David said to Ittai, “Go and pass over.” And Ittai the Gittite
  passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with
  him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed
  over; the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the
  people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>And lo, Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing the ark
  of the covenant of God; and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar
  went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>25</verse><span>And the king said unto Zadok:</span><quote><span>
   Carry back the ark of God into the city; if I shall find favor in the eyes
   of the LORD, he will bring me again, and show me both it, and his
   habitation;
   </span><verse>26</verse><span>but if he thus say, “I have no
   delight in thee;” behold, here am I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto
   him.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>27</verse><span>The king said also unto Zadok the priest:</span><quote><span>
   Art not thou a seer? Return into the city in peace, and your two sons with
   you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.
   </span><verse>28</verse><span>See, I will tarry in the plain of the
   wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>29</verse><span>Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem;
  and they tarried there.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>30</verse><span>And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he went
  up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot; and all the people
  that was with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping
  as they went up.
  </span><verse>31</verse><span>And one told David, saying, “Ahithophel is among the conspirators with
  Absalom.” And David said, “O Lord, I pray thee, turn the counsel of
  Ahithophel into foolishness.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>32</verse><span>And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of the mount,
  where he worshiped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with
  his coat rent, and earth upon his head;
  </span><verse>33</verse><span>unto whom David said:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>
    If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me;
    </span><verse>34</verse><span>but if thou return to the city, and say unto
    Absalom, “I will be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father’s
    servant hitherto, so will I now also be thy servant;” then mayest thou for
    me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.
    </span><verse>35</verse><span>And hast
    thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? Therefore it
    shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king’s house,
    thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.
    </span><verse>36</verse><span>Behold, they
    have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok’s son, and Jonathan
    Abiathar’s son; and by them ye shall send unto me everything that ye can

 <chapter>16

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold, Ziba the
  servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and
  upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and a hundred bunches of raisins,
  and a hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>And the king said unto Ziba, “What meanest thou by these?”
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  And Ziba
  said:</span><quote><span>
   The asses be for the king’s household to ride on; and the bread and summer
   fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as be faint in the
   wilderness may drink.
  </span></quote>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>And the king said, “And where is thy master’s son?”</span></block>

   Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem; for he said, “Today shall the house of

 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Then said the king to Ziba, “Behold, thine are all that pertained unto

   I humbly beseech thee that I may find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king.

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of
  the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera;
  he came forth, and cursed still as he came.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David, and
  all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his
  left.

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>And thus said Shimei when he cursed:</span><quote><span>
   Come out, come out, thou bloody man, and thou man of Belial;
   </span><verse>8</verse><span>the LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood
   of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath

  <verse>9</verse><span>Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king:</span><quote><span>
   Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over, I pray

 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>And the king said:</span><quote><span>
   What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? So let him curse, because

   the LORD hath bidden him.
   </span><verse>12</verse><span>It may be that the

 <heading><span>Ahithophel and Hushai counsel David
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem,
  and Ahithophel with him.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David’s friend, was come
  unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, “God save the king, God
  save the king.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>And Absalom said to Hushai:</span><quote><span>
   Is this thy kindness to thy friend? Why wentest thou not with thy friend?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>And Hushai said unto Absalom:</span><quote><span>
   Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel,
   choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide.
   </span><verse>19</verse><span>And again, whom should I serve? Should I not
   serve in the presence of his son? As I have served in thy father’s
   presence, so will I be in thy presence.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, “Give counsel among you what we shall

 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>And Ahithophel said unto Absalom:</span><quote><span>
   Go in unto thy father’s concubines, which he hath left to keep the house;
   and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father; then shall
   the hands of all that are with thee be strong.

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom
  went in unto his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel.
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counseled in those days, was as
  if a man had inquired at the oracle of God; so was all the counsel of
  Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.
 </span></block>

 <chapter>17
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom:</span><quote><span>
   Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue
   after David this night;
   </span><verse>2</verse><span>and I will come upon
   him while he is weary and weakhanded, and will make him afraid; and all
   the people that are with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only;
   </span><verse>3</verse><span>and I will bring back all the people unto thee;
   the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned; so all the people shall
   be in peace.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.

 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him,

   Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner; shall we do after his saying? If
   not, speak thou.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>And Hushai said unto Absalom:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>
    The counsel that Ahithophel hath given is not good at this time.
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and
    his men, that they be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a
    bear robbed of her whelps in the field; and thy father is a man of war,
    and will not lodge with the people.
    </span><verse>9</verse><span>Behold, he
    is hid now in some pit, or in some other place; and it will come to pass,
    when some of them be overthrown at the first, that whosoever heareth it
    will say, “There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom.”
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as
    the heart of a lion, shall utterly melt; for all Israel knoweth that thy
    father is a mighty man, and they which be with him are valiant men.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>11</verse><span>Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee,
    from Dan even to Beer-Sheba, as the sand that is by the sea for
    multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person.
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we
    will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground; and of him and of
    all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one.
    </span><verse>13</verse><span>Moreover, if
    he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city,
    and we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small stone
    found there.

  <verse>14</verse><span>And Absalom and all the men of Israel said:</span><quote><span>
   The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of

   Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom.

 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests:</span><quote><span>
   Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and

  <verse>17</verse><span>Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by En-Rogel; for they might not be seen

  </span><verse>18</verse><span>Nevertheless, a lad saw them, and told Absalom; but they went both of
  them away quickly, and came to a man’s house in Bahurim, which had a

  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And the woman took and spread a covering over the well’s mouth, and
  spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known.

  “Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan?” And the woman said unto them, “They be

  <verse>23</verse><span>And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled

  the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of
  twenty thousand men.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>For the battle was there
  scattered over the face of all the country; and the wood devoured more
  people that day than the sword devoured.

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule,
  and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head
  caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the
  earth; and the mule that was under him went away.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said:
  </span><quote><span>Behold, I saw
  Absalom hanged in an oak.</span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>And Joab said unto the man that told him:</span><quote><span>
   And, behold, thou sawest him, and why didst thou not smite him there to

    <superscript><span>b</span></superscript><span>25 lb or 12 kg</span></note><span>thousand shekels of
    silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine hand against the
    king’s son; for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and
    Ittai, saying, “Beware that none touch the young man Absalom.”
   </span><verse>13</verse><span>Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood
   against mine own life; for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou
   thyself wouldest have set thyself against me.
  </span></quote>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>Then said Joab:</span><quote><span>
   I may not tarry thus with thee.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of
  Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>And ten young men that bare Joab’s armor
  compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people
  returned from pursuing after Israel; for Joab held back the people.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And they took Absalom, and cast him into a
  great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him; and
  all Israel fled everyone to his tent.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a
  pillar, which is in the king’s dale; for he said, “I have no son to keep
  my name in remembrance;” and he called the pillar after his own name;
  and it is called unto this day, Absalom’s place.

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok:</span><quote><span>
   Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged

 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>And Joab said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another
   day; but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king’s son is
   dead.

  <verse>21</verse><span>Then said Joab to Cushi, “Go tell the king what thou hast seen.” And
  Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.

  <verse>22</verse><span>Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, “But howsoever,
  let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi.” And Joab said, “Wherefore
  wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready?”
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>“But howsoever,” said he, “let me run.” And he said unto him, “Run.”
  Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>And David sat between the two gates; and the watchman went up to the
  roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked,
  and behold a man running alone.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, “If he be
  alone, there is tidings in his mouth.” And he came apace, and drew
  near.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>26</verse><span>And the watchman saw another man running; and the watchman called unto
  the porter, and said, “Behold another man running alone.” And the king
  said, “He also bringeth tidings.”
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>And the watchman said, “Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like
  the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok.” And the king said, “He is a
  good man, and cometh with good tidings.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>28</verse><span>And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, “All is well.” And he fell
  down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said:</span><quote><span>

  <verse>29</verse><span>And the king said:</span><quote><span>

  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>30</verse><span>And the king said unto him, “Turn aside, and stand here.” And he turned

  </span><verse>31</verse><span>And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, “Tidings, my lord the king;

  </span><verse>32</verse><span>And the king said unto Cushi, “Is the young man Absalom safe?” And
  Cushi answered, “The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise

 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>33</verse><span>And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate,

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And it was told Joab, “Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth for

  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people;
  for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as people
  being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud

   O my son Absalom! O Absalom, my son, my son!
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>And Joab came into the house to the king, and said:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>
    Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, which this day
    have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and
    the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines;
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>in that thou lovest thine enemies, and hatest
    thy friends. For thou hast declared this day, that thou regardest neither
    princes nor servants; for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived,
    and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>7</verse><span>Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy servants;
    for I swear by the LORD, if thou go not forth, there will not tarry one
    with thee this night; and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil
    that befell thee from thy youth until now.</span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all the
  people, saying, “Behold, the king doth sit in the gate.” And all the
  people came before the king; for Israel had fled every man to his tent.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel,
  saying:</span><quote><span>
   The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and he delivered us out

   Absalom.
   </span><verse>10</verse><span>And Absalom, whom we anointed over

    </span><verse>12</verse><span>Ye are my brethren,

  <verse>14</verse><span>And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the heart of

  And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over

   Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do thou remember that

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said:</span><quote><span>
   Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD’s

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>And David said:</span><quote><span>
   What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be

   We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse;
   every man to his tents, O Israel.

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>So every man of Israel went up from after David, and followed Sheba the

  <verse>3</verse><span>And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten

  brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite;
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>and he delivered them into the hands of the
  Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the hill before the LORD; and they
  fell all seven together, and were put to death in the days of harvest, in
  the first days, in the beginning of barley harvest.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her
  upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water dropped upon
  them out of heaven, and suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on
  them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine
  of Saul, had done.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his
  son from the men of Jabesh-Gilead, which had stolen them from the street
  of Beth-Shan, where the Philistines had hanged them, when the
  Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa;
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>and he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of
  Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that were
  hanged.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the country
  of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulcher of Kish his father; and they
  performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was entreated
  for the land.

  War against the Philistines

  <verse>15</verse><span>Moreover the Philistines had yet war again
  with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought
  against the Philistines; and David waxed faint.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And Ishbi- benob, which was of the sons of the

  </span><verse>17</verse><span>But Abishai the

  Then the men of David sware unto him, saying:

   Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench not the

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle with the
  Philistines at Gob; then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph, which was
  of the sons of the giant.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan
  the son of Jaare-Oregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the brother of Goliath the
  Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of great stature,
  that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and
  twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimeah the brother of

  A song of David

 <chapter>22
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song, in the day that
  the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out
  of the hand of Saul;
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>and he said:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>
    The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;
    </span><verse>3</verse><span>the God of my rock; in him will I trust; he is
    my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my
    savior; thou savest me from violence.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>4</verse><span>I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised; so shall I be
    saved from mine enemies.
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men made me
    afraid;
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>the sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented
    me.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>7</verse><span>In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God; and he did
    hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry did enter into his ears.
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and
    shook, because he was wroth.
    </span><verse>9</verse><span>There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth
    devoured; coals were kindled by it.
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>He bowed the heavens also, and came down, and darkness was under his
    feet.
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly; and he was seen upon the wings
    of the wind.
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, and thick
    clouds of the skies.
    </span><verse>13</verse><span>Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>14</verse><span>The LORD thundered from heaven, and the Most High uttered his voice.
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited
    them.
    </span><verse>16</verse><span>And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were
    discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of
    his nostrils.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>17</verse><span>He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;
    </span><verse>18</verse><span>he delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated me; for
    they were too strong for me.
    </span><verse>19</verse><span>They prevented me in the day of my calamity; but the LORD was my stay.
    </span><verse>20</verse><span>He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because
    he delighted in me.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>21</verse><span>The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the
    cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.
    </span><verse>22</verse><span>For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed
    from my God.
    </span><verse>23</verse><span>For all his judgments were before me; and as for his statutes, I did
    not depart from them.
    </span><verse>24</verse><span>I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine iniquity.
    </span><verse>25</verse><span>Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my righteousness;
    according to my cleanness in his eyesight.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>26</verse><span>With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful, and with the upright
    man thou wilt show thyself upright.
    </span><verse>27</verse><span>With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure; and with the froward thou
    wilt show thyself unsavory.
    </span><verse>28</verse><span>And the afflicted people thou wilt save; but thine eyes are upon the
    haughty, that thou mayest bring them down.
    </span><verse>29</verse><span>For thou art my lamp, O Lord; and the LORD will lighten my darkness.
    </span><verse>30</verse><span>For by thee I have run through a troop; by my God have I leaped over a
    wall.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>31</verse><span>As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is tried; he is a
    buckler to all them that trust in him.
    </span><verse>32</verse><span>For who is God, save the LORD? And who is a rock, save our God?
    </span><verse>33</verse><span>God is my strength and power; and he maketh my way perfect.
    </span><verse>34</verse><span>He maketh my feet like hinds’ feet; and setteth me upon my high places.
    </span><verse>35</verse><span>He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by mine
    arms.
    </span><verse>36</verse><span>Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation; and thy gentleness
    hath made me great.
    </span><verse>37</verse><span>Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not
    slip.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>38</verse><span>I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again
    until I had consumed them.
    </span><verse>39</verse><span>And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise;
    yea, they are fallen under my feet.
    </span><verse>40</verse><span>For thou hast girded me with strength to battle; them that rose up
    against me hast thou subdued under me.
    </span><verse>41</verse><span>Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies,
    that I might destroy them that hate me.
    </span><verse>42</verse><span>They looked, but there was none to save; even
    unto the LORD, but he answered them not.
    </span><verse>43</verse><span>Then
    did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth; I did stamp them as the
    mire of the street, and did spread them abroad.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>44</verse><span>Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, thou hast
    kept me to be head of the heathen; a people which I knew not shall serve
    me.
    </span><verse>45</verse><span>Strangers shall submit themselves unto me; as soon as they hear, they
    shall be obedient unto me.
    </span><verse>46</verse><span>Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their close

    from the violent man.
    </span><verse>50</verse><span>Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the heathen, and

  David’s last words
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>23
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Now these be the last words of David. David the son of Jesse said, and
  the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and
  the sweet psalmist of Israel, said:</span><quote>
   <block>
    <verse>2</verse><span>The Spirit of the LORD spake by me, and his word was in my tongue.
    </span><verse>3</verse><span>The God of
    Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, “He that ruleth over men must
    be just, ruling in the fear of God.
    </span><verse>4</verse><span>And he
    shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, even a morning
    without clouds; as the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear
    shining after rain.”
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>5</verse><span>Although my house be not so with God; yet he hath made with me an
    everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure; for this is all
    my salvation, and all my desire, although he make it not to grow.
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>But the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust away,
    because they cannot be taken with hands;
    </span><verse>7</verse><span>but the man that shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the
    staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same
    place.</span></block>

  </quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: the Tachmonite
  that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same was Adino the
  Eznite; he lifted up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at
  one time.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three
  mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines that were there
  gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his
  hand clave unto the sword; and the LORD wrought a great victory that
  day; and the people returned after him only to spoil.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the
  Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of
  ground full of lentiles; and the people fled from the Philistines.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and slew the
  Philistines; and the LORD wrought a great victory.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the
  harvesttime unto the cave of Adullam; and the troop of the Philistines
  pitched in the valley of Rephaim.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And David was then in a hold, and the garrison of the Philistines was
  then in Bethlehem.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>And David longed, and said, “Oh that one would give me drink of the
  water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!”
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And the three mighty men brake through the host of
  the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by
  the gate, and took it, and brought it to David; nevertheless he would not
  drink thereof, but poured it out unto the LORD.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And he said, “Be it far from me, O Lord, that
  I should do this; is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy
  of their lives?” Therefore he would not drink it. These things did these
  three mighty men.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief among
  three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred, and slew them,
  and had the name among three.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>Was he not most honorable of three? Therefore he was their captain;
  howbeit he attained not unto the first three.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel,
  who had done many acts, he slew two lion-like men of Moab; he went down
  also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man; and the Egyptian had a spear in
  his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear
  out of the Egyptian’s hand, and slew him with his own spear.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among
  three mighty men.
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>He was more honorable than the thirty, but he attained not to the first
  three. And David set him over his guard.

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he
  moved David against them to say, “Go, number Israel and Judah.”
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which was with
  him:</span><quote><span>
   Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba, and
   number ye the people, that I may know the number of the people.

   doth my lord the king delight in this thing?
  </span></quote>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Notwithstanding the king’s word prevailed against Joab, and against the

  from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of
  the city that lieth in the midst of the river of Gad, and toward Jazer;
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim-Hodshi; and they
  came to Dan-Jaan, and about to Zidon,
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>and came to the stronghold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the
  Hivites, and of the Canaanites; and they went out to the south of Judah,
  even to Beer-Sheba.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at
  the end of nine months and twenty days.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king; and
  there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the
  sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And David’s heart smote him after that he had numbered the people. And
  David said unto the LORD:</span><quote><span>
   I have sinned greatly in that I have done; and now, I beseech thee, O
   Lord, take away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very
   foolishly.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD came unto
  the prophet Gad, David’s seer, saying:</span><quote>
   <verse>12</verse><span>Go and say unto David, “Thus saith the LORD: I offer thee three things;
   choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.”</span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? Or wilt thou flee
   three months before thine enemies, while they pursue thee? Or that there
   be three days’ pestilence in thy land? Now advise, and see what answer I
   shall return to him that sent me.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>And David said unto Gad:</span><quote><span>
   I am in a great strait; let us fall now into the hand of the LORD; for his
   mercies are great; and let me not fall into the hand of man.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from
  the morning even to the time appointed; and there died of the people from
  Dan even to Beer-Sheba seventy thousand men.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And when the angel stretched out his hand upon
  Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD
  </span><under>
   <note><span>repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people. “It is enough: stay now thine hand”</span></note><span>said unto him, “Stay now thine hand, it is enough;” for the people
   repented, and the Lord stayed the hand of the angel, that he destroyed not the
   people</span></under><span>. And the angel of the LORD was by the threshing floor of Araunah, the
   Jebusite.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>For David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote the
  people, and said:
  </span><quote><span>Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly; but these
  sheep, what have they done? Let thine hand, I pray thee, be against me,

  David builds an altar
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   Go up, rear an altar unto the LORD in the threshing floor of Araunah the
   Jebusite.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD
  commanded.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And
  Arunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him; and
  Arunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the
  ground.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>And Arunah said:
  </span><quote><span>
   Wherefore is my Lord the king come to his servant?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And David said:
  </span><quote><span>
   To buy the threshing floor of thee, to build an altar unto the LORD, that
   the plague may be stayed from the people.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>And Araunah said unto David:</span><quote><span>
   Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him; behold,
   here be oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other
   instruments of the oxen for wood.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>All these things did Arunah, as a king, give unto the king. And Araunah
  said unto the king:</span><quote><span>
   The LORD thy God accept thee.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>And the king said unto Arunah:</span><quote><span>
   Nay; but I will surely buy it of thee at a price; neither will I offer
   burnt offerings unto the LORD my God of that which doth cost me nothing.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of
  silver.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>And David built there an altar unto
  the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the LORD was
  entreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.
