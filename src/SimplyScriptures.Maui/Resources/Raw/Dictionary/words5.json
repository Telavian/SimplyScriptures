It is pronounced with an expiration of breath, which, preceding a vowel, is perceptible by the ear at a considerable distance.  Thus, harm and arm, hear and ear, heat and eat, are distinguished at almost any distance at which the voice can be heard.  H is a letter sui generis, but as useful in forming and distinguishing words as any other.\nIn our mother tongue, the Anglo-Saxon, and other Teutonic dialects, h sometimes represents the L. c, and the Gr.x; as in horn, L. cornu, Gr. to hide; G. haut, Sw. hud, D. huid, Dan.hud, L. cutis; Sax. hlinian, L. clino, Gr. to lean; L. celo, to conceal, Sax. helan. G. hehlen, Dan. haeler.  In Latin h sometimes represents the Greek x; as in halo, Gr. hio.  In the modern European languages, it represents other guttural letters.\nIn English, h is sometimes mute, as in honor, honest; also when united with g, as in right, fight, brought.

Heat, as a cause of sensation, that is, the matter of heat, is considered to be a subtil fluid, contained in a greater or less degree in all bodies.  In modern chimistry, it is called caloric.  It expands all bodies in different proportions, and is the cause of fluidity and evaporation.  A certain degree of it is also essential to animal and vegetable life.  Heat is latent, when so combined with other matter as not to be perceptible.  It is sensible, when it is evolved and perceptible.\n2.  Heat, as a sensation, is the effect produced on the sentient organs of animals, by the passage of caloric, disengaged from surrounding bodies, to the organs.  When we touch or approach a hot body, the caloric or heat passes from that body to our organs of feeling, and gives the sensation of heat.  On the contrary, when we touch a cold body, the caloric passes from the hand to that body, and causes a sensation of cold.\nNote.  This theory of heat seems not to be fully settled.\n3.  Hot air; hot weather; as the heat of the tropical climates.\n4.

Moisture; but the word is chiefly used to express the moisture or fluids of animal bodies, as the humors of the eye.  But more generally the word is used to express a fluid in its morbid or vitiated state.  Hence, in popular speech, we often hear it said,the blood is full of humors.  But the expression is not technical nor correct.\nAqueous humor of the eye, a transparent fluid, occupying the space between the crystalline lens and the cornea, both before and behind the pupil.\nCrystalline humor or lens, a small transparent solid body, of a softish consistence, occupying a middle position in the eye, between the aqueous and vitreous humors, and directly behind the pupil.  It is of a lenticular form, or with double convex surfaces, and is the principal instrument in refracting the rays of light, so as to form an image on the retina.\nVitreous humor of the eye, a fluid contained in the minute cells of a transparent membrane, occupying the greater part of the cavity of the eye, and all the space between the crystalline and the retina.\n2.  A disease of the skin; cutaneous eruptions.\n3. Turn of mind; temper; disposition, or rather a peculiarity of disposition often temporary; so called because the temper of mind has been supposed to depend on the fluids of the body.  Hence we say, good humor; melancholy humor; peevish humor.  Such humors, when temporary, we call freaks, whims, caprice.  Thus a person characterized by good nature may have a fit of ill humor; and an ill natured person may have a fit of good humor. So we say, it was the humor of the man at the time; it was the humor of the multitude.\n4.  That quality of the imagination which gives to ideas a wild or fantastic turn, and tends to excite laughter or mirth by ludicrous images or representations. Humor is less poignant and brilliant than wit; hence it is always agreeable. Wit,directed against folly, often offends by its severity; humor makes a man ashamed of his follies, without exciting his resentment. Humor may be employed solely to raise mirth and render conversation pleasant, or it may contain a delicate kind of satire. \n5.  Petulance; peevishness; better expressed by ill humor.\n Is my friend all perfection? has he not humors to be endured?\n6.  A trick; a practice or habit.\n I like not the humor of lying.\nHU\u0027MOR, v.t.  To gratify by yielding to particular inclination, humor,wish or desire; to indulge by compliance. We sometimes humor children to their injury or ruin.  The sick,the infirm, and the aged often require to be humored.\n1.

We receive it through the Latin and Greek from the Shemitic jod,je, or ye, in Greek iwra,whence our English word jot.  The vowel in French, and in most European languages, has the long fine sound which we express by e in me, or ee in seen, meek.  This sound we retain in some foreign words which are naturalized in our language, as in machine, intrigue.  But in most English words this long sound is shortened, as in holiness, pity, gift; in which words the sound of i coincides with that of y in hypocrite,cycle,and at the end of words, in unaccented syllables, as in holy, glory.  It is this short sound of the French and Italian i, which we hear in the pronunciation of been, which we pronounce bin.  After l, this letter has sometimes the liquid sound of y, as in million, pronounced milyon.  This sound corresponds with that of the Hebrews, as in Joseph, which in Syria is pronounced Yoseph,and with the sound of the German j, as in ja, jahr, that is ya, yahr.\nThe sound of i long, as in fine, kind, arise, is diphthongal; it begins with a sound approaching that of broad a, but it is not exactly the same, as the organs are not opened to the same extent, and therefore the sound begins a little above that of aw.  The sound, if continued,closes with one that nearly approaches to that of e long.  This sound can be learned only by the ear.  This letter enters into several digraphs, as in fail, field,seize, feign, vein, friend; and with o in oil,join, coin,it helps to form a proper diphthong.\nNo English word ends with i, but when the sound of the letter occurs at the end of a word,it is expressed by y.\nAs a numeral I signifies one, and stands for as many units as it is repeated in times, as II, two, III, three, \u0026c.  When it stands before V or X, it subtracts itself,and the numerals denote one less than the V or the X.  Thus IV expresses four, one less than V, five; IX stands for nine, one less than X, ten.  But when it is placed after V or X, it denotes the addition of an unit, or as many units as the letter is repeated in times.  Thus VI is five and one, or six, and XI is ten and one, or eleven; VIII stands for five and three, or eight, \u0026c.\nI, formerly prefixed to some English words, as in ibuilt, is a contraction of the Saxon prefix ge; and more generally this was written y.\nI, pron. [L. ego.]  The pronoun of the first person; the word which expresses one\u0027s self, or that by which a speaker or writer denotes himself.  It is only the nominative case of the pronoun; in the other cases we use me.  I am attached to study; study delights me.  We often hear in popular language the phrase it is me, which is now considered to be ungrammatical, for it is I.  But the phrase may have come down to us from the use of the Welsh mi, or from the French use of the phrase, c\u0027est moi.\nIn the plural, we use we, and us, which appear to be words radically distinct from I.  \nJohnson observes that Shakespeare uses I for ay or yes.  In this he is not followed, and the use is incorrect."},{"Word":"Iambic","Definition":"IAM\u0027BIC, n.

He is ill able to sustain the burden.\n Ill bears the sex the youthful lovers\u0027 fate,\n When just approaching to the nuptial state.\nILL, prefixed to participles of the present tense, and denoting evil or wrong, may be considered as a noun governed by the participle, or as making a part of a compound word; as an ill meaning man, an ill designing man, an ill boding hour; that is, a man meaning ill, an hour boding ill.  It is more consonant, however, to the genius of our language, to treat these and similar words as compounds.  In some cases, as before the participles of intransitive verbs, ill must be considered as a part of the compound, as in ill-looking.  When used before the perfect participle, ill is to be considered as an adverb, or modifying word, or to be treated as a part of the compound; as in ill-bred, ill-governed, ill-fated, ill-favored, ill-formed, ill-minded.  In these and all similar connections, it might be well to unite the two words in a compound by a hyphen.  As ill may be prefixed to almost any participle, it is needless to attempt to collect a list of such words for insertion."},{"Word":"Ill-bred","Definition":"ILL-BRED, a.
