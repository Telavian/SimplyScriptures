A firm hard substance of a dull white color, composing some part of the frame of an animal body.  The bones of an animal support all the softer parts, as the flesh and vessels.  They vary in texture in different bones, and in different parts of the same bone.  The long bones are compact in their middle portion, with a central cavity occupied by a network of plates and fibers, and cellular or spongy at the extremities.  The flat bones are compact externally, and cellular internally. The bones in a fetus are soft and cartilaginous, but they gradually harden with age. The ends of the long bones are larger than the middle, which renders the articulations more firm, and in the fetus are distinct portions, called epiphyses.  Bones are supplied with blood vessels, and in the fetus, or in a diseased state, are very vascular.  They are probably also furnished with nerves and absorbents, though less easily detected in a sound state.  They are covered with a thin, strong membrane, called the periosteum, which, together with the bones, has very little sensibility in a sound state, but when inflamed, is extremely sensible.  Their cells and cavities are occupied by a fatty substance, called the medulla or marrow.  They consist of earthy matter, rather more than half, gelatin, one sixteenth, and cartilage, about one third of the whole.  The earthy matter gives them their solidity, and consists of phosphate of lime, with a small portion of carbonate of lime and phosphate of magnesia. \n2.

[L.parcus, saving.]  Originally, a fortified city or town; hence a hill, for hills were selected for places of defense. But in later times, the term city was substituted to denote an episcopal town, in which was the see of a bishop, and that of borough was retained for the rest.  At present, the name is given appropriately to such towns and villages as send representatives or burgesses to Parliament.  Some boroughs are incorporated, other are not.\nBOROUGH, n.  bur\u0027ro.  In Saxon times, a main pledge, or association of men, who were sureties or free pledges to the king for the good behavior of each other, and if any offense was committed in their district, they were bound to have the offender forthcoming. The association of ten men was called a tithing, or decenary; the presiding man was called the tithing man, or head-borough; or in some places, borsholder, borough\u0027s elder.  This society was called also friburg, free burg, frank pledge.  Ten tithings formed a hundred, consisting of that number of sureties, and this denomination is still given to the districts, comprehended in the association. The term seems to have been used both for the society and for each surety. The word main, hand, which is attached to this society, or their mutual assurance, indicates that the agreement was ratified by shaking hands.\nSome writers have suggested that the application of this word to towns sprung from these associations, and of course was posterior to them in time.  But the word was used for a town or castle in other nations, and in Asia, doubtless long before the origin of the frank pledge.\nIn Connecticut, this word, borough, is used for a town or a part of a town, or a village, incorporated with certain privileges, distinct from those of other towns and of cities; as the Borough of Bridgeport.\nIn Scotland, a borough is a body corporate, consisting of the inhabitants of a certain district,erected by the Sovereign, with a certain jurisdiction.\nBoroughs are erected to be held of the sovereign, as is generally the case of royal boroughs; or of the superior of the lands included, as in the case of boroughs of regality and barony.

It bears a middle place in pronunciation, between the aspirate, and the palatal.  It is a Roman character, borrowed from the Gr.x, or from the oriental, which was used in languages written from right to left, and when inverted and the corners rounded, becomes C.  In the old Etruscan, it was written with the corners rounded, but not inverted; in Arcadian, C, as now written.  That its sound in Latin was the same, or nearly the same, as that of kappa, may be known from the fact, that the Greeks, while the Latin was a living language, wrote kappa for the Roman C.  Perhaps the same character may be the basis of the Arabic.\nAs an abbreviature, C stands for Caius, Carolus, Caesar, condemno, \u0026c., and CC for consulibus.  As a numeral C stands for 100; CC for 200; \u0026c.  In music, C after the cliff, is the mark of common time. \nIn English, C has two sounds, or rather it represents two very different articulations of the organs; one close, like K, which occurs before a, o and u; the other, a sibilant, precisely like s, which occurs before E, I and Y.

It is precisely equivalent to the Latin com, in comparo, compono, and the Latin com, in composition, may be the Celtic comh or cym.  But generally it seems to be con, changed into com.  Ainsworth deduces cum from the Greek; for originally it was written cyn.  But this is probably a mistake.\nCon coincides in radical letters and in signification with the Teutonic gain, gen, gean, igen, igien, in the English again, against; Sax. Gean, ongean; sw. Igen; Dan. Igien.  Whatever may be its origin or affinities, the primary sense of the word is probably from some root that signifies to meet or oppose, or turn and meet; to approach to, or to be with.  This is the radical sense of most propositions of the like import.  See the English with, again.  So in Irish, coinne, a meeting; as coinne, opposite.\nCon, in compounds, is change into l before l, as in colligo, to collect, and into m before a labial, as in comparo, to compare.  Before a vowel or h, the na is dropped; as in coalesco, to coalesce, to cooperate; cohibeo, to restrain.  I denotes union, as in conjoin; or opposition, as in conflict, contend.\nCON, [abbreviated from Latin contra, against.] In the phrase, pro and con, for and against, con denotes the negative side of a question.
