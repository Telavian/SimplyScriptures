    <verse>18</verse><span>Now,
    </span><dunder><span>as it is written</span></dunder><span>, the birth of
    Jesus Christ was on this wise. After his mother, Mary, was espoused to
    Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy
    Ghost.
    </span><verse>19</verse><span>Then Joseph, her husband, being a just
    man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her
    away privily.
    </span><verse>20</verse><span>But while he thought on these
    things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a vision,
    saying:
    </span><quote><span>
     Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife; for
     that which is conceived in her, is of the Holy Ghost.
     </span><verse>21</verse><span>And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt
     call his name Jesus; for he shall save his people from their sins.

    <verse>7</verse><span>Then Herod, when he had called the wise men privily, inquired of them
    diligently what time the star appeared.
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, “Go and search diligently for
    the young child; and when ye have found the child, bring me word again,
    that I may come and worship him also.”

   <block>
    <verse>9</verse><span>When they had heard the king, they departed; and lo, the star which
    they saw in the east, went before them, until it came and stood over
    where the young child was.
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child, with
    Mary his mother, and fell down and worshiped him. And when they had
    opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts: gold, and
    frankincense, and myrrh.
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to
    Herod, they departed into their own country another way.

   Commandments on what to teach

   <dunder><span>
    Now these are the words which Jesus taught his disciples that they should
    say unto the people:</span></dunder>
   <quote>
    <block>
     <verse>1</verse><span>Judge not
     </span><dunder><span>unrightously</span></dunder><span>, that ye be not judged;
     </span><dunder><span>but judge righteous judgment</span></dunder><span>.
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>For
     with what judgment ye shall judge, ye shall be judged; and with what
     measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.</span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>3</verse><span>And again, ye shall say unto them, “Why is it
     that thou beholdest the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but considerest
     not the beam that is in thine own eye?”
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>Or how
     wilt thou say to thy brother, “Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye;”
     and
     </span><dunder><span>canst not</span></dunder><span>
     behold a beam in thine own eye?</span></block>

   </quote>
  </block>

  <block>
   <dunder><span>And Jesus said unto his disciples:</span></dunder>
   <quote>
    <block>
     <dunder><span>Beholdest thou the Scribes, and the Pharisees, and the priests, and the
     Levites? They teach in their synagogues, but do not
     observe the law, nor the commandments; and all have
     gone out of the way, and are under sin. Go thou and say unto them, “Why
     teach ye men the law and the commandments, when ye
     yourselves are the children of corruption?”
      </span><verse>5</verse><span>Say unto them,</span><dunder><span>
       “Ye hypocrites, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then
       shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother’s
       eye.”</span></dunder>
     </dunder>
    </block>

    <block>
     <dunder><span>Go ye into the world, saying unto all, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven
     has come nigh unto you.” And the mysteries of the
     kingdom ye shall keep within yourselves;</span></dunder>
     <verse>6</verse><under>
      <note><span>give not</span></note><span>for it is not meet to give</span></under><span>
     that which is holy unto the dogs; neither cast ye your pearls unto
     swine, lest they trample them under their feet.
     </span><dunder><span>For the world cannot receive that which ye,
     yourselves, are not able to bear; wherefore ye shall not give your pearls
     unto them, lest they</span></dunder><span>
     turn again and rend you.</span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>7</verse><dunder><span>Say unto them, “Ask of God;</span></dunder><span>
     ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and
     it shall be opened unto you.”
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>For every one that asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh, findeth; and
     unto him that knocketh, it shall be opened.</span></block>

   <dunder><span>
    And then said his disciples unto him:
   </span></dunder>
   <quote>
    <block>
     <dunder><span>They will say unto us, “We ourselves are righteous, and need not that any
     man should teach us. God, we know, heard Moses and
     some of the prophets; but us he will not hear.”</span></dunder>

    <block>

      And they will say, “We have the law for our salvation, and that is
      sufficient for us.”</span></dunder>

  <block>
   <dunder><span>Then Jesus answered, and said unto his disciples:</span></dunder>
   <quote>
    <block>
     <dunder><span>Thus shall ye say unto them: What man among you, having a son, and he
     shall be standing out, and shall say, “Father, open thy house that I may come in
     and sup with thee,” will not say, “Come in, my son; for mine is thine, and thine is
     mine”?</span></dunder>
     <verse>9</verse><span>Or what man is there among you, who, if his son
     ask bread, will give him a stone?
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>Or if he ask
     a fish, will he give him a serpent?
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>If ye then,
     being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more
     shall your Father who is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>Therefore, all things whatsoever ye would that
     men should do to you, do ye even so to them; for this is the law and the
     prophets.</span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>13</verse><dunder><span>Repent, therefore, and</span></dunder><span>
     enter ye in at the strait gate; for wide is the gate, and broad is the
     way that leadeth to destruction, and many there be who go in thereat.
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way that leadeth unto
     life, and few there be that find it.</span></block>

    </span><verse>16</verse><span>Ye shall know them by their fruits; for do men gather grapes of thorns,
    or figs of thistles?
    </span><verse>17</verse><span>Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree
    bringeth forth evil fruit.

    them into his vineyard.</span></block>

    </span><verse>7</verse><span>They said unto him, “Because no man hath hired us.” He said unto them,
    “Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right ye shall
    receive.”</span></block>

    <verse>8</verse><span>So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard said unto his steward,
    “Call the laborers and give them their hire, beginning from the last
    unto the first.”
    </span><verse>9</verse><span>And when they came that began about the eleventh hour, they received
    every man a penny.
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received
    more; and they likewise received every man a penny. </span><verse>11</verse><span>And when they had
    received a penny, they murmured against the good man of the house,

      reject me. I am the head of the corner. These Jews
      shall fall upon me, and shall be broken. And the kingdom of God shall
      be taken from them, and shall be given to a nation
      bringing forth the fruits thereof (meaning the
      Gentiles). Wherefore, on whomsoever this stone shall fall, it shall
      grind him to powder.</span></block>

     <block><span>
      And when the Lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, he will destroy those
      miserable, wicked men, and will let again his
      vineyard unto other husbandmen, even in the last days, who shall render him the fruits in their seasons.</span></block>

     <verse>2</verse><span>The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain
     king, who made a marriage for his son.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>And w</span><dunder><span>hen the marriage was ready, he</span></dunder><span>
     sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding; and
     they would not come.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>4</verse><span>Again he sent forth other servants, saying, “Tell them that are bidden,
     ‘Behold, I have prepared my oxen, and my fatlings have been killed, and
     my dinner is ready, and all things are prepared; therefore come unto the
     marriage.’”
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>But they made light of
     </span><under>
      <note><span>it</span></note><span>the servants</span></under><span>, and went their ways; one to his farm, another to his
      merchandise;
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>and the remnant took his servants,
     and entreated them spitefully, and slew them.
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>But when the king heard
     </span><under>
      <note><span>thereof</span></note><span>that his servants were dead</span></under><span>, he was wroth; and he sent forth his
      armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>8</verse><span>Then said he to his servants, “The wedding is ready; but they who were
     bidden were not worthy.
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to
     the marriage.”</span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>10</verse><span>So those servants went out into the highways,
     and gathered together all, as many as they found, both bad and good; and
     the wedding was furnished with guests.
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>But when
     the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man who had not a
     wedding garment.
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>And he said unto him, “Friend,
     how camest thou in hither, not having a wedding garment?” And he was
     speechless.
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>Then said the king unto his
     servants, “Bind him hand and foot, and take and cast him away into outer
     darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>For many are called, but few chosen;
     </span><dunder><span>wherefore all do not have on the wedding garment</span></dunder><span>.

     the beginning of the sorrows

     those days shall be shortened.

     not.
     </span><verse>24</verse><span>For
     in those days, there shall also arise false Christs, and false prophets,

     against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; there shall be famine and
     pestilences, and earthquakes in divers places.
     </span><dunder><span>And again, because iniquity shall abound, the love of men shall wax cold; but he that
     shall not be overcome, the same shall be saved</span></dunder><span>.</span></block>

     <verse>29</verse><span>And immediately after the tribulation of those

     then shall appear the sign of the Son of

     <verse>1</verse><span>And then</span><dunder><span>, at that day, before the Son of Man comes,</span></dunder><span>
     the kingdom of heaven shall be likened unto ten virgins, who took their
     lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>And five of them were wise, and five of them
     were foolish.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>They that were foolish took their

     are gone out.”
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>But the wise answered, saying, “Lest there be not enough for us and
     you, go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.”

     </span><dunder>
      <note><span>the kingdom of heaven</span></note><span>it</span></dunder><span>
     is like as a man traveling into a
     far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his
     goods.
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>And unto one he gave five talents, to
     another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and
     straightway went on his journey.</span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>16</verse><span>Then he that had received the five talents, went and traded with the
     same; and gained other five talents.
     </span><verse>17</verse><span>And likewise he who received two talents, he also gained other two.
     </span><verse>18</verse><span>But he who had received one, went and digged in the earth and hid his

    <block>
     <verse>19</verse><span>After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with

     so he that had received the five talents came, and brought other five
     talents, saying, “Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents; behold, I
     have gained besides them, five talents more.”
     </span><verse>21</verse><span>His lord said unto him, “Well done, good and
     faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make
     thee ruler over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy lord.”</span></block>

     <verse>22</verse><span>He also that had received two talents came and said, “Lord, thou

     things; enter thou into the joy of thy lord.”</span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>24</verse><span>Then he who had received the one talent came,
     and said, “Lord, I knew thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou
     hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not scattered.
     </span><verse>25</verse><span>And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent
     in the earth; and lo,
     </span><dunder><span>here is thy talent; take it from me as thou hast from thine other
     servants</span></dunder><span>, for it is thine.”
     </span><verse>26</verse><span>His lord answered and said
     unto him, “O wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I
     sowed not, and gather where I have not scattered.
     </span><verse>27</verse><dunder><span>Having known this</span></dunder><span>, therefore, thou
     oughtest to have put my money to the exchangers, and at my coming I should
     have received mine own with usury.
     </span><verse>28</verse><dunder><span>I wil</span></dunder><span>l take, therefore, the talent from
     </span><under>
      <note><span>him</span></note><span>you</span></under><span>, and give it
      unto him who hath ten talents.
     </span><verse>29</verse><span>For unto
     everyone who hath
     </span><dunder><span>obtained other talents,</span></dunder><span>
     shall be given, and he
     shall have in abundance. But from him that hath not
     </span><dunder><span>obtained other talents</span></dunder><span>, shall be taken away even that which he hath
     </span><dunder><span>received</span></dunder><span>.”
     </span><verse>30</verse><span>And
     </span><dunder><span>his lord shall say unto his servants,

   <verse>24</verse><span>When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing,
