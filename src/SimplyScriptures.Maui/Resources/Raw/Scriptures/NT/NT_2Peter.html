     <verse>1</verse><span>Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that
     have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of
     God and our Savior Jesus Christ;
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God,
     and of Jesus our Lord,
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that
     pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath
     called us to glory and virtue;
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises; that
     by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the
     corruption that is in the world through lust.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>5</verse><span>And besides this, giving all diligence,
     </span><dot><span>add to your faith virtue;</span></dot>
     <dot><span>and to virtue, knowledge;</span></dot>
     <dot>
      <verse>6</verse><span>and to knowledge, temperance;</span></dot>
     <dot><span>and to temperance, patience;</span></dot>
     <dot><span>and to patience, godliness;</span></dot>
     <dot>
      <verse>7</verse><span>And to godliness, brotherly kindness;</span></dot>
     <dot><span>and to brotherly kindness, charity.</span></dot>

     <verse>8</verse><span>For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall
     neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
     Christ.
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and
     hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and
     election sure; for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall;
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the
     everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>12</verse><span>Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of
     these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present
     truth.
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you
     up by putting you in remembrance;
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our
     Lord Jesus Christ hath showed me.
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>Moreover I will endeavor that ye may be able after my decease to have
     these things always in remembrance.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>16</verse><span>For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known
     unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were
     eyewitnesses of his majesty.
     </span><verse>17</verse><span>For he received from God the Father honor and glory, when there came
     such a voice to him from the excellent glory, “This is my beloved Son,
     in whom I am well pleased.”
     </span><verse>18</verse><span>And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him
     in the holy mount.
     </span><verse>19</verse><span>We have therefore a more sure knowledge of the word of prophecy, to
     which word of prophecy ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light
     which shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star
     arise in your hearts;
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>20</verse><span>Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scriptures is given of any
     private will of man.
     </span><verse>21</verse><span>For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man; but holy men
     of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.

     False teachers

    <chapter>2
    </chapter>

    <block>
     <verse>1</verse><span>But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there
     shall be false teachers among you who privily shall bring in abominable
     heresies, even denying the Lord that
     bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by
     reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>And through covetousness shall they with feigned
     words make merchandise of you; whose judgment now of a long time lingereth
     not, and their destruction slumbereth not.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>4</verse><span>For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to
     hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto
     judgment;
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>and spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a
     preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the
     ungodly;
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes condemned them
     with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after should
     live ungodly;
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>and delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the
     wicked;
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>(for that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing,
     vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds;)
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>the Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptation, and to
     reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished;
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>but chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness,
     and despise government. Presumptuous are they, self-willed, they are not
     afraid to speak evil of dignities.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>11</verse><span>Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing
     accusation against them before the Lord.
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>But these, as natural brute beasts made to be taken and destroyed,
     speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly
     perish in their own corruption;
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>and shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it
     pleasure to riot in the daytime. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting
     themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling
     unstable souls; a heart they have exercised with covetous practices;
     cursed children;
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the
     way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;
     </span><verse>16</verse><span>but was rebuked for his iniquity; the dumb ass speaking with man’s
     voice forbade the madness of the prophet.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>17</verse><span>These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest;
     to whom the mist of darkness is reserved forever.
     </span><verse>18</verse><span>For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through
     the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean
     escaped from them who live in error.
     </span><verse>19</verse><span>While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of
     corruption; for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought
     into bondage.
     </span><verse>20</verse><span>For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the
     knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled
     therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the
     beginning.
     </span><verse>21</verse><span>For it had been better for them not to have known the way of
     righteousness, than, after they had known it, to turn from the holy
     commandment delivered unto them.
     </span><verse>22</verse><span>But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb:</span><quote>
      <reference>
       <referencenote><span>Proverbs 26:11</span></referencenote><span>The dog is turned to his own vomit again;</span></reference>

     The coming of the Lord
    </span></heading>

    <chapter>3
    </chapter>

    <block>
     <verse>1</verse><span>This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in which I stir up
     your pure minds by way of remembrance;
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>that ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the
     holy prophets, and of the commandments of us, the apostles of the Lord
     and Savior;
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>3</verse><span>Knowing this first, that in the last days there shall come scoffers,
     walking after their own lusts.
     </span><verse>4</verse><dunder><span>Denying the Lord Jesus Christ</span></dunder><span>, and saying, “Where is the promise of his coming? For since the
     fathers fell asleep, all things must continue as they are, and have
     continued as
     they are from the beginning of the creation.”
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>For this they willingly are ignorant of, that of
     old the heavens, and the earth standing in the water and out of the water,
     were created by the word of God;
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>and by the word
     of God, the world that then was, being overflowed with water perished;
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>but the heavens, and the earth which are now,
     are kept in store by the same word, reserved unto fire against the day of
     judgment and perdition of ungodly men.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>8</verse><span>But
     </span><dunder><span>concerning the coming of the Lord</span></dunder><span>,
     beloved, I would not have you ignorant of this one thing, that one day is
     with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>The Lord is not slack concerning his promise and
     coming, as some men count slackness; but long-suffering toward us, not
     willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in
     the night, in the which the heavens shall
     </span><under>
      <note><span>pass away with a great noise</span></note><span>shake, and the earth also shall tremble, and the mountains shall melt, and pass away with a great noise</span></under><span>, and the elements
      shall be filled with fervent heat; the earth also shall be filled, and the
      corruptible works which are therein shall be burned up.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>11</verse><span>If then all these things shall be destroyed, what manner of persons
     ought ye to be in holy conduct and godliness,
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>looking unto, and preparing for the day of the coming of the Lord
     wherein the corruptible things of the heavens being on fire, shall be
     dissolved, and the mountains shall melt with fervent heat?
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>Nevertheless, if we shall endure, we shall be kept according to his
     promise. And we look for a new heavens, and a new earth wherein dwelleth
     righteousness.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>14</verse><span>Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent,
     that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot and blameless;
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>and account, even as our beloved brother Paul also, according to the
     wisdom given unto him, hath written unto you, the long-suffering and
     waiting of our Lord, for salvation.
     </span><verse>16</verse><span>As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things, in which
     are some things hard to be understood, which they who are unlearned and
     unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own
     destruction.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>17</verse><span>Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know before the things which are
     coming, beware lest ye also being led away with the error of the wicked,
     fall from your own steadfastness.
     </span><verse>18</verse><span>But grow in grace and the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus
     Christ. To him be glory both now and forever. Amen.
