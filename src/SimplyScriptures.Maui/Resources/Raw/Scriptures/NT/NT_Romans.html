     </span><verse>2</verse><span>(which he had promised before by
     his prophets in the holy scriptures)
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>concerning
     his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David
     according to the flesh;
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>and declared the Son of
     God with power, by the Spirit according to the truth through the

     <verse>7</verse><dunder><span>Wherefore I write</span></dunder><span>
     to all who are in Rome, beloved of God, called saints; grace to you, and
     peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.

    <block>
     <verse>8</verse><span>First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ,
     </span><under>
      <note><span>for you all</span></note><span>that you all are steadfast</span></under><span>, and your faith is spoken of throughout
      the whole world.
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>For God is my witness, whom I
     serve, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers,
     that you may be kept through the Spirit, in the gospel of his Son,
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>making request of you,
     </span><dunder><span>to remember me in your prayers, I now write unto you, that you will ask him in faith</span></dunder><span>,
     that if by any means, at length, I may serve you with my labors, and may
     have a prosperous journey by the will of God, to come unto you.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>11</verse><span>For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift,
     that it may be established in you to the end;
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of
     you and me.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>13</verse><span>Now I would not have you ignorant brethren, that oftentimes I purposed
     to come unto you, (but was hindered hitherto,) that I might have some
     fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the
     wise, and to the unwise.
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>And, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that
     are at Rome also.

    <block>
     <verse>16</verse><span>For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ; for it is the power of
     God unto salvation to everyone that believeth; to the Jew first, and
     also to the Greek.
     </span><verse>17</verse><span>For therein is the righteousness of God revealed through faith on his

     Samples of ungodliness
    </span></heading>

    <block>
     <verse>18</verse><span>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven
     against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men;
     </span><under>
      <note><span>who hold the truth in unrighteousness</span></note><span>who love not the truth, but remain in unrighteousness</span></under><span>,
     </span><verse>19</verse><span>after that which may be known of God is
     manifest to them.
     </span><verse>20</verse><span>For God hath revealed unto
     them the invisible things of him, from the creation of the world, which
     are clearly seen; things which are not seen being understood by the things
     that are made, through his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are
     without excuse;
     </span><verse>21</verse><span>because that, when they knew
     God, they glorified him not as God, neither were they thankful, but became
     vain in their imaginations, and their foolish hearts were darkened.
     </span><verse>22</verse><span>Professing themselves to be wise, they became
     fools.
     </span><verse>23</verse><span>And changed the glory of the
     uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to
     birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>24</verse><span>Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness, through the lusts of
     their own hearts; to dishonor their own bodies between themselves;
     </span><verse>25</verse><span>who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshiped and served the
     creature more than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>26</verse><span>For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections; for even their
     women did change the natural use into that which is against nature;
     </span><verse>27</verse><span>and likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned
     in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is
     unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error
     which was meet.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>28</verse><span>And even as they did not like to retain God according to some
     knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things
     which are not convenient;
     </span><verse>29</verse><span>being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness,
     covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit,
     malignity; whisperers,
     </span><verse>30</verse><span>backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of
     evil things, disobedient to parents,
     </span><verse>31</verse><span>without understanding, covenant-breakers, without natural affection,
     implacable, unmerciful;
     </span><verse>32</verse><span>and some who, knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such
     things are worthy of death, are inexcusable, not only do the same, but
     have pleasure in them that do them.

     The judgment of God
    </span></heading>

    <chapter>2
    </chapter>

    <block>
     <verse>1</verse><span>Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that thus
     judgest, for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for
     thou that judgest doest the same things.
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against
     them which commit such things.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>3</verse><span>And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things,
     and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and long
     suffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to
     repentance?
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>But, after thy hardness and impenitent heart, treasurest up unto
     thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous
     judgment of God;
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>who will render to every man according to his deeds;
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>to them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and
     honor and immortality, eternal life;
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>but unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey
     unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil; of the
     Jew first, and also of the Gentile;
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>10</verse><span>But glory, honor, and peace, to every man that worketh good; to the Jew
     first, and also to the Gentile;
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>for there is no respect of persons with God.
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>For as many as have sinned without the law shall also perish without
     law; and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>(for not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of
     the law shall be justified.
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things
     contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto
     themselves;
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>which show the work of the law written in their hearts, their
     conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the meanwhile
     accusing or else excusing one another;)
     </span><verse>16</verse><span>in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ
     according to the gospel.

     The Jews and the law
    </span></heading>

    <block>
     <verse>17</verse><span>Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy
     boast of God,
     </span><verse>18</verse><span>and
     knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being
     instructed out of the law;
     </span><verse>19</verse><span>and art confident
     that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in
     darkness,
     </span><verse>20</verse><span>a instructor of the foolish, a
     teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the
     law.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>21</verse><span>Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? Thou
     that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?
     </span><verse>22</verse><span>Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit
     adultery? Thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?
     </span><verse>23</verse><span>Thou that
     makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonorest thou
     God?
     </span><verse>24</verse><span>For the name of God is blasphemed among
     the Gentiles through you, as it is written.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>25</verse><span>For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law; but if thou be
     a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.
     </span><verse>26</verse><span>Therefore, if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law,
     shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?
     </span><verse>27</verse><span>And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfill the law,
     judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?
     </span><verse>28</verse><span>For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that
     circumcision, which is outward in the flesh;
     </span><verse>29</verse><span>but he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the
     heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men,
     but of God.
    </span></block>

    <chapter>3
    </chapter>

    <block>
     <verse>1</verse><span>What advantage then hath the Jew
     </span><dunder><span>over the Gentile</span></dunder><span>? Or what profit of circumcision, who is not a Jew
     from the heart?
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>But he who is a Jew from the
     heart, I say hath much every way; chiefly because that unto them were
     committed the oracles of God.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>For what if some
     did not believe? Shall their unbelief make the faith of God without
     effect?
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>God forbid; yea, let God be true, but
     every man a liar; as it is written that thou mightest be justified in thy
     sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>5</verse><span>But if we remain in our unrighteousness and
     commend the righteousness of God, how dare we say God is unrighteous who
     taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man who fears God,)
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>God forbid; for then how shall God judge the
     world?
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>For if the truth of God hath more
     abounded through my lie, (</span><dunder><span>as it is called of the Jews</span></dunder><span>,) unto his
     glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner? And not received? Because we
     are slanderously reported;
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>and some affirm that
     we say, (</span><dunder><span>whose damnation is just,</span></dunder><span>) “Let us do evil that good may
     come.”
     </span><dunder><span>But this is false.</span></dunder>
    </block>

    <block>
     <verse>9</verse><span>If not so; what then are we better than they? No, in no wise; for we
     have proved before, that Jews and Gentiles are all under sin.
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>As it is written, there is none righteous, no, not one;
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>there is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>They are all gone out of the way, they are together become
     unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>Their throat is an open sepulcher; with their tongues they have used
     deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips;
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness;
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>their feet are swift to shed blood;
     </span><verse>16</verse><span>destruction and misery are in their ways;
     </span><verse>17</verse><span>and the way of peace have they not known;
     </span><verse>18</verse><span>there is no fear of God before their eyes.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>19</verse><span>Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who
     are under the law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world
     may become guilty before God.
     </span><verse>20</verse><span>For by the law is the knowledge of sin; therefore by the deeds of the
     law shall no flesh be justified in his sight.
    </span></block>

    <heading><span>
     Righteousness by faith
    </span></heading>

    <block>
     <verse>21</verse><span>But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being
     witnessed by the law and the prophets;
     </span><verse>22</verse><span>even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto
     all and upon all them that believe; for there is no difference;
     </span><verse>23</verse><span>for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>24</verse><span>Therefore being justified only by his grace through the redemption that
     is in Christ Jesus;
     </span><verse>25</verse><span>whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood,
     to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past,
     through the forbearance of God;
     </span><verse>26</verse><span>to declare, I say, at this time his righteousness; that he might be
     just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>27</verse><span>Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? Nay; but
     by the law of faith.
     </span><verse>28</verse><span>Therefore we conclude that
     a man is justified by faith
     </span><dunder><span>alone</span></dunder><span>
     without the deeds of the law.
     </span><verse>29</verse><span>Is he the God of the Jews only? Is he not also
     of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also;
     </span><verse>30</verse><span>seeing that God will justify the circumcision
     by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>31</verse><span>Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid; yea, we
     establish the law.

     Abraham
    </span></heading>

    <chapter>4
    </chapter>

    <block>
     <verse>1</verse><span>What shall we say then that Abraham our father,
     as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>For if
     Abraham were justified by
     </span><dunder><span>the law of</span></dunder><span>
     works, he hath to glory in
     himself; but not of God.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>For what saith the
     scripture? “Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for
     righteousness.”
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>4</verse><span>Now to him who is justified by
     </span><dunder><span>the law of</span></dunder><span>
     works, is the reward reckoned, not of grace, but of
     debt.
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>But to him that seeketh not to be
     justified by
     </span><dunder><span>the law of</span></dunder><span>
     works, but believeth on him who justifieth
     not the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>6</verse><span>Even as David also describeth the blessedness of
     the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without
     </span><dunder><span>the law of</span></dunder><span>
     works,
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>saying, “Blessed are
     they
     </span><dunder><span>through faith</span></dunder><span>
     whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins
     are covered.
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>Blessed is the man to whom the Lord
     will not impute sin.”
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>Cometh this blessedness
     then upon the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision also?
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
     For we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham, for righteousness.
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>How was it then reckoned? When he was in
     circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in
     uncircumcision.
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>And he received the sign of
     circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet
     being uncircumcised; that he might be the father of all them that believe,
     though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto
     them also;
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>and the father of circumcision to
     them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps
     of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>13</verse><span>For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to
     Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness
     of faith.
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the
     promise made of none effect;
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>because the law worketh wrath; for where no law is, there is no
     transgression.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>16</verse><span>Therefore
     </span><under>
      <note><span>it is of faith, that is might be by grace</span></note><span>ye are justified of faith and works, through grace</span></under><span>, to the end the
      promise might be sure to all the seed; not to them only who are of the
      law, but to them also who are of the faith of Abraham; who is the father
      of us all,
     </span><verse>17</verse><span>(as it is written, “I have made thee
     a father of many nations,”) before him whom he believed, even God, who
     quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they
     were;
     </span><verse>18</verse><span>who against hope believed in hope, that
     he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was
     spoken, “So shall thy seed be.”
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>19</verse><span>And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead,
     when he was about a hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of
     Sarah’s womb;
     </span><verse>20</verse><span>he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong
     in faith, giving glory to God;
     </span><verse>21</verse><span>and being fully persuaded, that what he had promised, he was able also
     to perform.
     </span><verse>22</verse><span>And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>23</verse><span>Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;
     </span><verse>24</verse><span>but for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that
     raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;
     </span><verse>25</verse><span>who was delivered for our offenses, and was raised again for our
     justification.
    </span></block>

    <chapter>5
    </chapter>

    <block>
     <verse>1</verse><span>Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our
     Lord Jesus Christ;
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand,
     and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>And not only this, but we glory in tribulations also; knowing that
     tribulation worketh patience;
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>and patience, experience; and experience, hope;
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>and hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in
     our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.

     Christ died for the ungodly
    </span></heading>

    <block>
     <verse>6</verse><span>For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the
     ungodly.
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>For
     scarcely for a righteous man will one die; yet peradventure for a good man
     some would even dare to die.
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>But God commendeth
     his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for
     us.
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>Much more then, being now justified by his
     blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>For if, when we were enemies, we were
     reconciled to God by the death of his Son; much more, being reconciled, we

     Death in Adam, life in Christ
    </span></heading>

    <block>
     <verse>12</verse><span>Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin;
     and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned;
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>(for, before the law, sin was in the world; yet
     sin is not imputed to those who have no law.
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam to Moses,
     even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam’s
     transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.
     </span><dunder><span>For I say, that through the offense, death reigned over all.</span></dunder>
     <verse>15</verse><span>But the offense is not
     as the free gift, for the gift aboundeth. For, if through the offense of
     one, many be dead; much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, hath
     abounded by one man, Jesus Christ, unto many.
     </span><verse>16</verse><span>And not as, by one that sinned, is the gift;
     for the judgment is by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many
     offenses unto justification.
     </span><verse>17</verse><span>For if by one
     man’s offense death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance
     of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one,
     Jesus Christ.)
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>18</verse><span>Therefore, as by the offense of one judgment came upon all men to
     condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came
     upon all men unto justification of life.
     </span><verse>19</verse><span>For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the
     obedience of one shall many be made righteous.
     </span><verse>20</verse><span>Moreover the law entered, that the offense might abound. But where sin
     abounded, grace did much more abound;
     </span><verse>21</verse><span>that as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through
     righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.

    <block>
     <verse>1</verse><span>What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound?
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer
     therein?
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>3</verse><span>Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized
     into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into
     death; that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the
     Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>For if we have been planted together in the
     likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his
     resurrection;
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>knowing this, that our old man is
     crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that
     henceforth we should not serve sin.
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>For he that
     is dead
     </span><dunder><span>to sin</span></dunder><span>
     is freed from sin.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>8</verse><span>Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with
     him;
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>knowing
     that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more
     dominion over him.
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>For in that he died, he died
     unto sin once; but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead
     indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>12</verse><span>Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal
     body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>Neither yield ye your members as instruments of
     unrighteousness unto sin; but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are
     alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto
     God.
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>For
     </span><dunder><span>in so doing</span></dunder><span>
     sin shall not have
     dominion over you; for ye are not under the law, but under grace.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>15</verse><span>What then? Shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under
     grace? God forbid.
     </span><verse>16</verse><span>Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his
     servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of
     obedience unto righteousness?
     </span><verse>17</verse><span>But God be thanked, that ye are
     </span><dunder><span>not</span></dunder><span>
     the
     servants of sin, for ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine
     which was delivered you.
     </span><verse>18</verse><span>Being then made free
     from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.
     </span><verse>19</verse><span>I speak after the manner of men because of the
     infirmity of your flesh; for as ye have
     </span><dunder><span>in times past</span></dunder><span>
     yielded your
     members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now
     yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>20</verse><span>For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.
     </span><verse>21</verse><span>What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? For
     the end of those things is death.
     </span><verse>22</verse><span>But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have
     your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.
     </span><verse>23</verse><span>For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life
     through Jesus Christ our Lord.

     <verse>1</verse><span>Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that
     know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man
     </span><dunder><span>only</span></dunder><span>
     as
     long as he liveth?
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>For the woman which hath a
     husband is bound by the law to her husband only as long as he liveth; for
     if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>So then if, while her husband liveth, she be
     married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress; but if her
     husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress,
     though she be married to another man.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>4</verse><span>Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body
     of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is
     raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>5</verse><span>For when we were in the flesh, the motions of
     sin, which were
     </span><dunder><span>not</span></dunder><span>
     according to the law, did work in our members
     to bring forth fruit unto death.
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>But now we are
     delivered from the law wherein we were held, being dead
     </span><under>
      <note><span>wherein we were held</span></note><span>to the law</span></under><span>,
      that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the
      letter.
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>What shall we say then? Is the law sin?
     God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law; for I had not known
     lust, except the law had said, “Thou shalt not covet.”
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>But sin, taking occasion by the commandment,
     wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was
     dead.

    <block>
     <verse>9</verse><span>For once I was alive without

     the law, but when the commandment
     </span><dunder><span>of Christ</span></dunder><span>
     came, sin revived, and I died.
     </span><verse>10</verse><dunder><span>And when I believed not</span></dunder><span>
     the commandment
     </span><dunder><span>of Christ which came</span></dunder><span>, which was ordained to life, I found it
     </span><dunder><span>condemned me</span></dunder><span>

     </span><verse>11</verse><span>For sin, taking
     occasion,
     </span><under>
      <note><span>by the commandment</span></note><span>denied the commandment</span></under><span>, and deceived me; and by it I was
      slain.
     </span><verse>12</verse><dunder><span>Nevertheless, I found</span></dunder><span>
     the law to be holy, and the commandment to be holy, and just, and good.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>13</verse><span>Was then that which is good made death unto me?

     working death in me; that sin, by the

     </span><dunder><span>but when I was under law</span></dunder><span>, I was yet carnal, sold under sin.
     </span><verse>15</verse><dunder><span>But now I am spiritual; for that which I am commanded to do, I do;</span></dunder>
     <under><span>and that which I am commanded not to allow, I allow not.
      </span><verse>16</verse><note><span>for that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not, but what I hate, that do I.

     sin which dwelleth in me.
     </span><verse>18</verse><span>For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh,
     dwelleth no good thing; for to will is present with me, but to perform

     <verse>1</verse><span>Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful
     disputations.
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>For one believeth that he may eat all things; another, who is weak,
     eateth herbs.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him
     which eateth not judge him that eateth; for God hath received him.
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>Who art thou that judgest another man’s servant? To his own master he
     standeth or falleth; yea, he shall be holden up; for God is able to make
     him stand.

     <verse>5</verse><span>One man esteemeth one day above another; another esteemeth every day
     alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that
     regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that
     eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth
     not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die
     unto the Lord; whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord’s.
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might
     be Lord both of the dead and living.

     <verse>13</verse><span>Let us not therefore judge one another anymore; but judge this rather,
     that no man put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in his
     brother’s way.
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing
     unclean of itself; but to him that esteemeth anything to be unclean, to
     him it is unclean.
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, thou walkest not
     charitably if thou eatest. Therefore destroy not him with thy meat, for
     whom Christ died.

     it is evil for that man who eateth with offense.
