     <verse>1</verse><span>Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered
     throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through
     sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the
     blood of Jesus Christ; grace unto you, and peace, be
     multiplied.

     <verse>3</verse><span>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which
     according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively
     hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>to an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not
     away, reserved in heaven for you,
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready
     to be revealed in the last time.

    <block>
     <verse>6</verse><span>Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye
     are in heaviness through manifold temptations;
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>that the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold
     that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto
     praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ;
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not,
     yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory;
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>receiving the object of your faith, even the salvation of your
     souls.

     <verse>10</verse><span>Concerning which salvation the prophets who prophesied of the grace
     bestowed upon you, inquired and searched diligently;
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>searching what time, and what manner of salvation the Spirit of
     Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand
     the sufferings of Christ, and the glory which should follow.
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us
     they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by
     them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent
     down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.

     things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by
     tradition from your fathers;

     and without spot;
     </span><verse>20</verse><span>who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but
     was manifest in these last times for you,
     </span><verse>21</verse><span>who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and

     from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;

     punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to
     silence the ignorance of foolish men;
     </span><verse>16</verse><span>as free, and not using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness,
     but as the servants of God.

     grief, suffering wrongfully.
     </span><verse>20</verse><span>For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye
     shall take it patiently? But if, when ye do well, and suffer for it,
     ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.

     us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:

     we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness; by whose

     conduct of the wives;
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>while they behold your chaste conduct coupled with fear.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>Let your adorning be not that outward adorning of plaiting the
     hair, and wearing of gold, or putting on of apparel;
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not
     corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is
     in the sight of God of great price.
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>For after this manner in
     old times the holy women, who trusted in God, adorned themselves,
     being in subjection unto their own husbands;
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>even as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him
     lord; whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not
     afraid with any amazement.

     <verse>7</verse><span>Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge,

     hindered.

     contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye

     give an answer with meekness and fear to every man that asketh of
     you a reason for the hope that is in you:

     </span><verse>19</verse><span>For which cause also, he went and preached unto the spirits in
     prison;
     </span><verse>20</verse><span>some of whom were disobedient in the days of Noah, while the
     long-suffering of God waited, while the ark was preparing, wherein
     few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.
     </span><verse>21</verse><span>The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us, (not
     the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good
     conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ;
     </span><verse>22</verse><span>who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels

     <verse>1</verse><span>Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm
     yourselves likewise with the same mind;
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>for you who have suffered in the flesh should cease from sin, that
     you no longer the rest of your time in the flesh, should live to the
     lusts of men, but to the will of God.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>For the time past of life may suffice to have wrought the will of
     the Gentiles, when ye walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of
     wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries;
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>wherein they speak evil of you, thinking it strange that you run
     not with them to the same excess of riot;
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and
     the dead.
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>Because of this, is the gospel preached to them who are dead, that
     they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live in the
     spirit according to the will of God.

     charity preventeth a multitude of sins.
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>Use hospitality one to another without grudging.
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one
     to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>If any man speak, let him speak as an oracle of God; if any man
     minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth; that God
     in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ; to whom be
     praise and dominion forever and ever. Amen.

     <verse>12</verse><span>Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is
     to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you;
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>but rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ’s sufferings;
     that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with
     exceeding joy.
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the
     Spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you; on their part he is
     evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>But let none of you suffer as a murderer or as a thief, or as an
     evildoer, or as a busybody in other men’s matters.
     </span><verse>16</verse><span>Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but
