   <verse>1</verse><span>The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;
   </span><verse>2</verse><span>as it is written in the prophets:</span><quote>

   <verse>4</verse><span>John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of
   repentance for the remission of sins.
   </span><verse>5</verse><span>And there went out unto him all the land of Judea, and they of
   Jerusalem, and many were baptized of him in the river of Jordan,
   confessing their sins.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>6</verse><span>And John was clothed with camels’ hair, and with a girdle of skin about
   his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;
   </span><verse>7</verse><span>and preached, saying:</span><quote><span>
    There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am
    not worthy to stoop down and unloose.
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>I indeed
    have baptized you with water; but he shall
    </span><dunder><span>not only</span></dunder><span>
    baptize you
    with
    </span><dunder><span>water, but with fire, and</span></dunder><span>
    the Holy Ghost.

  <block>
   <verse>9</verse><span>And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of
   Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.
   </span><verse>10</verse><span>And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened,
   and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him;
   </span><verse>11</verse><span>and there came a voice from heaven, saying:</span><quote><span>
    Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
   </span></quote>
  </block>

  <block>
   <dunder><span>
    And John bear record of it.</span></dunder>
  </block>

  <block>
   <verse>12</verse><span>And immediately the Spirit took him into the
   wilderness.
   </span><verse>13</verse><span>And he was there in the wilderness
   forty days,
   </span><under>
    <note><span>tempted of Satan</span></note><span>Satan seeking to tempt him</span></under><span>; and was with the wild
    beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>14</verse><span>Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee,
   preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God;
   </span><verse>15</verse><span>and saying, “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand;
   repent ye, and believe the gospel.”
  </span></block>

   Jesus calls his first disciples
  </span></heading>

  <block>
   <verse>16</verse><span>And now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his
   brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishers.
   </span><verse>17</verse><span>And Jesus said unto them, “Come ye after me, and I will make you to
   become fishers of men.”
   </span><verse>18</verse><span>And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>19</verse><span>And when he had gone a little farther thence, he saw James the son of
   Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their
   nets.
   </span><verse>20</verse><span>And he called them; and straightway they left their father Zebedee in
   the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>21</verse><span>And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the Sabbath day he
   entered into the synagogue, and taught.
   </span><verse>22</verse><span>And they were astonished at his doctrine; for he taught them as one
   that had authority, and not as the Scribes.
  </span></block>

  <heading><span>
   Jesus casts out spirits and heals
  </span></heading>

  <block>
   <verse>23</verse><span>And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he
   cried out,
   </span><verse>24</verse><span>saying, “Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of
   Nazareth? Art thou come to destroy us? I know thee, who thou art, the
   Holy One of God.”
   </span><verse>25</verse><span>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Hold thy peace, and come out of
   him.”
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>26</verse><span>And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice,
   he came out of him.
   </span><verse>27</verse><span>And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among
   themselves, saying, “What thing is this? What new doctrine is this? For
   with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey
   him.”
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>28</verse><span>And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round
   about Galilee.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>29</verse><span>And forthwith when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered
   into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
   </span><verse>30</verse><span>And Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick of a fever; and they besought him
   for her.
   </span><verse>31</verse><span>And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and
   immediately the fever left her, and she came and ministered unto
   them.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>32</verse><span>And at evening after sunset, they brought unto him all that were
   diseased, and them that were possessed with devils;
   </span><verse>33</verse><span>and all the city was gathered together at the door.
   </span><verse>34</verse><span>And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many
   devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew
   him.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>35</verse><span>And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out and
   departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.
   </span><verse>36</verse><span>And Simon and they that were with him, followed after him.
   </span><verse>37</verse><span>And when they had found him, they said unto him, “All men seek for
   thee.”
   </span><verse>38</verse><span>And he said unto them, “Let us go into the next towns, that I may
   preach there also; for therefore came I forth.”
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>39</verse><span>And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast
   out devils.
   </span><verse>40</verse><span>And
   there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, said,
   “If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.”
   </span><verse>41</verse><span>And
   Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand and touched him, and said
   unto him, “I will; be thou clean.”
   </span><verse>42</verse><span>And as soon
   as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was
   cleansed.
   </span><verse>43</verse><span>And he straitly charged him, and
   forthwith sent him away;
   </span><verse>44</verse><span>and said unto him:
   </span><quote><span>
    See thou say nothing to any man; but go thy way, show thyself to the
    priest, and offer for thy cleansing, those things which Moses commanded,
    for a testimony unto them.
   </span></quote>
  </block>

  <block>
   <verse>45</verse><span>But he went out, and began to publish it much,
   and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly
   enter into the city, but was without in
   </span><under>
    <note><span>desert</span></note><span>solitary</span></under><span>
   places; and they
   came to him from every quarter.

  <chapter>2
  </chapter>

  <block>
   <verse>1</verse><span>And again, he entered into Capernaum after many days; and it was noised
   abroad that he was in the house.
   </span><verse>2</verse><span>And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no
   room to receive the multitude; no, not so much as about the door; and he
   preached the word unto them.
   </span><verse>3</verse><span>And they came unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne
   of four persons.
   </span><verse>4</verse><span>And when they could not come nigh unto him, for the press, they
   uncovered the roof where he was; and when they had broken it up, they
   let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.
   </span><verse>5</verse><span>When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, “Son,
   thy sins be forgiven thee.”
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>6</verse><span>But there was certain of the Scribes sitting there, and reasoning in
   their hearts, “</span><verse>7</verse><span>Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God
   only?”
   </span><verse>8</verse><span>And
   immediately, when Jesus perceived in his spirit, that they so reasoned
   within themselves, he said unto them:
   </span><quote>
    <verse>9</verse><span>Why reason ye these things in your hearts? Is it not easier to say to
    the sick of the palsy, “Thy sins be forgiven thee;” than to say, “Arise,
    and take up thy bed and walk”?
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>But that ye may know that the Son of Man hath power on earth to forgive
    sins, (he said to the sick of the palsy,)
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>I say unto thee, arise, and take up thy bed, go thy way into thy
    house.</span></quote>
  </block>

  <block>
   <verse>12</verse><span>And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and
   went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and many
   glorified God, saying, “We never saw
   </span><under>
    <note><span>it on this fashion</span></note><span>the power of God after this manner</span></under><span>.”
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>13</verse><span>And Jesus went forth again by the seaside; and all the multitude
   resorted unto him, and he taught them.
   </span><verse>14</verse><span>And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alpheus, sitting at the
   place where they receive tribute, as was customary in those days, and he
   said unto him, “Follow me;” and he arose and followed him.
  </span></block>

   Jesus comments on eating and fasting
  </span></heading>

  <block>
   <verse>15</verse><span>And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many
   publicans and sinners sat also together with him and his disciples; for
   there were many, and they followed him.
   </span><verse>16</verse><span>And when the Scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and
   sinners, they said unto his disciples, “How is it that he eateth and
   drinketh with publicans and sinners?”
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>17</verse><span>When Jesus heard this, he said unto them:</span><quote><span>
    They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick.
    I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
   </span></quote>
  </block>

  <block>
   <verse>18</verse><span>And they came and said unto him:</span><quote><span>
    The disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast; and why do the
    disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?
   </span></quote>
  </block>

  <block>
   <verse>19</verse><span>And Jesus said unto them:
   </span><quote>
    <block><span>
     Can the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with
     them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.
     </span><verse>20</verse><span>But the days will come, when the bridegroom
     shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.

     <verse>21</verse><span>No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment; else the new
     piece that filled it up taketh away from the old, and the rent is made
     worse.
     </span><verse>22</verse><span>And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine doth
     burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will be
     marred; but new wine must be put into new bottles.</span></block>

   Sabbath activities

  <block>
   <verse>23</verse><span>And it came to pass, that he went through the cornfields on the Sabbath
   day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn.
   </span><verse>24</verse><span>And the Pharisees said unto him, “Behold, why do thy disciples on the
   Sabbath day that which is not lawful?”
   </span><verse>25</verse><span>And he said unto them:</span><quote><span>
    Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungered,
    he, and they who were with him?
    </span><verse>26</verse><span>How he went
    into the house of God, in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did
    eat the shew bread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and
    gave also to them which were with him?
   </span></quote>
  </block>

  <block>
   <verse>27</verse><span>And he said unto them:</span><quote><span>
    The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.
    </span><dunder><span>Wherefore the Sabbath was given unto man for a day of rest; and also that man should glorify
    God, and not that man should not eat; for the Son of Man made the Sabbath day,</span></dunder>
    <verse>28</verse><span>therefore the Son of Man is Lord also of the
    Sabbath.

  <chapter>3

  <block>
   <verse>1</verse><span>And he entered again into the synagogue; and
   there was a man there which had a withered hand.
   </span><verse>2</verse><span>And they watched him
   </span><dunder><span>to see</span></dunder><span>
   whether he
   would heal him on the Sabbath day; that they might accuse him.
   </span><verse>3</verse><span>And he said unto the man which had the withered
   hand, “Stand forth.”
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>4</verse><span>And he said unto them, “Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath days, or
   to do evil? To save life, or to kill?” But they held their peace.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>5</verse><span>And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved
   for the hardness of their hearts, he said unto the man, “Stretch forth
   thine hand.” And he stretched out his hand; and his hand was restored
   whole as the other.
   </span><verse>6</verse><span>And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the
   Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>7</verse><span>But Jesus withdrew himself, with his disciples, to the sea; and a great
   multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judea,
   </span><verse>8</verse><span>and from Jerusalem, and from Idumea and from beyond Jordan; and they
   about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they heard what great
   things he did, came unto him.
   </span><verse>9</verse><span>And he spake unto his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him,
   because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.
   </span><verse>10</verse><span>For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to
   touch him. As many as had plagues
   </span><verse>11</verse><span>and unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and
   cried, saying, “Thou art the Son of God.”
   </span><verse>12</verse><span>And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known.

   Jesus ordains the twelve

  <block>
   <verse>13</verse><span>And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth whom he would; and they
   came unto him.
   </span><verse>14</verse><span>And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might
   send them forth to preach,
   </span><verse>15</verse><span>and to have power to heal sickness, and to cast out devils.
   </span><verse>16</verse><span>And Simon he surnamed Peter;
   </span><verse>17</verse><span>and James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he
   surnamed them Boanerges, which is, the sons of thunder;
   </span><verse>18</verse><span>and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and
   James the son of Alpheus, and Thaddeus, and Simon the Canaanite,
   </span><verse>19</verse><span>and Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him; and they went into a
   house.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>20</verse><span>And the multitude cometh together again, so
   that they could not so much as eat bread.
   </span><verse>21</verse><span>And
   when his friends heard
   </span><under>
    <note><span>of it</span></note><span>him speak</span></under><span>, they went out to lay hold on him;
    for they said, “He is beside himself.”
   </span><verse>22</verse><span>And the
   Scribes which came down from Jerusalem, said, “He hath Beelzebub, and by
   the prince of the devils, he casteth out devils.”
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>23</verse><dunder><span>Now Jesus knew this</span></dunder><span>, and he called them, and said unto them in parables:</span><quote><span>
    How can Satan cast out Satan?
    </span><verse>24</verse><span>And if a kingdom
    be divided against itself, how can that kingdom stand?
    </span><verse>25</verse><span>And if a house be divided against itself, that
    house cannot stand.
    </span><verse>26</verse><span>And if Satan rise up
    against himself and be divided, he cannot stand; but speedily hath an end.
    </span><verse>27</verse><span>No man can enter into a strong man’s house, and
    spoil his goods, except he will first bind the strong man, and then he
    will spoil his house.
   </span></quote>

  <block>
   <dunder><span>And then came certain men unto him, accusing him, saying, “Why do ye
   receive sinners, seeing thou makest thyself the Son of God.” But
   he answered them and said:</span></dunder>
   <quote>
    <block>
     <verse>28</verse><span>Verily I say unto you, all sins
     </span><dunder><span>which men have committed, when they repent,</span></dunder><span>
     shall be forgiven
     </span><dunder><span>them; for I came to preach repentance</span></dunder><span>
     unto the sons of men. And
     blasphemies, wherewith soever they shall blaspheme,
     </span><dunder><span>shall be forgiven them that come unto me, and do the works they see me do</span></dunder><span>.</span></block>

    <block>
     <dunder><span>But there is a sin which shall not be forgiven.</span></dunder>
     <verse>29</verse><span>He that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost,
     hath never forgiveness; but he is in danger of
     </span><dunder><span>being cut down out of the world. And they shall inherit</span></dunder><span>
     eternal damnation.</span></block>

   <dunder>
    <verse>31</verse><span>While he was yet with them, and while he was
    yet speaking, there came then some of

    calling unto him.</span></dunder>
   <verse>32</verse><span>And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, “Behold thy

   </span><verse>33</verse><span>And he answered them, saying, “Who is my mother, or who are my
   brethren?”
   </span><verse>34</verse><span>And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said:</span><quote><span>
    Behold my mother and my brethren!

   Parable of the sower
  </span></heading>

  <block>
   <verse>3</verse><span>And he said unto them in his doctrine:</span><quote><span>
    Hearken; behold, there went out a sower to sow;
    </span><verse>4</verse><span>and it came to pass as he sowed, some fell by
    the wayside, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>And some fell on stony ground, where it had not
    much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of
    earth; but when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no
    root, it withered away.
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>And some fell among
    thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it; and it yielded no fruit.
    </span><verse>7</verse><span>And other seed fell on good ground, and did
    yield fruit, that sprang up and increased, and brought forth, some
    thirtyfold, and some sixty, and some an hundred.

   <verse>8</verse><span>And he said unto them, “He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.”

   they that were about

   </span><verse>10</verse><span>And he said unto them:
   </span><quote><span>
    Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God; but unto
    them that are without, all these things are done in parables;
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>that seeing, they may see and not perceive; and
    hearing, they may hear and not understand; lest at any time they should be
    converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.

    <block>
     <verse>14</verse><span>The sower soweth the word.
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>And these are they by the wayside, where the word is sown; but when

   had said unto Herod, “It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother’s
   wife.”
   </span><verse>19</verse><span>Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against
   him, and would have killed him; but she could not.

   and observed

   <verse>1</verse><span>And when the Sabbath was passed, Mary Magdalene,
   and Mary the mother of James and Salome,
   </span><under>
    <note><span>had bought</span></note><span>brought</span></under><span>
   sweet spices, that

   </span><verse>2</verse><span>And very early
   in the morning, the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulcher at
   the rising of the sun;
   </span><verse>3</verse><span>and they said among
   themselves, “Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the
   sepulcher?”

   <verse>4</verse><span>But when they looked, they saw that the stone
   was rolled away, (for it was very great)
   </span><verse>5</verse><under>
    <note><span>And entering into the sepulcher, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment</span></note><span>and two angels sitting thereon, clothed in long white garments</span></under><span>; and
    they were affrighted.

    Be not affrighted. Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He is
    risen; he is not here. Behold the place where they laid him;
    </span><verse>7</verse><span>and go your way. Tell his disciples and Peter,
    that he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him as he said
    unto you.

   <verse>8</verse><span>And they went out quickly, and fled from the

   <verse>9</verse><span>Now when Jesus was risen, early on the first day of the week he
   appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils;
   </span><verse>10</verse><span>and she went and told them who had been with him, as they mourned and
   wept.
   </span><verse>11</verse><span>And they, when they heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her,
   believed not.

   <verse>12</verse><span>After that, he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they
   walked and went into the country;
   </span><verse>13</verse><span>and they went and told it unto the residue; neither believed they
   them.

   <verse>14</verse><span>Afterward, he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and
   upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they
   believed not them which had seen him after he was risen.
   </span><verse>15</verse><span>And he said unto them:
