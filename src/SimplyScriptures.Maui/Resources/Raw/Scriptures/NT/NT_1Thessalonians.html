     <verse>1</verse><span>Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, servants of God the Father
     and the Lord Jesus Christ, unto the church of the Thessalonians;
     grace unto you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord
     Jesus Christ.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>2</verse><span>We give thanks always, making mention of you all, in our
     prayers to God for you.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labor of
     love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the
     sight of God and our Father;
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>5</verse><span>For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in
     power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know
     what manner of men we were among you for your sake.
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received
     the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost;
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>so that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and
     Achaia.
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in
     Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith toward
     God is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak anything.
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>For they themselves show of us what manner of entering in we
     had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the
     living and true God;
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the
     dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to
     come.
    </span></block>

    <chapter>2
    </chapter>

    <block>
     <verse>1</verse><span>For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that
     it was not in vain;
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>but
     even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully
     entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to
     speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>For our exhortation was not of deceit,
     nor of uncleanness, not in guile;
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>but as
     we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so
     we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts.
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>For neither at any time used we
     flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloak of covetousness; God is
     witness;
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>nor of men sought we glory,
     neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been
     burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>But we were gentle among you, even as a
     nurse cherisheth her children;
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>so being
     affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted
     unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls,
     because you were dear unto us.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>9</verse><span>For ye remember, brethren, our labor and travail; for laboring
     night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of
     you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and
     unblamably we behaved ourselves among you that believe;
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>as ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one
     of you, as a father doth his children,
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>that ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his
     kingdom and glory.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>13</verse><span>For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when
     ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it
     not as the word of men, but, as it is in truth, the word of God,
     which effectually worketh also in you that believe.
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which
     in Judea are in Christ Jesus; for ye also have suffered like
     things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews;
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and
     have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to
     all men;
     </span><verse>16</verse><span>forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be
     saved, to fill up their sins always; for the wrath is coming
     upon them to the uttermost.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>17</verse><span>But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in
     presence, not in heart, endeavored the more abundantly to see
     your face with great desire.
     </span><verse>18</verse><span>Wherefore we would have come unto you,
     even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us.
     </span><verse>19</verse><span>For what is our hope, or joy, or crown
     of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus
     Christ at his coming?
     </span><verse>20</verse><span>For ye are our
     glory and joy.‌
    </span></block>

    <chapter>3
    </chapter>

    <block>
     <verse>1</verse><span>Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good
     to be left at Athens alone;
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>and sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our
     fellow -laborer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and
     to comfort you concerning your faith;
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>that no man should be moved by these afflictions; for
     yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we
     should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye know.
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know
     your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and
     our labor be in vain.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>6</verse><span>But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us
     good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good
     remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also
     to see you;
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our
     affliction and distress by your faith;
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>for now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the
     joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face,
     and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>11</verse><span>Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,
     direct our way unto you.
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward
     another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you;
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>to the end he may establish your hearts unblamable in holiness
     before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus
     Christ with all his saints.
    </span></block>

    <chapter>4
    </chapter>

    <block>
     <verse>1</verse><span>Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by
     the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to
     walk and to please God, so ye would abound more and more.
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye
     should abstain from fornication;
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in
     sanctification and honor;
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which
     know not God;
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>that no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter;
     because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also
     have forewarned you and testified.
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who
     hath also given unto us his Holy Spirit.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>9</verse><span>But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto
     you; for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all
     Macedonia; but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more
     and more;
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>and that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and
     to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>that ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and
     that ye may have lack of nothing.
    </span></block>

    <heading><span>
     The coming of the Lord
    </span></heading>

    <block>
     <verse>13</verse><span>But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning
     them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which
     have no hope.
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them
     also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that they who
     are alive at the coming of the Lord, shall not prevent them who
     remain unto the coming of the Lord, who are asleep.
     </span><verse>16</verse><span>For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,
     with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God; and
     the dead in Christ shall rise first;
     </span><verse>17</verse><span>then they who are alive, shall be caught up together into the clouds with
     them who remain, to meet the Lord in the air; and so shall we be
     ever with the Lord.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>18</verse><span>Wherefore comfort one another with these words.
    </span></block>

    <chapter>5
    </chapter>

    <block>
     <verse>1</verse><span>But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need
     that I write unto you.
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so
     cometh as a thief in the night.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>For when they shall say, “Peace and safety;” then sudden
     destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with
     child; and they shall not escape.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>4</verse><span>But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should
     overtake you as a thief.
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day;
     we are not of the night, nor of darkness.
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and
     be sober.
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>For they that sleep, sleep in the night; and they that be
     drunken, are drunken in the night.
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the
     breastplate of faith and love; and for a helmet, the hope of
     salvation.
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation
     by our Lord Jesus Christ,
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live
     together with him.
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another,
     even as also ye do.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>12</verse><span>And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labor among
     you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>and to esteem them very highly in love for their work’s sake.
     And be at peace among yourselves.
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>Now we exhort you, brethren:
     </span><dot><span>comfort the feebleminded,</span></dot>
     <dot><span>support the weak,</span></dot>
     <dot><span>be patient toward all men.</span></dot>
     <dot>
      <verse>15</verse><span>See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow
      that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men.</span></dot>
     <dot>
      <verse>16</verse><span>Rejoice evermore.</span></dot>
     <dot>
      <verse>17</verse><span>Pray without ceasing.</span></dot>
     <dot>
      <verse>18</verse><span>In everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.</span></dot>
     <dot>
      <verse>19</verse><span>Quench not the Spirit.</span></dot>
     <dot>
      <verse>20</verse><span>Despise not prophesyings.</span></dot>
     <dot>
      <verse>21</verse><span>Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.</span></dot>
     <dot>
      <verse>22</verse><span>Abstain from all appearance of evil.</span></dot>
    </block>

    <block>
     <verse>23</verse><span>And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your
     whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the
     coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
     </span><verse>24</verse><span>Faithful is he that calleth you who also will do it.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>25</verse><span>Brethren, pray for us.
     </span><verse>26</verse><span>Greet all the brethren with a holy salutation.
     </span><verse>27</verse><span>I charge you by the Lord, that this epistle be read unto all the
     holy brethren.
     </span><verse>28</verse><span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
