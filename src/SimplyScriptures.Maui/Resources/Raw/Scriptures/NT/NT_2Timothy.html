     <verse>1</verse><span>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the
     promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>to Timothy, my dearly beloved son; grace, mercy, and peace, from God
     the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>3</verse><span>I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience,
     that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and
     day;
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be
     filled with joy;
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>when I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which
     dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am
     persuaded that in thee also.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>6</verse><span>Wherefore I put thee in remembrance, that thou stir up the gift of God,
     which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power and of love,
     and of a sound mind.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>8</verse><span>Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me
     his prisoner; but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel
     according to the power of God;
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>who hath saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to
     our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given
     us in Christ Jesus before the world began;
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>but is now made manifest by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ,
     who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light
     through the gospel;
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of
     the Gentiles.
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>For
     the which cause I also suffer these things; nevertheless I am not ashamed;
     for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep
     that which I have committed unto him against that day.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>13</verse><span>Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in
     faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost
     which dwelleth in us.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>15</verse><span>This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from
     me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.
     </span><verse>16</verse><span>The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed
     me, and was not ashamed of my chain;
     </span><verse>17</verse><span>but when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found
     me.
     </span><verse>18</verse><span>The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day;
     and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest
     very well.

     <verse>1</verse><span>Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the
     same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others
     also.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life;
     that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>And if a man also strive for masteries, he is not crowned, except he
     strive lawfully.
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>The husbandman that laboreth must be first partaker of the fruits.
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>Consider what I say, that the Lord give thee understanding in all
     things.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>8</verse><span>Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the
     dead, according to the gospel;
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>wherein I suffer trouble, as an evildoer, even unto bonds; but the word
     of God is not bound.
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>Therefore I endure all things for the elect’s sake, that they may also
     obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>For this is a faithful saying:
     </span><quote><span>
      If we be dead with him, we shall also live with him;</span><break></break>
      <verse>12</verse><span>If we suffer, we shall also reign with him; if we deny him, he also
      will deny us;</span><break></break>
      <verse>13</verse><span>If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful; he cannot deny
      himself.

     Dealing with false teachers

     <verse>14</verse><span>Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord
     that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of
     the hearers.
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to
     be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.
     </span><verse>16</verse><span>But shun profane and vain babblings; for they will increase unto more
     ungodliness.
     </span><verse>17</verse><span>And their word will eat as doth a canker; of whom is Hymeneus and
     Philetus;
     </span><verse>18</verse><span>who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is
     past already; and overthrow the faith of some.
     </span><verse>19</verse><span>Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal,
     “The Lord knoweth them that are his.” And, “Let everyone that nameth the
     name of Christ depart from iniquity.”
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>20</verse><span>But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver,
     but also of wood and of earth; and some to honor, and some to dishonor.
     </span><verse>21</verse><span>If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto
     honor, sanctified, and meet for the master’s use, and prepared unto
     every good work.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>22</verse><span>Flee also youthful lusts; but follow righteousness, faith, charity,
     peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.
     </span><verse>23</verse><span>But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender
     strifes.
     </span><verse>24</verse><span>And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all
     men, apt to teach, patient;
     </span><verse>25</verse><span>in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God
     peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the
     truth;
     </span><verse>26</verse><span>and that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who
     are taken captive by him at his will.

    <block>
     <verse>1</verse><span>This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud,
     blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>without natural affection, truce-breakers, false accusers, incontinent,
     fierce, despisers of those that are good,
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of
     God;
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof; from such
     turn away.
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive
     silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>ever learning, and never able to come to a knowledge of the
     truth.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>8</verse><span>Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the
     truth; men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>But they shall proceed no further; for their folly shall be manifest
     unto all men, as theirs also was.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>10</verse><span>But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith,
     long-suffering, charity, patience,
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium,
     at Lystra; what persecutions I endured; but out of them all the Lord
     delivered me.
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
     persecution.
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>For evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and
     being deceived.
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been
     assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>and that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are
     able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ
     Jesus.
     </span><verse>16</verse><span>And all scripture given by inspiration of God, is profitable for
     doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness;
     </span><verse>17</verse><span>that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good
     works.

    <chapter>4

    <block>
     <verse>1</verse><span>I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who
     shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing in his kingdom;
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>preach the word; be instant in season; those who are out of season,
     reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>3</verse><span>For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but
     after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having
     itching ears;
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>and they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned
     unto fables.
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an
     evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>6</verse><span>For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at
     hand.
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the
     faith;
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the
     Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day; and not to me
     only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>9</verse><span>Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me;
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>for Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is
     departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee; for he is
     profitable to me for the ministry.
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>The cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring
     with thee, and the books, but especially the parchments.
    </span></block>

     <verse>14</verse><span>Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil; the Lord reward him
     according to his works;
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>of whom be thou ware; for he hath greatly withstood our words.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>16</verse><span>At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me; I pray
     God that it may not be laid to their charge.
     </span><verse>17</verse><span>Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me
     the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might
     hear; and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.
     </span><verse>18</verse><span>And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve
     me unto his heavenly kingdom; to whom be glory forever and ever.
     Amen.

     </span><verse>20</verse><span>Erastus abode at Corinth; but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick.
     </span><verse>21</verse><span>Do thy diligence to come before winter.
     Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the
     brethren.
