     <verse>1</verse><span>Paul, and Sylvanus, and Timotheus, the servants of God the
     Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, unto the church of the
     Thessalonians;
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>grace unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord
     Jesus Christ.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>3</verse><span>We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is
     meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the
     charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth;
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>so that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God, for
     your patience and faith in all your persecutions and
     tribulations that ye endure;

     Christ’s coming
    </span></heading>

    <block>
     <verse>5</verse><span>Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God,
     that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which
     ye also suffer;
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense
     tribulation to them that trouble you;
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>and to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus
     shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and
     that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ;
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>who shall be punished with destruction from the presence of the
     Lord, and from the glory of his everlasting power;
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>when he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be
     admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among
     you was believed) in that day.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>11</verse><span>Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count
     you worthy of this calling, and fulfill all the good pleasure of
     his goodness, and the work of faith with power;
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you,
     and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord
     Jesus Christ.

     <verse>1</verse><span>Now we beseech you, brethren, by the
     coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together
     unto him,
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>that ye be not soon shaken in
     mind, or be troubled by letter,
     </span><dunder><span>except ye receive it from us</span></dunder><span>; neither by spirit, nor by
     word, as that the day of Christ is at hand.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>Let no man deceive you by any means.

     The man of sin
    </span></heading>

    <block><span>
     For there shall come a falling away first, and that man of sin be
     revealed, the son of perdition;
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>who
     opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or
     that is worshiped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God,
     showing himself that he is God.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>5</verse><span>Remember ye not, that, when I was yet
     with you, I told you these things?
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>And
     now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his
     time.
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>For the mystery of iniquity doth
     already work, and he it is who now worketh,
     </span><dunder><span>and Christ suffereth him to work</span></dunder><span>, until the time is fulfilled that he shall be taken
     out of the way.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>8</verse><span>And then shall that wicked one be
     revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his
     mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming.
     </span><verse>9</verse><under>
      <note><span>Even him, whose coming is after</span></note><span>Yea, the Lord, even Jesus, whose coming is not until after there cometh a falling
      away, by</span></under><span>
     the working of Satan with all power, and signs and lying wonders,
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>and with all deceivableness of
     unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the
     love of the truth that they may be saved.
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>And for this cause God shall send them
     strong delusion, that they should believe a lie;
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>that they all might be damned who
     believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>13</verse><span>But we are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brethren
     beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen
     you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief
     of the truth;
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the
     glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which
     ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>16</verse><span>Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father,
     which hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation
     and good hope through grace,
     </span><verse>17</verse><span>comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and
     work.

    <block>
     <verse>1</verse><span>Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may
     have free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you;
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men;
     for all men have not faith.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you
     from evil.
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both
     do and will do the things which we command you.
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into
     the patient waiting for Christ.

     Warnings
    </span></heading>

    <block>
     <verse>6</verse><span>Now we command you, brethren, in the name of the Lord Jesus
     Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that
     walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he
     received of us.
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us; for we behaved
     not ourselves disorderly among you;
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>neither did we eat any man’s bread for naught; but wrought with
     labor and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable
     to any of you;
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an
     ensample unto you to follow us.
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if
     any would not work, neither should he eat.
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>For we hear that there are some which walk among you
     disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies.
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus
     Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>14</verse><span>And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that
     man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a
     brother.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>16</verse><span>Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all
     means. The Lord be with you all.
     </span><verse>17</verse><span>The salutation of Paul with mine own hand, which is the token
     in every epistle; so I write.
     </span><verse>18</verse><span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
