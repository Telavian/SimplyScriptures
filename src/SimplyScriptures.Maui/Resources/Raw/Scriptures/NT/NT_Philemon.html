     <verse>1</verse><span>Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto
     Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellow laborer,
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>and to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the
     church in thy house;
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>grace to you, and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus
     Christ.

     <verse>4</verse><span>I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus,
     and toward all saints;
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>that the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the
     acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels
     of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that
     which is convenient,
    </span></block>

     <verse>9</verse><span>Yet for loveâ€™s sake I rather beseech thee, being such a one as Paul the
     aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds;
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee
     and to me;
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>whom I have sent again; thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own
     bowels;
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have
     ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel;
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>but without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be
     as it were of necessity, but willingly.

    <block>
     <verse>15</verse><span>For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest
     receive him forever;
     </span><verse>16</verse><span>not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially
     to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the
     Lord?

    <block>
     <verse>17</verse><span>If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.
     </span><verse>18</verse><span>If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee aught, put that on mine account;
     </span><verse>19</verse><span>I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it; albeit I do
     not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.
     </span><verse>20</verse><span>Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord; refresh my bowels in
     the Lord.
     </span><verse>21</verse><span>Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou
     wilt also do more than I say.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>22</verse><span>But withal prepare me also a lodging; for I trust that through your
     prayers I shall be given unto you.
     </span><verse>23</verse><span>There salute thee Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus;
     </span><verse>24</verse><span>Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellow laborers.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>25</verse><span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
