     <verse>1</verse><span>Paul, an apostle, called of Jesus Christ through the will of God; and
     Sosthenes our brother,
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified
     in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call
     upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours;
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord
     Jesus Christ.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>4</verse><span>I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is
     given you of Jesus Christ;
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>that in everything ye are enriched of him, in all utterance, and in all
     knowledge;
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you;
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>so that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord
     Jesus Christ;
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless in
     the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son
     Jesus Christ our Lord.

     Be perfectly joined together
    </span></heading>

    <block>
     <verse>10</verse><span>Now I beseech you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that
     ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you;
     but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the
     same judgment.
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them which
     are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>Now this I say, that many of you saith, “I am of Paul;” and “I of
     Apollos;” and “I of Cephas;” and “I of Christ.”
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were ye baptized in
     the name of Paul?
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>14</verse><span>I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.
     </span><verse>16</verse><span>And I baptized also the household of Stephanas; besides, I know not
     whether I baptized any other.
     </span><verse>17</verse><span>For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel; not with
     wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none
     effect.

     The foolishness of God
    </span></heading>

    <block>
     <verse>18</verse><span>For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish, foolishness; but
     unto us which are saved, it is the power of God.
     </span><verse>19</verse><span>For it is written:
     </span><quote>
      <reference>
       <referencenote><span>Isaiah 29:14</span></referencenote><span>
       I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the
       understanding of the prudent.

    <block>
     <verse>20</verse><span>Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this
     world? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?
     </span><verse>21</verse><span>For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God,
     it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that
     believe.</span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>22</verse><span>For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks
     seek after wisdom;
     </span><verse>23</verse><span>but we preach Christ
     crucified, unto the Jews a stumbling block, and unto the Greeks
     foolishness;
     </span><verse>24</verse><span>but unto them
     </span><under>
      <note><span>which are called</span></note><span>who believe</span></under><span>,
      both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.
     </span><verse>25</verse><span>Because the foolishness of God is wiser than
     men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>26</verse><span>For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not
     many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are
     </span><under>
      <note><span>called</span></note><span>chosen</span></under><span>;
     </span><verse>27</verse><span>for God hath chosen the foolish
     things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak
     things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;
     </span><verse>28</verse><span>and base things of the world, and the things
     which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to
     naught things that are
     </span><dunder><span>mighty</span></dunder><span>;
     </span><verse>29</verse><span>that no flesh should glory in
     his presence.
     </span><verse>30</verse><span>But of him are ye in Christ
     Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and
     sanctification, and redemption;
     </span><verse>31</verse><span>that, according as it is written:
     </span><quote>

     <verse>1</verse><span>And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech
     or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>For I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ, and
     him crucified.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man’s
     wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power;
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power
     of God.

     Wisdom revealed by the Spirit

    <block>
     <verse>6</verse><span>Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect; yet not the wisdom
     of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to naught;
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom,
     which God ordained before the world unto our glory;
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>which none of the princes of this world knew; for had they known it,
     they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>But as it is written:
     </span><quote>
      <reference>
       <referencenote><span>Isaiah 64:4</span></referencenote><span>
       Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of

     <verse>10</verse><span>But God hath revealed them unto us by his
     Spirit; for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>For what man knoweth the things of a man, save
     the spirit of man which is in him? Even so the things of God knoweth no
     man, except
     </span><dunder><span>he has</span></dunder><span>
     the Spirit of God.
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>Now we have received, not the spirit of the
     world, but the Spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that
     are freely given to us of God.
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>Which things
     also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the
     Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>14</verse><span>But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; for
     they are foolishness unto him; neither can he know them, because they
     are spiritually discerned.
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged
     of no man.
     </span><verse>16</verse><span>For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But
     we have the mind of Christ.

     <verse>1</verse><span>And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as
     unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ.
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>I have fed you with milk, and not with meat; for hitherto ye were not
     able to receive it, neither yet now are ye able.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>For ye are yet carnal; for whereas there is among you envying, and
     strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>For while one saith, “I am of Paul,” and another, “I am of Apollos;”
     are ye not carnal?
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>5</verse><span>Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye
     believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>So then neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth;
     but God that giveth the increase.
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one; and every man shall
     receive his own reward according to his own labor.
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>For we are laborers together with God; ye are God’s husbandry, ye are

    <block>
     <verse>10</verse><span>According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise master
     builder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But
     let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>For other foundation can no man lay than that
     is laid, which is Jesus Christ.
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>Now if any man
     build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay,
     stubble;
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>every man’s work shall be made
     manifest; for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by
     fire; and the fire shall try every man’s work of what sort it is.
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>If any man’s work abide which he hath built
     thereupon, he shall receive a reward.
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>If any
     man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss; but he himself may be
     saved; yet so as by fire.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>16</verse><span>Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God
     dwelleth in you?
     </span><verse>17</verse><span>If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the
     temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.

     <verse>18</verse><span>Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in
     this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.
     </span><verse>19</verse><span>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God; for it is
     written:</span><quote>

     <verse>21</verse><span>Therefore let no man glory in men; for all things are yours;

     or things present, or things to come; all are yours;

     <verse>1</verse><span>Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards
     of the mysteries of God.
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>Moreover it is required of stewards, that a man be found faithful.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or
     of man’s judgment; yea, I judge not mine own self.
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>For though I know nothing against myself; yet I am not hereby
     justified; but he who judgeth me is the Lord.
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>Therefore I judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who
     both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make
     manifest the counsels of the hearts; and then shall every man have
     praise of God.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>6</verse><span>And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself
     and to Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think of
     men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one
     against another.
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>For who maketh thee to differ from another? And what hast thou that
     thou didst not receive? Now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou
     glory, as if thou hadst not received it?
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>8</verse><span>Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us;
     and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were
     appointed to death; for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to
     angels, and to men.
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>We are fools for Christ’s sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak,
     but ye are strong; ye are honorable, but we are despised.
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked,
     and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling place;
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>and labor, working with our own hands; being reviled, we bless; being
     persecuted, we suffer it;
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>being defamed, we entreat; we are made as the filth of the world, and
     are the offscouring of all things unto this day.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>14</verse><span>I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn
     you.
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have ye not
     many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the
     gospel.
     </span><verse>16</verse><span>Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.
     </span><verse>17</verse><span>For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son,
     and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my
     ways which be in Christ, as I teach everywhere in every church.
     </span><verse>18</verse><span>Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.
     </span><verse>19</verse><span>But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know,
     not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power.
     </span><verse>20</verse><span>For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in
     power.
     </span><verse>21</verse><span>What will ye? Shall I come unto you with
     a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?

     <verse>1</verse><span>It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such
     fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one
     should have his father’s wife.
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath
     done this deed might be taken away from among you.

    <block>
     <verse>3</verse><span>For verily, as absent in body but present in spirit, I have judged
     already him who hath so done this deed, as though I were present,
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together,
     and have the Spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>to deliver such a one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that
     the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.

     <verse>6</verse><span>Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth
     the whole lump?
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye
     are unleavened. For even Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us;
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the
     leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of
     sincerity and truth.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>9</verse><span>I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators;
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the
     covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go
     out of the world.
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is
     called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolator, or a
     railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such a one, no, not to
     eat.
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? Do not they
     judge them that are within?
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>But them that are without, God judgeth. Therefore put away from among
     yourselves that wicked person.

     </span><verse>2</verse><span>Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? And if the world
     shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>Know ye not that we shall judge angels? How much more things that
     pertain to this life?
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them
     to judge who are least esteemed in the church.
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among
     you? No, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?

     </span><verse>10</verse><span>nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor

     he which is joined to a harlot is one body? For two, saith he, shall be
     one flesh.

     <verse>18</verse><span>Flee fornication. Every sin that a man committeth is against the body
     of Christ, and he who committeth fornication sinneth against his own
     body.
     </span><verse>19</verse><span>What! Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which
     is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?

     pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the
     unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband; else were your children
     unclean; but now are they holy.

     not under bondage in such cases; but God hath called us to peace.

     freeman; likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ’s

     <verse>25</verse><span>Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of
     the Lord; yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the
     Lord to be faithful.
     </span><verse>26</verse><span>I suppose therefore that
     this is good for the present distress, for a man so to remain that he may
     do greater good.
     </span><verse>27</verse><span>Art thou bound unto a wife?
     Seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? Seek not a wife.
     </span><verse>28</verse><span>But if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if
     a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless, such shall have trouble
     in the flesh. For I spare you
     </span><dunder><span>not</span></dunder><span>.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>29</verse><dunder><span>But I speak unto you who are called unto the ministry.</span></dunder><span>
     For this I
     say, brethren, the time that remaineth is but short,
     </span><dunder><span>that ye shall be sent forth unto the ministry</span></dunder><span>. Even they who have
     wives, shall be as though they had none;
     </span><dunder><span>for ye are called and chosen to do the Lord’s work</span></dunder><span>.
     </span><verse>30</verse><span>And it shall be with them who weep, as though
     they wept not; and them who rejoice, as though they rejoiced not, and them
     who buy, as though they possessed not;
     </span><verse>31</verse><span>and them
     who use this world, as not using it; for the fashion of this world passeth
     away.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>32</verse><dunder><span>But I would, brethren, that ye magnify your calling</span></dunder><span>. I would have
     you without carefulness. For he who is unmarried, careth for the things
     that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord;
     </span><dunder><span>therefore, he prevaileth</span></dunder><span>.
     </span><verse>33</verse><span>But he who is
     married, careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please
     his wife;
     </span><dunder><span>therefore, there is a difference, for he is hindered</span></dunder><span>.
     </span><verse>34</verse><span>There is a
     difference also, between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth
     for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in
     spirit; but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how
     she may please her husband.
     </span><verse>35</verse><span>And this I speak
     for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that
     which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.

     <verse>36</verse><span>But if any man think that he behaveth himself
     uncomely toward his virgin
     </span><dunder><span>whom he hath espoused</span></dunder><span>, if she
     pass the flower of age, and need so require, let him do what he
     </span><under>
      <note><span>will</span></note><span>hath promised</span></under><span>, he sinneth not; let them marry.
     </span><verse>37</verse><span>Nevertheless he that standeth steadfast in his
     heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so
     decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.
     </span><verse>38</verse><span>So then he that giveth
     </span><under>
      <note><span>her</span></note><span>himself</span></under><span>

     <verse>1</verse><span>Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have
     knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>And if any man think that he knoweth anything, he knoweth nothing yet
     as he ought to know.

    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>4</verse><span>As concerning therefore the eating of those things which are in the
     world offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is nothing,
     and that there is none other God but one.
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in
     earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,)
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>but to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and
     we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by
     him.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>7</verse><span>Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge; for some with

     idol, and their conscience being weak is defiled.
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>But meat commendeth us not to God; for neither, if we eat, are we the
     better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.

    <block>
     <verse>9</verse><span>But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a
     stumbling block to them that are weak.
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol’s
     temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to
     eat those things which are offered to idols;
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>and through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom
     Christ died?
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak
     conscience, ye sin against Christ.
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while

     </span><verse>13</verse><span>Do ye not know that they which minister about
     holy things live of the things of the temple? And they which wait at the

     God, but under law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without

     </span><verse>22</verse><span>To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak; I am made all
     things to all men, that I might by all means save some.

     </span><verse>20</verse><span>When ye come together into one place, is it not to eat the Lord’s
     supper?
     </span><verse>21</verse><span>But in eating everyone taketh before his own supper; and one is hungry,
     and another is drunken.
     </span><verse>22</verse><span>What! Have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? Or despise ye the
     church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you?
     Shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>23</verse><span>For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you,
     that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took
     bread;
     </span><verse>24</verse><span>and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, “Take, eat; this
     is my body, which is broken for you; this do in remembrance of me.”
     </span><verse>25</verse><span>After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying,
     “This cup is the new testament in my blood; this do ye, as oft as ye
     drink it, in remembrance of me.
     </span><verse>26</verse><span>For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do show the
     Lord’s death till he come.”
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>27</verse><span>Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the
     Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.
     </span><verse>28</verse><span>But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and
     drink of that cup.
     </span><verse>29</verse><span>For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh
     condemnation to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body.
     </span><verse>30</verse><span>For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.
     </span><verse>31</verse><span>For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.
     </span><verse>32</verse><span>But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should
     not be condemned with the world.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>33</verse><span>Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for
     another.
     </span><verse>34</verse><span>And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together
     unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.

     </span><verse>2</verse><span>Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even
     as ye were led.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit
     of God calleth Jesus accursed; and that no man can say that Jesus is the

    <block>
     <verse>4</verse><span>Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.

     </span><verse>6</verse><span>And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which

     </span><verse>7</verse><span>But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit

     Many members, one body

    <block>
     <verse>12</verse><span>For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members
     of that one body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ.
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be
     Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made
     to drink into one Spirit.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>14</verse><span>For the body is not one member, but many.
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>If the foot shall say, “Because I am not the hand, I am not of the
     body;” is it therefore not of the body?
     </span><verse>16</verse><span>And if the ear shall say, “Because I am not the eye, I am not of
     the body;” is it therefore not of the body?
     </span><verse>17</verse><span>If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole
     were hearing, where were the smelling?
     </span><verse>18</verse><span>But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as
     it hath pleased him.
     </span><verse>19</verse><span>And if they were all one member, where were the body?
     </span><verse>20</verse><span>But now are they many members, yet but one body.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>21</verse><span>And the eye cannot say unto the hand, “I have no need of thee;” nor
     again the head to the feet, “I have no need of you.”
     </span><verse>22</verse><span>Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more
     feeble, are necessary;
     </span><verse>23</verse><span>and those members of the body, which we think to be less honorable,
     upon these we bestow more abundant honor; and our uncomely parts
     have more abundant comeliness.
     </span><verse>24</verse><span>For our comely parts have no need; but God hath tempered the body
     together, having given more abundant honor to that part which
     lacked;
     </span><verse>25</verse><span>that there should be no schism in the body; but that the members
     should have the same care one for another.
     </span><verse>26</verse><span>And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or
     one member be honored, all the members rejoice with it.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>27</verse><span>Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.
     </span><verse>28</verse><span>And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily
     prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then
     gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.
     </span><verse>29</verse><span>Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are
     all teachers? Are all workers of miracles?
     </span><verse>30</verse><span>Have all the gifts of healing? Do all speak
     with tongues? Do all interpret?
     </span><verse>31</verse><span>I say unto
     you, nay; for I have shown unto you a more excellent way, therefore
     covet earnestly the best gifts.

     </span><verse>2</verse><span>And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all
     mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I
     could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I
     give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me
     nothing.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>4</verse><span>Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity
     vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily
     provoked, thinketh no evil;
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things,
     endureth all things.

    <block>
     <verse>8</verse><span>Charity never faileth; but whether there be prophecies, they shall
     fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be
     knowledge, it shall vanish away.
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>For we know in part, and we prophecy in part.

     </span><under>
      <note><span>unknown</span></note><span>another</span></under><span>
     tongue speaketh not unto men, but
     unto God; for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he
     speaketh mysteries.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>But he that prophesieth
     speaketh unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort.
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>He that speaketh in
     </span><under>
      <note><span>unknown</span></note><span>another</span></under><span>
     tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>I would that ye all spake with tongues, but
     rather that ye prophesied; for greater is he that prophesieth than he
     that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may
     receive edifying.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>6</verse><span>Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall
     I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or
     by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>And even things without lifegiving sound, whether pipe or harp,
     except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known
     what is piped or harped?
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare
     himself to the battle?
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be
     understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? For ye shall speak
     into the air.
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and
     none of them is without signification.
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto
     him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a
     barbarian unto me.
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek
     that ye may excel to the edifying of the church.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>13</verse><span>Wherefore let him that speaketh in

      <note><span>unknown</span></note><span>another</span></under><span>
     tongue pray that he may interpret.
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>For if I pray in

      <note><span>unknown</span></note><span>another</span></under><span>
     tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>What is it
     then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the
     understanding also; I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with
     the understanding also.
     </span><verse>16</verse><span>Else, when thou
     shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of
     the unlearned say “Amen” at thy giving of thanks, seeing he
     understandeth not what thou sayest?
     </span><verse>17</verse><span>For
     thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.
     </span><verse>18</verse><span>I thank my God, I speak with tongues more
     than ye all;
     </span><verse>19</verse><span>yet in the church I had rather
     speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach
     others also, than ten thousand words in

     all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned,

     is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of
     fishes, and another of birds.
     </span><verse>40</verse><span>Also
     celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial,
     </span><dunder><span>and bodies telestial</span></dunder><span>;
     but the glory of the celestial, one; and the terrestrial, another;
     </span><dunder><span>and the telestial, another</span></dunder><span>.
     </span><verse>41</verse><span>There is one glory
     of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the
     stars; for one star differeth from another star in glory.

     <verse>42</verse><span>So also is the resurrection of the dead:
     </span><dot><span>it is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption;</span></dot>
     <dot>
      <verse>43</verse><span>it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory;</span></dot>
     <dot><span>it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;</span></dot>
     <dot>
      <verse>44</verse><span>it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body.</span></dot>

     There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.
     </span><verse>45</verse><span>And so it is written, the first man Adam
     was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.
     </span><verse>46</verse><span>Howbeit, that which is natural first, and
     not that which is spiritual; but afterwards, that which is spiritual;
     </span><verse>47</verse><span>the first man is of the earth, earthy; the
     second man is the Lord from heaven.
     </span><verse>48</verse><span>As is
     the earthy, such are they also that are earthy; and as is the
     heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.
     </span><verse>49</verse><span>And as we have borne the image of the
     earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.

     <verse>50</verse><span>Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the
     kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.
     </span><verse>51</verse><span>Behold, I show you a mystery; we shall not all sleep, but we shall
     all be changed,
     </span><verse>52</verse><span>in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the sound of the last
     trump; for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised
     incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
     </span><verse>53</verse><span>For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must
     put on immortality.
     </span><verse>54</verse><span>So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this
     mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass
     the saying that is written, “Death is swallowed up in victory.”
     </span><verse>55</verse><span>O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?
     </span><verse>56</verse><span>The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.
     </span><verse>57</verse><span>But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord
     Jesus Christ.

     may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go.

     with you, if the Lord permit.
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.
