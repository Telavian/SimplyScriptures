     <verse>1</verse><span>James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve
     tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>2</verse><span>My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into many afflictions;
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>But let patience have its perfect work, that ye may be perfect and
     entire, wanting nothing.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>5</verse><span>If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men
     liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering; for he that wavereth is
     like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>For let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord.
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>A double-minded man is unstable in all his ways.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>9</verse><span>Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted;
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>but the rich, in that he is made low; because as the flower of the
     grass he shall pass away.
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth
     the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion
     of it perisheth; so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>12</verse><span>Blessed is the man that resisteth temptation; for when he is tried, he
     shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them
     that love him.
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>Let no man say when he is tempted, “I am tempted of God;” for God
     cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man;
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>but every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and
     enticed.
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin; and sin, when it
     is finished, bringeth forth death.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>16</verse><span>Do not err, my beloved brethren.
     </span><verse>17</verse><span>Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down
     from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow
     of turning.
     </span><verse>18</verse><span>Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a
     kind of firstfruits of his creatures.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>19</verse><span>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to
     speak, slow to wrath;
     </span><verse>20</verse><span>for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.
     </span><verse>21</verse><span>Wherefore lay aside all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and
     receive with meekness, the engrafted word, which is able to save your
     souls.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>22</verse><span>But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own
     selves.
     </span><verse>23</verse><span>For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a
     man beholding his natural face in a glass;
     </span><verse>24</verse><span>for he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth
     what manner of man he was.
     </span><verse>25</verse><span>But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth
     therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this
     man shall be blessed in his deed.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>26</verse><span>If any man among you seem to be religious, and
     bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man’s religion
     is vain.
     </span><verse>27</verse><span>Pure religion and undefiled before God
     and the Father is this, to visit the fatherless and widows in their
     affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from
     </span><dunder><span>the vices of</span></dunder><span>
     the
     world.

     <verse>1</verse><span>My brethren, ye cannot have the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the
     Lord of glory, and yet have respect to persons.
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>Now if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly
     apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>and ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto
     him, “Sit thou here in a good place;” and
     say to the poor, “Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool;”
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>are ye not then in yourselves partial judges,
     and become
     </span><under>
      <note><span>judges of evil thoughts</span></note><span>evil in your thoughts</span></under><span>?
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>5</verse><span>Hearken, my beloved brethren, hath not God chosen the poor of this
     world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to
     them that love him?
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw
     you before the judgment seats?
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>If ye fulfill the royal law according to the scripture:
     </span><quote>
      <reference>
       <referencenote><span>Leviticus 19:18</span></referencenote><span>Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself,</span></reference>
     </quote><span>
     ye do well;
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>but if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of
     the law as transgressors.
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>For whosoever shall, save in one point, keep the whole law, he is
     guilty of all.
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>For he that said, “Do not commit adultery,” said also, “Do not kill.”
     Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a
     transgressor of the law.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>12</verse><span>So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of
     liberty.
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath showed no mercy;
     and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>14</verse><span>What profit is it, my brethren, for a man to say he hath faith, and
     hath not works? Can faith save him?
     </span><verse>(18)</verse><span>Yea, a man may say, “I will show thee I have faith without works;” but
     I say, “Show me thy faith without works, and I will show thee my faith
     by my works.”
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>For if a brother or sister be naked and destitute,
     </span><verse>16</verse><span>and one of you say, “Depart in peace, be warmed and filled;”
     notwithstanding he give not those things which are needful to the body;
     what profit is your faith unto such?
     </span><verse>17</verse><span>Even so faith, if it have not works is dead, being alone.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>(20)</verse><span>Therefore wilt thou know, O vain man, that
     faith without works is dead
     </span><dunder><span>and cannot save you</span></dunder><span>?
     </span><verse>19</verse><span>Thou believest there is one God; thou doest
     well; the devils also believe, and tremble;
     </span><dunder><span>thou hast made thyself like unto them, not being justified</span></dunder><span>.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>21</verse><span>Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered
     Isaac his son upon the altar?
     </span><verse>22</verse><span>Seest thou how works wrought with his faith, and by works was faith
     made perfect?
     </span><verse>23</verse><span>And the scripture was fulfilled which saith:</span><quote>
      <reference>
       <referencenote><span>Genesis 15:16</span></referencenote><span>Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness;</span></reference>
     </quote><span>
     and he was called the friend of God.
     </span><verse>24</verse><span>Ye see then that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.
     </span><verse>25</verse><span>Likewise also Rahab the harlot was justified by works, when she had
     received the messengers and sent them out another way.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>26</verse><span>For, as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is
     dead.

     <verse>1</verse><span>My brethren, strive not for the mastery, knowing that in so doing we
     shall receive the greater condemnation.
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the
     same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>Behold, we put bits in the horses’ mouths, that they may obey us; and
     we turn about their whole body.
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of
     fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm,
     whithersoever the governor listeth.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>5</verse><span>Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things.
     Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity; so is the tongue among
     our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the
     course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things
     in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind;
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>but the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly
     poison.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>9</verse><span>Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men,
     which are made after the similitude of God.
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren,
     these things ought not so to be.
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? Either a vine, figs?
     So can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>13</verse><span>Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? Let him show out
     of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and
     lie not against the truth.
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual,
     devilish.
     </span><verse>16</verse><span>For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil
     work.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>17</verse><span>But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable,
     gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without
     partiality, and without hypocrisy.
     </span><verse>18</verse><span>And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make
     peace.

     <verse>1</verse><span>From whence come wars and fightings among you? Come they not hence,
     even of your lusts that war in your members?
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>Ye lust, and have not; ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain;
     ye fight and war; yet ye have not, because ye ask not.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it
     upon your lusts.
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the
     world is enmity with God?
     Whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain,
     “The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy”?
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith:
     </span><quote>
      <reference>
       <referencenote><span>Proverbs 3:34</span></referencenote><span>God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.</span></reference>

     <verse>7</verse><span>Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee
     from you.
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>Draw
     nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners;
     and purify your hearts, ye double-minded.
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>Be
     afflicted, and mourn, and weep; let your laughter be turned to mourning,
     and your joy to heaviness.
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>Humble yourselves in
     the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>11</verse><span>Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his
     brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth
     the law; but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but
     a judge.
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy; who art thou
     that judgest another?
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>13</verse><span>Go to now, ye that say, “Today or tomorrow we will go into such a city,
     and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain;”
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life?
     It is even a vapor, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth
     away.
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>For that ye ought to say, “If the Lord will, we shall live, and do
     this, or that.”
     </span><verse>16</verse><span>But now ye rejoice in your boastings; all such rejoicing is evil.
     </span><verse>17</verse><span>Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it
     is sin.

     <verse>1</verse><span>Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come
     upon you.
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a
     witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have
     heaped treasure together for the last days.
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>Behold, the hire of the laborers who have reaped down your fields,
     which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth; and the cries of them which
     have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have
     nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist
     you.

     <verse>7</verse><span>Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold,

     of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very
     pitiful, and of tender mercy.

    <block>
     <verse>12</verse><span>But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven,

     <verse>13</verse><span>Is any among you afflicted? Let him pray. Is any merry? Let him sing

     them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord;
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>and the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise
     him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.

     <verse>17</verse><span>Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed
     earnestly that it might not rain; and it rained not on the earth by the

     forth her fruit.
