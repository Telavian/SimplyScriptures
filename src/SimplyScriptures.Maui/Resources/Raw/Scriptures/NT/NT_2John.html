     <verse>4</verse><span>I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth,
     as we have received a commandment from the Father.
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new
     commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning,
     that we love one another.
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the
     commandment, that, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should
     walk in it.

     <verse>7</verse><span>For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that
     Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an
     antichrist.

     wrought, but that we receive a full reward.
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ,
     hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath
     both the Father and the Son.

     </span><verse>12</verse><span>Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper
     and ink; but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that
     our joy may be full.
