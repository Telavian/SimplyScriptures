     <verse>1</verse><span>God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto
     the fathers by the prophets,
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath
     appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his
     person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had
     by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on
     high;
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance
     obtained a more excellent name than they.

       What is man, that thou art mindful of him? Or the son of man, that thou

       all things in subjection under his feet.

    <block><span>For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is
    not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower
     than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor;
     that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.

     destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>and deliver them, who through fear of death were all their lifetime
     subject to bondage.

     brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things
     pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.

     <verse>1</verse><span>Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider
     the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful
     in all his house.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>For he was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who
     hath builded the house hath more honor than the house.
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is
     God.
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>And Moses verily was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a
     testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>but Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold
     fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the
     end.

     <verse>7</verse><span>Wherefore as the Holy Ghost saith:</span><quote><span>
      Today if ye will hear his voice,
      </span><verse>8</verse><span>harden not your
      hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness;
      </span><verse>9</verse><span>when your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw
      my works forty years.
      </span><verse>10</verse><span>Wherefore I was grieved
      with that generation, and said, “They do always err in their heart; and
      they have not known my ways.”
      </span><verse>11</verse><span>So I sware in my wrath:

     <verse>12</verse><span>Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of
     unbelief, in departing from the living God.
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>But exhort one another daily, while it is called “Today;” lest any of
     you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our
     confidence steadfast unto the end;
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>while it is said:</span><quote>
      <reference>

     <verse>16</verse><span>For some, when they had heard, did provoke; howbeit not all that came
     out of Egypt by Moses.
     </span><verse>17</verse><span>But with whom was he grieved forty years? Was it not with them that had
     sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?
     </span><verse>18</verse><span>And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to
     them that believed not?
     </span><verse>19</verse><span>So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.

     </span><verse>2</verse><span>For unto us was the rest preached, as well as unto them; but the word
     preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that
     heard it.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>For we who have believed do enter into rest, as he said:

    <block>
     <verse>4</verse><span>For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise:</span><quote>
      <reference>

     they shall enter into my rest.”
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>6</verse><span>Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to
     whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief;
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, today, after so long
     a time; as it is said:</span><quote>
      <reference>
       <referencenote><span>Psalms 95:7–8</span></referencenote><span>Today if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</span></reference>

    <block>
     <verse>8</verse><span>For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have
     spoken of another day.
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own
     works, as God did from his.
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>Let us labor therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after
     the same example of unbelief.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>12</verse><span>For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any
     two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of body and
     spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts
     and intents of the heart.
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight; but
     all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have
     to do.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>14</verse><span>Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the
     heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>For we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling
     of our infirmities; but was on all points tempted like as we are, yet
     without sin.
     </span><verse>16</verse><span>Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may
     obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.
    </span></block>

    <chapter>5
    </chapter>

    <block>
     <verse>1</verse><span>For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in
     things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices
     for sins;
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of
     the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself
     to offer for sins.
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>And no man taketh this honor unto himself, but he that is called of
     God, as was Aaron.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>5</verse><span>So also Christ glorified not himself to be made a high priest; but he
     that said unto him:</span><quote>

     suffered.)
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto
     all them that obey him;
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>called of God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.

     <verse>11</verse><span>Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye
     are dull of hearing.

     teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and
     are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.

     <verse>9</verse><span>But, beloved, we are persuaded of better things

       My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou

     <verse>7</verse><span>If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what
     son is he whom the father chasteneth not?
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are
     ye bastards, and not sons.
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>Furthermore, we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and
     we gave them reverence; shall we not much rather be in subjection unto
     the Father of spirits, and live?
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure;
     but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness.
