     <verse>1</verse><span>In the beginning was
     </span><dunder><span>the gospel preached through the Son. And the gospel was the</span></dunder><span>
     word,
     and the word was with
     </span><dunder><span>the Son, and the Son was with</span></dunder><span>
     God, and
     </span><under>
      <note><span>the Word was God</span></note><span>the Son was of God</span></under><span>.
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>The same was in the
     beginning with God.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>All things were made by him;
     and without him was not anything made which was made.
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>In him was
     </span><dunder><span>the gospel, and the gospel was the</span></dunder><span>
     life, and the life was the light
     of men;
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>and the light shineth in
     </span><under>
      <note><span>darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not</span></note><span>the world, and the world perceiveth it not</span></under><span>.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>6</verse><span>There was a man sent from God, whose name was
     John.
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>The same came
     </span><dunder><span>into the world</span></dunder><span>
     for a
     witness, to bear witness of the light,
     </span><dunder><span>to bear record of the gospel through the Son</span></dunder><span>, unto all, that
     through him men might believe.
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>He was not that
     light, but came to bear witness of that Light.
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>Which was the true light, which lighteth every
     man that cometh into the world,
     </span><dunder><span>even the Son of God</span></dunder><span>.
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>He who was in the world, and the world was made
     by him, and the world knew him not.
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>He came
     unto his own, and his own received him not.
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>But
     as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God;
     </span><under>
      <note><span>even</span></note><span>only</span></under><span>
     to them who believe on his name.
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>He
     was born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of
     man, but of God.
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>And the
     </span><dunder><span>same</span></dunder><span>
     word was
     made flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory, the glory as of
     the Only Begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>15</verse><span>John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, “This was he of whom I
     spake; he who cometh after me, is preferred before me; for he was before
     me.”
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <dunder><span>
      For in the beginning was the Word, even the Son, who is made flesh, and
      sent unto us by the will of the Father. And as many
      as believe on his name shall receive of his fullness.</span></dunder>
     <verse>16</verse><span>And of his fullness have all we received,
     </span><dunder><span>even immortality and eternal life, through his</span></dunder><span>
     grace.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>17</verse><span>For the law was given
     </span><under>
      <note><span>by / grace / by</span></note><span>through</span></under><span>
     Moses, but
     </span><under><span>life</span></under><span>
     and truth came
     </span><under><span>through</span></under><span>
     Jesus Christ.
     </span><dunder><span>For the law was after a carnal commandment, to the administration of death;
     but the gospel was after the power of an endless life, through Jesus Christ, the Only
     Begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father.</span></dunder>
     <verse>18</verse><span>And no
     man hath seen God at any time,
     </span><under>
      <note><span>The Only Begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him</span></note><span>except he hath borne record of the Son; for except it is through him no man can be
      saved</span></under><span>.

     John the Baptist
    </span></heading>

    <block>
     <verse>19</verse><span>And this is the record of John, when the Jews
     sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem, to ask him, “Who art thou?”
     </span><verse>20</verse><span>And he confessed, and denied not
     </span><dunder><span>that he was Elia</span></dunder><span>s; but confessed, saying, “I am not the Christ.”
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>21</verse><span>And they asked him, saying, “</span><under>
      <note><span>“What then? Art thou Elias?</span></note><span>How then art thou Elias?</span></under><span>” And he said, “I am not
     </span><dunder><span>that Elias who was to restore all thing</span></dunder><span>s.”
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <dunder><span>
      And they asked him, saying,</span></dunder><span>
     “Art thou that prophet?” And he answered, “No.”
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>22</verse><span>Then said they unto him, “Who art thou? That we may give an answer to
     them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?”
     </span><verse>23</verse><span>He said:</span><quote><span>
      I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, “Make straight the way of
      the Lord,” as saith the prophet Esaias.
     </span></quote>
    </block>

    <block>
     <verse>24</verse><span>And they who were sent were of the Pharisees.
     </span><verse>25</verse><span>And they asked him, and said unto him, “Why
     baptizest thou then, if thou be not the Christ, nor Elias
     </span><dunder><span>who was to restore all things</span></dunder><span>, neither that prophet?”
     </span><verse>26</verse><span>John answered them, saying:
     </span><quote><span>
      I baptize with water, but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;
      </span><verse>27</verse><span>he it is
      </span><dunder><span>of whom I bear record. He is that prophet, even Elias</span></dunder><span>, who, coming
      after me, is preferred before me, whose shoe’s latchet I am not worthy to
      unloose,
      </span><dunder><span>or whose place I am not able to fill; for he shall baptize, not only with water, but
      with fire, and with the Holy Ghost</span></dunder><span>.
     </span></quote>
    </block>

    <block>
     <verse>29</verse><span>The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him,
     and said; “Behold the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sin of the world!”
     </span><dunder><span>And John bare record of him unto the people, saying</span></dunder><span>:
     </span><quote>
      <verse>30</verse><span>This is he of whom I said, “After me cometh a man who is preferred
      before me;” for he was before me, and I knew him, and that he should be
      made manifest to Israel; therefore am I come baptizing with water.</span></quote>
    </block>

    <block>
     <verse>31</verse><span>And John bare record, saying:</span><quote>
      <dunder><span>When he was baptized of me</span></dunder><span>, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven
      like a dove, and it abode upon him.
      </span><verse>32</verse><span>And
      </span><under>
       <note><span>I knew him not, but he that</span></note><span>I knew him; for he who</span></under><span>
      sent me to baptize with water, the same said
      unto me, “Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on
      him, the same is he who baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.”
      </span><verse>33</verse><span>And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son
      of God.

    <block>
     <verse>(28)</verse><span>These things were done in Bethabara, beyond Jordon, where John was
     baptizing.
     </span><verse>35</verse><span>Again, the next day after, John stood, and two of his disciples,
     </span><verse>36</verse><span>And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he said, “Behold the Lamb of
     God!”

     Jesus calls his first disciples
    </span></heading>

    <block>
     <verse>37</verse><span>And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.
     </span><verse>38</verse><span>Then Jesus turned, and saw them following him, and said unto them,
     “What seek ye?” They say unto him, “Rabbi, (which is to say, being
     interpreted, Master) where dwellest thou?”
     </span><verse>39</verse><span>He said unto them, “Come and see.” And they came and saw where he
     dwelt, and abode with him that day; for it was about the tenth
     hour.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>40</verse><span>One of the two who heard John, and followed Jesus, was Andrew, Simon
     Peter’s brother.
     </span><verse>41</verse><span>He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, “We have
     found the Messias,” which is, being interpreted, the Christ.
     </span><verse>42</verse><span>And he brought him to Jesus.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
     And when Jesus beheld him, he said, “Thou art Simon, the son of Jona, thou
     shalt be called Cephas,” which is, by interpretation,
     </span><dunder><span>a seer, or</span></dunder><span>
     a stone.
     </span><dunder><span>And they were fishermen</span></dunder><span>.
     </span><dunder><span>And they straightway left all, and followed Jesus</span></dunder><span>.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>43</verse><span>The day following, Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth
     Philip, and saith unto him, “Follow me.”
     </span><verse>44</verse><span>Now Philip was at Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>45</verse><span>Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, “We have found him, of
     whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth,
     the son of Joseph.”
     </span><verse>46</verse><span>And Nathanael said unto him, “Can there any good thing come out of
     Nazareth?” Philip saith unto him, “Come and see.”
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>47</verse><span>Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said of him, “Behold an
     Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!”
     </span><verse>48</verse><span>Nathanael said unto him, “Whence knowest thou me?” Jesus answering said
     unto him, “Before Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree,
     I saw thee.”
     </span><verse>49</verse><span>Nathanael answered and saith unto him, “Rabbi, thou art the Son of God;
     thou art the King of Israel.”
     </span><verse>50</verse><span>Jesus answered and said unto him, “Because I said unto thee, ‘I saw
     thee under the fig tree,’ believest thou? Thou shalt see greater things
     than these.”
     </span><verse>51</verse><span>And he said unto him, “Verily, verily, I say unto you, hereafter ye
     shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending
     upon the Son of Man.”

    <chapter>2
    </chapter>

    <block>
     <verse>1</verse><span>And on the third day of the week, there was a
     marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there.
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>And Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the
     marriage.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>And when they wanted wine, his mother
     said unto him, “They have no wine.”
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>Jesus said
     unto her, “Woman,
     </span><under>
      <note><span>what have I to do with thee?</span></note><span>what wilt thou have me to do for thee</span></under><span>? That will
      I do; for mine hour is not yet come.”
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>His mother
     said unto the servants, “Whatsoever he saith unto you,
     </span><dunder><span>see that ye</span></dunder><span>
     do it.”
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>6</verse><span>There were set there six water-pots of stone, after the manner of the
     purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>Jesus said unto them, “Fill the waterpots with water.” And they filled
     them up to the brim.
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>And he said, “Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast.”
     And they bare unto him.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>9</verse><span>When the governor of the feast had tasted the water which was made
     wine, (he knew not whence it was, but the servants who drew the water
     knew,) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>and said unto him, “Every man at the beginning doth set forth good
     wine; and when men have well drunk; then that which is worse; but thou
     hast kept the good wine until now.”
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>11</verse><span>This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of
     Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and
     </span><under>
      <note><span>his disciples believed on him</span></note><span>the faith of his disciples was strengthened in him</span></under><span>.
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and
     his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples; and they continued there
     not many days.

     Jesus clears the temple
    </span></heading>

    <block>
     <verse>13</verse><span>And the Jews’ Passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>And found in the temple those who sold oxen, and sheep, and doves, and
     the changers of money sitting.
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of
     the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers’
     money, and overthrew the tables;
     </span><verse>16</verse><span>and said unto them who sold doves:</span><quote><span>Take these things hence; make not my Father’s house a house of
     merchandise.</span></quote>
    </block>

    <block>
     <verse>17</verse><span>And his disciples remembered that it was written:</span><quote>
      <reference>
       <referencenote><span>Psalms 69:9</span></referencenote><span>The zeal of thy house hath eaten me up.</span></reference>
     </quote>
    </block>

    <block>
     <verse>18</verse><span>Then spake the Jews and said unto him, “What sign showest thou unto us,
     seeing thou doest these things?”
     </span><verse>19</verse><span>Jesus answered and said unto them, “Destroy this temple, and in three
     days I will raise it up.”
     </span><verse>20</verse><span>Then said the Jews, “Forty and six years was this temple in building,
     and wilt thou rear it up, in three days?”
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>21</verse><span>But he spake of the temple of his body.
     </span><verse>22</verse><span>When therefore he was risen from the dead, his
     disciples remembered that he had said this unto them, and they
     </span><under>
      <note><span>believed</span></note><span>remembered</span></under><span>
     the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said unto
     them.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>23</verse><span>Now when he was in Jerusalem, at the Passover,
     on the feast day, many believed on his name, when they saw the miracles
     which he did.
     </span><verse>24</verse><span>But Jesus did not commit himself
     unto them, because he knew all
     </span><under>
      <note><span>men</span></note><span>things</span></under><span>,
     </span><verse>25</verse><span>And needed not that any should testify of man;
     for he knew what was in man.

    <chapter>3

    <block>
     <verse>1</verse><span>There was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews;
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>the same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, “Rabbi, we know
     that thou art a teacher come from
     God; for no man can do these miracles which thou doest, except God be with him.”
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>Jesus answered and said unto him:
     </span><quote><span>
      Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot see
      the kingdom of God.
     </span></quote>
    </block>

    <block>
     <verse>4</verse><span>Nicodemus saith unto him, “How can a man be born when he is old? Can he
     enter the second time into his mother’s womb and be born?”
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>Jesus answered:</span><quote><span>
      Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born of water, and the
      Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
      </span><verse>6</verse><span>That which is born of the flesh, is flesh; and
      that which is born of the Spirit, is spirit.
      </span><verse>7</verse><span>Marvel not that I said unto thee, “Ye must be
      born again.”
      </span><verse>8</verse><span>The wind bloweth where it listeth,
      and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh,
      and whither it goeth; so is every one who is born of the Spirit.
     </span></quote>
    </block>

    <block>
     <verse>9</verse><span>Nicodemus answered and said unto him, “How can these things be?”
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>Jesus answered and said:

      <block><span>
       Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?
       </span><verse>11</verse><span>Verily, verily, I say unto thee, we speak that
       we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.
       </span><verse>12</verse><span>If I have told you earthly things, and ye
       believe not, how shall ye believe if I tell you heavenly things?
      </span></block>

      <block>
       <verse>13</verse><span>I tell you, no man hath ascended up to heaven,
       but he who came down from heaven, the Son of Man who is in heaven.
       </span><verse>14</verse><span>And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the
       wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up;
       </span><verse>15</verse><span>that whosoever believeth on him should not
       perish, but have eternal life.
       </span><verse>16</verse><span>For God so loved
       the world, that he gave his Only Begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on
       him should not perish; but have everlasting life.
       </span><verse>17</verse><span>For God sent not his Son into the world to
       condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.
       </span><verse>18</verse><span>He who believeth on him is not condemned; but
       he who believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed on
       the name of the Only Begotten Son of God,
       </span><dunder><span>which before was preached by the mouth of the holy prophets; for they testified of me</span></dunder><span>.
      </span></block>

      <block>
       <verse>19</verse><span>And this is the condemnation, that light is
       come into the world, and men love darkness rather than light, because
       their deeds are evil.
       </span><verse>20</verse><span>For everyone who doeth
       evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should
       be reproved.
       </span><verse>21</verse><span>But

     <verse>22</verse><span>After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judea;

     loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end.
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of
     Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, to betray him;
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and
     that he was come from God, and went to God;
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>4</verse><span>He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel,
     and girded himself.
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>After that he poureth water into a basin, and he began to wash the
     disciples’ feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was
     girded.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>6</verse><span>Then cometh he to Simon Peter; and Peter saith unto him, “Lord, dost
     thou wash my feet?”
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>Jesus answered and said unto him, “What I do thou knowest not now; but
     thou shalt know hereafter.”
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>Peter saith unto him, “Thou needest not to wash my feet.” Jesus
     answered him, “If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.”
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>Simon Peter saith unto him, “Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands
     and my head.”
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>Jesus saith to him:</span><quote><span>
      He that has washed
      </span><dunder><span>his hands and his head</span></dunder><span>, needeth not save to wash
      his feet, but is clean every whit; and ye are clean, but not all.

     <verse>11</verse><span>For he knew who
     should betray him; therefore said he, “Ye are not all clean.”
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>So after he had washed their feet, and had

      Know ye what I have done to you?
      </span><verse>13</verse><span>Ye call me
      Master and Lord; and ye say well; for so I am.
      </span><verse>14</verse><span>If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed
      your feet; ye also ought to wash one another’s feet.
      </span><verse>15</verse><span>For I have given you an example, that ye should
      do as I have done to you.
      </span><verse>16</verse><span>Verily, verily, I say

    <block>
     <verse>27</verse><span>And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him,
     “That thou doest, do quickly.”
     </span><verse>28</verse><span>Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him.
     </span><verse>29</verse><span>For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had
     said unto him, “Buy those things that we have need of against the feast;
     or, that he should give something to the poor.”

     night,) and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound
     weight.
     </span><verse>40</verse><span>Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with
     the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.
     </span><verse>41</verse><span>Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the
     garden a new sepulcher, wherein was never man yet laid.
     </span><verse>42</verse><span>There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews’ preparation day;
     for the sepulcher was nigh at hand.

     <verse>1</verse><span>The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene
     early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulcher, and seeth the stone taken
     away from the sepulcher,
     </span><dunder><span>and two angels sitting thereon</span></dunder><span>.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>2</verse><span>Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple,
     whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, they have taken away the Lord out
     of the sepulcher, and we know not where they have laid him.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>3</verse><span>Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the
     sepulcher.
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>So they ran both together; and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and
     came first to the sepulcher.
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet
     went he not in.
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulcher, and
     seeth the linen clothes lie,
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>and the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen
     clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself.
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the
     sepulcher, and he saw, and believed.
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from
     the dead.
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>Then the disciples wentaway again unto their own homes.

     <verse>11</verse><span>But Mary stood without at the sepulcher weeping; and as she wept, she
     stooped down, and looked into the sepulcher,
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>and seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the
     other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>And they say unto her, “Woman, why weepest thou?” She saith unto them,
     “Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have
     laid him.”
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>14</verse><span>And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus
     standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>Jesus saith unto her, “Woman, why weepest thou? Whom seekest thou?”
     She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, “Sir, if thou
     have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take
     him away.”
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>16</verse><span>Jesus saith unto her, “Mary.” She turned herself, and saith unto him,
     “Rabboni;” which is to say, “Master.”
     </span><verse>17</verse><span>Jesus saith unto her:</span><quote>

     came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, “Peace be unto
     you.”
     </span><verse>20</verse><span>And when he had so said, he showed unto them his hands and his side.
     Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord.
     </span><verse>21</verse><span>Then said Jesus to them again:</span><quote><span>
      Peace be unto you; as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you.

      Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand,

     <verse>1</verse><span>After these things Jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the
     sea of Tiberias; and on this wise showed he himself.
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and
     Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of
     his disciples.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>Simon Peter saith unto them, “I go a fishing.” They say unto him, “We
     also go with thee.” They went forth, and entered into a ship
     immediately; and that night they caught nothing.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>4</verse><span>But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore; but the
     disciples knew not that it was Jesus.
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>Then Jesus saith unto them, “Children, have ye any meat?” They answered
     him, “No.”
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>6</verse><span>And he said unto them, “Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and
     ye shall find.” They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw
     it for the multitude of fishes.
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, “It is the
     Lord.”
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
     Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher’s coat
     unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea.
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>And the other disciples came in a little ship,
     (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,)
     dragging the net with fishes.
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>As soon then as
     they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid
     thereon, and bread.
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>Jesus saith unto them,
     “Bring of the fish which ye have now caught.”
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>11</verse><span>Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, a
     hundred and fifty and three; and for all there were so many, yet was not
     the net broken.
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>Jesus saith unto them, “Come and dine.”
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
     And none of the disciples durst ask him, “Who art thou?” knowing that it
     was the Lord.
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>Jesus then cometh, and taketh
     bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise.
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>This
     is now the third time that Jesus showed himself to his disciples, after
     that he was risen from the dead.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>15</verse><span>So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, “Simon, son of
     Jonas, lovest thou me more than these?” He saith unto him, “Yea, Lord;
     thou knowest that I love thee.” He saith unto him, “Feed my
     lambs.”
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>16</verse><span>He saith to him again the second time, “Simon, son of Jonas, lovest
     thou me?” He saith unto him, “Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee.”
     He saith unto him, “Feed my sheep.”
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>17</verse><span>He saith unto him the third time, “Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou
     me?” Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, “Lovest
     thou me?” And he said unto him, “Lord, thou knowest all things; thou
     knowest that I love thee.” Jesus saith unto him:
     </span><quote>

       Feed my sheep.

       <verse>18</verse><span>Verily, verily, I say unto thee, when thou wast young, thou girdest
       thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest; but when thou shalt be old,
       thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and
       carry thee whither thou wouldest not.</span></block>

     <verse>19</verse><span>This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when
     he had spoken this, he saith unto him, “Follow me.”
     </span><verse>20</verse><span>Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved
     following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, “Lord,
     which is he that betrayeth thee?”
     </span><verse>21</verse><span>Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, “Lord, and what shall this man do?”
     </span><verse>22</verse><span>Jesus saith unto him, “If I will that he tarry till I come, what is
     that to thee? Follow thou me.”
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>23</verse><span>Then went this saying abroad among the brethren that that disciple
     should not die; yet Jesus said not unto him, “He shall not die;” but,
     “If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?”
     </span><verse>24</verse><span>This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these
     things; and we know that his testimony is true.
     </span><verse>25</verse><span>And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if
     they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself
     could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.
