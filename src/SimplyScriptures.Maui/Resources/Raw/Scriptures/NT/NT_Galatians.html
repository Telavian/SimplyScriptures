     Perverting the gospel of Christ
    </span></heading>

    <block>
     <verse>6</verse><span>I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into
     the grace of Christ unto another gospel;
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would
     pervert the gospel of Christ.
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel
     unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be
     accursed.
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>As we said before, so say I now again, if any man preach any other
     gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be
     accursed.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>10</verse><span>For do I now please men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? For if
     I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of
     me is not after man.
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by
     the revelation of Jesus Christ.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>13</verse><span>For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews’
     religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God,
     and wasted it;
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>and profited in the Jews’ religion above many my equals in mine own
     nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my
     fathers.
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother’s womb,
     and called me by his grace,
     </span><verse>16</verse><span>to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen;
     immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood;
     </span><verse>17</verse><span>neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before
     me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>18</verse><span>Then after three years I went up to
     Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.
     </span><verse>19</verse><span>But of the other apostles saw I none, save
     James the Lord’s brother.
     </span><verse>20</verse><span>Now the things
     which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.
     </span><verse>21</verse><span>Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria
     and Cilicia;
     </span><verse>22</verse><span>and was unknown by face unto
     the churches of Judea which were in Christ;
     </span><verse>23</verse><span>but they had heard only, that he which
     persecutest us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he
     destroyed.
     </span><verse>24</verse><span>And they glorified God
     </span><under>
      <note><span>in me</span></note><span>on account of me</span></under><span>.

    <block>
     <verse>1</verse><span>Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with
     Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel
     which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were
     of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to
     be circumcised.
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>Notwithstanding, there were some brought in by false brethren
     unawares, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have
     in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage;
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>to whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the
     truth of the gospel might continue with you.
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>But of those who seemed to be somewhat, whatsoever they were, it
     maketh no matter to me; God accepteth no man’s person; for they who
     seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me;
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>but contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the
     uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the
     circumcision was unto Peter;
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>(for he that wrought effectually in Peter
     to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me
     toward the Gentiles;)
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>and when James,
     Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that
     was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of
     fellowship; that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the
     circumcision.
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>Only they would that we
     should remember the poor; the same which I was also forward to do.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>11</verse><span>But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face,
     because he was to be blamed.
     </span><verse>12</verse><span>For before that certain came from James, he did eat with Gentiles;
     but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing
     them which were of the circumcision.
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that
     Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the
     truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, “If thou,
     being a Jew, livest after the manner of the Gentiles, and not as do
     the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the
     Jews?”
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>15</verse><span>We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,
     </span><verse>16</verse><span>knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by
     the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ,
     that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the
     works of the law; for by the works of the law shall no flesh be
     justified.
     </span><verse>17</verse><span>But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also
     are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God
     forbid.
     </span><verse>18</verse><span>For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a
     transgressor.
     </span><verse>19</verse><span>For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto
     God.
     </span><verse>20</verse><span>I am crucified with Christ; nevertheless I live; yet not I, but
     Christ liveth in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I
     live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself
     for me.
     </span><verse>21</verse><span>I do not frustrate the grace of God; for if righteousness come by
     the law, then Christ is dead in vain.
    </span></block>

    <chapter>3
    </chapter>

    <block>
     <verse>1</verse><span>O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not
     obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently
     set forth, crucified among you?
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>This only would I learn of you, received ye the Spirit by the works
     of the law, or by the hearing of faith?
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>Are ye so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made
     perfect by the flesh?
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>Have ye suffered so many things in vain? If it be yet in vain.
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh
     miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the
     hearing of faith?
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>6</verse><span>Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for
     righteousness.
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the
     children of Abraham.
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen
     through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham,
     saying:

     <verse>9</verse><span>So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse; for
     it is written:

     <verse>13</verse><span>Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a

     <verse>14</verse><span>that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through

    <heading><span>
     The law and the promise
    </span></heading>

    <block>
     <verse>15</verse><span>Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; though it be but a man’s
     covenant, yet when it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth
     thereto.
     </span><verse>16</verse><span>Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not,
     “and to seeds,” as of many; but as of one, “and to thy seed,” which
     is Christ.
     </span><verse>17</verse><span>And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God
     in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after,
     cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.
     </span><verse>18</verse><span>For if the inheritance is of the law, then it is no more of
     promise; but God gave it to Abraham by promise.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>19</verse><span>Wherefore then, the law was added because
     of transgressions, till the seed come to whom the promise was made
     </span><dunder><span>in the law given to Moses</span></dunder><span>,
     </span><under>
      <note><span>and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator</span></note><span>who was ordained by the hand of angels to be a mediator of this first covenant, (the law.)</span></under>
     <verse>20</verse><span>Now this mediator was not a mediator
     </span><under>
      <note><span>of one, but God is one.</span></note><span>of the new covenant; but there is one mediator of the new covenant, who is Christ</span></under><span>,
     </span><dunder><span>as it is written in the law concerning the promises made to Abraham and his seed</span></dunder><span>.
     </span><dunder><span>Now Christ is the mediator of life; for this is the promise which God made unto Abraham.</span></dunder>
    </block>

    <block>
     <verse>21</verse><span>Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid; for if
     there had been a law given which could have given life, verily
     righteousness should have been by the law.
     </span><verse>22</verse><span>But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by
     faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>23</verse><span>But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the
     faith which should afterwards be revealed.
     </span><verse>24</verse><span>Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster until Christ, that we might
     be justified by faith.
     </span><verse>25</verse><span>But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a
     schoolmaster.
    </span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>26</verse><span>For ye are all the children of God by faith in Jesus Christ.
     </span><verse>27</verse><span>For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on
     Christ.
     </span><verse>28</verse><span>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free,
     there is neither male nor female; for ye are all one in Christ
     Jesus.
     </span><verse>29</verse><span>And if ye are Christ’s then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs
     according to the promise.

     <verse>1</verse><span>Now I say, that the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth
     nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the
     father.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the
     elements of the world;
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>but when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son,
     made of a woman, made under the law,
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the
     adoption of sons.
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son
     into your hearts, crying, “Abba, Father.”
     </span><verse>7</verse><span>Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then
     an heir of God through Christ.

    <block>
     <verse>8</verse><span>Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which
     by nature are no gods.
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God,
     how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye
     desire again to be in bondage?
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years.

      ye have not injured me at all by your sayings.
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh
     I preached the gospel unto you at the first.
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>And my temptation which was in my flesh ye
     despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even
     as Christ Jesus.
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>Where is then the
     blessedness ye spake of? For I bear you record, that, if it had been
     possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them
     to me.
     </span><verse>16</verse><span>Am I therefore become your enemy,

     not only when I am present with you.
     </span><verse>19</verse><span>My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ
     be formed in you,

     <verse>1</verse><span>Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual,
     restore such a one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself,
     lest thou also be tempted.
     </span><verse>2</verse><span>Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he
     deceiveth himself.
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have
     rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>For every man shall bear his own burden.
     </span><verse>6</verse><span>Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that
     teacheth in all good things.

     <verse>7</verse><span>Be not deceived; God is not mocked; for whatsoever a man soweth,
     that shall he also reap.
     </span><verse>8</verse><span>For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption;
     but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life
     everlasting.
     </span><verse>9</verse><span>And let us not be weary in well doing; for in due season we shall
     reap, if we faint not.
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men,
     especially unto them who are of the household of faith.

     <verse>12</verse><span>As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, they constrain
     you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for
     the cross of Christ.
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but
     desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord
     Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the
     world.
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor
     uncircumcision, but a new creature.
     </span><verse>16</verse><span>And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and
     mercy, and upon the Israel of God.
