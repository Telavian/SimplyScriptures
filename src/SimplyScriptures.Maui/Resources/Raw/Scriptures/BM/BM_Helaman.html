    Appointing a chief judge

   <block>
    <verse>1</verse><span>And now behold, it came to pass in the commencement of the
    fortieth year of the reign of the judges over the people of
    Nephi, there began to be a serious difficulty among the people
    of the Nephites.
    </span><verse>2</verse><span>For behold, Pahoran had died, and gone the way of all the
    earth; therefore there began to be a serious contention
    concerning who should have the judgment-seat among the brethren,
    who were the sons of Pahoran.
    </span><verse>3</verse><span>Now these are their names who did contend for the
    judgment-seat, who did also cause the people to contend:
    Pahoran, Paanchi, and Pacumeni.
    </span><verse>4</verse><span>Now these are not all the sons of Pahoran (for he had many),
    but these are they who did contend for the judgment-seat;
    therefore, they did cause three divisions among the
    people.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>5</verse><span>Nevertheless, it came to pass that
    Pahoran was appointed by the voice of the people to be
    </span><under>
     <original><span>a chief judge</span></original><span>chief judge</span></under><span>
    and a governor over the people of Nephi.
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>And it came to pass that Pacumeni, when
    he saw that he could not obtain the judgment-seat, he did unite
    with the voice of the people.
    </span><verse>7</verse><span>But
    behold, Paanchi, and that part of the people that were desirous
    that he should be their governor, was exceedingly wroth;
    therefore, he was about to flatter away those people to rise up in
    rebellion against their brethren.
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>And it
    came to pass as he was about to do this, behold, he was taken, and
    was tried according to the voice of the people, and condemned unto
    death; for he had raised up in rebellion and sought to destroy the
    liberty of the people.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>9</verse><span>Now when those people who were desirous that he should be their
    governor saw that he was condemned unto death, therefore they
    were angry, and behold, they sent forth one Kishkumen, even to
    the judgment-seat of Pahoran, and murdered Pahoran as he sat
    upon the judgment-seat.
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>And he was pursued by the servants of Pahoran; but behold, so
    speedy was the flight of Kishkumen that no man could overtake
    him.
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>And he went unto those that sent him, and they all entered into
    a covenant, yea, swearing by their everlasting Maker, that they
    would tell no man that Kishkumen had murdered Pahoran.
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>Therefore, Kishkumen was not known among the people of Nephi,
    for he was in disguise at the time that he murdered Pahoran. And
    Kishkumen and his band, who had covenanted with him, did mingle
    themselves among the people, in a manner that they all could not
    be found; but as many as were found were condemned unto
    death.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>13</verse><span>And now behold, Pacumeni was appointed, according to the voice
    of the people, to be a chief judge and a governor over the
    people, to reign in the stead of his brother Pahoran; and it was
    according to his right. And all this was done in the fortieth
    year of the reign of the judges; and it had an end.

    Moronihah repels Lamanites
   </span></heading>

   <block>
    <verse>14</verse><span>And it came to pass in the forty and first year of the reign of
    the judges, that the Lamanites had gathered together an
    innumerable army of men, and armed them with swords, and with
    cimeters and with bows, and with arrows, and with head-plates,
    and with breastplates, and with all manner of shields of every
    kind.
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>And they came down again that they might pitch battle against
    the Nephites.
   </span></block>

   <block><span>
    And they were led by a man whose name was Coriantumr; and he was a
    descendant of Zarahemla; and he was a dissenter from among the
    Nephites; and he was a large and a mighty man.
    </span><verse>16</verse><span>Therefore, the king of the Lamanites,
    whose name was Tubaloth, who was the son of Ammoron, supposing
    that Coriantumr, being a mighty man, could stand against the
    Nephites, with his strength and also with his great wisdom,
    insomuch that by sending him forth he should gain power over the
    Nephites—</span><verse>17</verse><span>therefore he did stir them up
    to anger, and he did gather together his armies, and he did
    appoint Coriantumr to be their leader, and did cause that they
    should march down to the land of Zarahemla to battle against the
    Nephites.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>18</verse><span>And it came to pass that because of so much contention and so
    much difficulty in the government, that they had not kept
    sufficient guards in the land of Zarahemla; for they had
    supposed that the Lamanites durst not come into the heart of
    their lands to attack that great city Zarahemla.
    </span><verse>19</verse><span>But it came to pass that Coriantumr did march forth at the head
    of his numerous host, and came upon the inhabitants of the city,
    and their march was with such exceedingly great speed that there
    was no time for the Nephites to gather together their armies.
    </span><verse>20</verse><span>Therefore Coriantumr did cut down the watch by the entrance of
    the city, and did march forth with his whole army into the city,
    and they did slay every one who did oppose them, insomuch that
    they did take possession of the whole city.
    </span><verse>21</verse><span>And it came to pass that Pacumeni, who was the chief judge, did
    flee before Coriantumr, even to the walls of the city. And it
    came to pass that Coriantumr did smite him against the wall,
    insomuch that he died. And thus ended the days of
    Pacumeni.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>22</verse><span>And now when Coriantumr saw that he was in possession of the
    city of Zarahemla, and saw that the Nephites had fled before
    them, and were slain, and were taken, and were cast into prison,
    and that he had obtained the possession of the strongest hold in
    all the land, his heart took courage insomuch that he was about
    to go forth against all the land.
    </span><verse>23</verse><span>And now he did not tarry in the land of Zarahemla, but he did
    march forth with a large army, even towards the city of
    Bountiful; for it was his determination to go forth and cut his
    way through with the sword, that he might obtain the north parts
    of the land.
    </span><verse>24</verse><span>And, supposing that their greatest strength was in the center
    of the land, therefore he did march forth, giving them no time
    to assemble themselves together save it were in small bodies;
    and in this manner they did fall upon them and cut them down to
    the earth.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>25</verse><span>But behold, this march of Coriantumr through the center of the
    land gave Moronihah great advantage over them, notwithstanding
    the greatness of the number of the Nephites who were slain.
    </span><verse>26</verse><span>For behold, Moronihah had supposed that the Lamanites durst not
    come into the center of the land, but that they would attack the
    cities round about in the borders as they had hitherto done;
    therefore Moronihah had caused that their strong armies should
    maintain those parts round about by the borders.
    </span><verse>27</verse><span>But behold, the Lamanites were not frightened according to his
    desire, but they had come into the center of the land, and had
    taken the capital city which was the city of Zarahemla, and were
    marching through the most capital parts of the land, slaying the
    people with a great slaughter, both men, women, and children,
    taking possession of many cities and of many strongholds.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>28</verse><span>But when Moronihah had discovered this, he immediately sent
    forth Lehi with an army round about to head them before they
    should come to the land Bountiful.
    </span><verse>29</verse><span>And thus he did; and he did head them before they came to the
    land Bountiful, and gave unto them battle, insomuch that they
    began to retreat back towards the land of Zarahemla.
    </span><verse>30</verse><span>And it came to pass that Moronihah did head them in their
    retreat, and did give unto them battle, insomuch that it became
    an exceedingly bloody battle; yea, many were slain, and among
    the number who were slain Coriantumr was also found.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>31</verse><span>And now, behold, the Lamanites could not retreat either way,
    neither on the north, nor on the south, nor on the east, nor on
    the west, for they were surrounded on every hand by the
    Nephites.
    </span><verse>32</verse><span>And thus had Coriantumr plunged the Lamanites into the midst of
    the Nephites, insomuch that they were in the power of the
    Nephites, and he himself was slain, and the Lamanites did yield
    themselves into the hands of the Nephites.
    </span><verse>33</verse><span>And it came to pass that Moronihah took possession of the city
    of Zarahemla again, and caused that the Lamanites who had been
    taken prisoners should depart out of the land in peace.
    </span><verse>34</verse><span>And thus ended the forty and first year of the reign of the
    judges.

    Gadiantons flee Helaman
   </span></heading>

   <chapter>2
   </chapter>

   <block>
    <verse>1</verse><span>And it came to pass in the forty and second year of the reign
    of the judges, after Moronihah had established again peace
    between the Nephites and the Lamanites, behold there was no one
    to fill the judgment-seat; therefore there began to be a
    contention again among the people concerning who should fill the
    judgment-seat.
    </span><verse>2</verse><span>And it came to pass that Helaman, who was the son of Helaman,
    was appointed to fill the judgment-seat, by the voice of the
    people.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>3</verse><span>But behold, Kishkumen, who had murdered Pahoran, did lay wait
    to destroy Helaman also; and he was upheld by his band, who had
    entered into a covenant that no one should know his wickedness.
    </span><verse>4</verse><span>For there was one Gadianton, who was exceedingly expert in many
    words, and also in his craft, to carry on the secret work of
    murder and of robbery; therefore he became the leader of the
    band of Kishkumen.
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>Therefore he did flatter them, and also Kishkumen, that if they
    would place him in the judgment-seat he would grant unto those
    who belonged to his band that they should be placed in power and
    authority among the people; therefore Kishkumen sought to
    destroy Helaman.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>6</verse><span>And it came to pass as he went forth towards the judgment-seat
    to destroy Helaman, behold one of the servants of Helaman,
    having been out by night, and having obtained, through disguise,
    a knowledge of those plans which had been laid by this band to
    destroy Helaman—</span><verse>7</verse><span>and it came to pass that he met Kishkumen, and he gave unto him
    a sign; therefore Kishkumen made known unto him the object of
    his desire, desiring that he would conduct him to the
    judgment-seat that he might murder Helaman.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>8</verse><span>And when the servant of Helaman had known all the heart of
    Kishkumen, and how that it was his object to murder, and also
    that it was the object of all those who belonged to his band to
    murder, and to rob, and to gain power, (and this was their
    secret plan, and their combination) the servant of Helaman said
    unto Kishkumen, “Let us go forth unto the judgment-seat.”
    </span><verse>9</verse><span>Now this did please Kishkumen exceedingly, for he did suppose
    that he should accomplish his design; but behold, the servant of
    Helaman, as they were going forth unto the judgment-seat, did
    stab Kishkumen even to the heart, that he fell dead without a
    groan. And he ran and told Helaman all the things which he had
    seen, and heard, and done.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>10</verse><span>And it came to pass that Helaman did send forth to take this
    band of robbers and secret murderers, that they might be
    executed according to the law.
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>But behold, when
    Gadianton had found that Kishkumen did not return he feared
    lest that he should be destroyed; therefore he caused that his
    band should follow him. And they took their flight out of the
    land, by a secret way, into the wilderness; and thus when
    Helaman sent forth to take them they could nowhere be found.
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>And more of this Gadianton shall be
    spoken hereafter. And thus ended the forty and second year of the
    reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>13</verse><span>And behold, in the end of this book ye shall see that this
    Gadianton did prove the overthrow, yea, almost the entire
    destruction of the people of Nephi.
    </span><verse>14</verse><span>Behold I do not mean the end of the book of Helaman, but I mean
    the end of the book of Nephi, from which I have taken all the
    account which I have written.

    <verse>1</verse><span>And now it came to pass in the forty and third year of the
    reign of the judges, there was no contention among the people of
    Nephi save it were a little pride which was in the church, which
    did cause some little dissensions among the people, which
    affairs were settled in the ending of the forty and third year.
    </span><verse>2</verse><span>And there was no contention among the people in the forty and

    Inheriting the land northward
   </span></heading>

   <block>
    <verse>3</verse><span>And it came to pass in the forty and sixth, yea there was much
    contention and many dissensions; in the which there were an
    exceedingly great many who departed out of the land of
    Zarahemla, and went forth unto the land northward to inherit the
    land.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>4</verse><span>And they did travel to an exceedingly great distance, insomuch
    that they came to large bodies of water and many rivers.
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>Yea, and even they did spread forth into all parts of the land,
    into whatever parts it had not been rendered desolate and
    without timber, because of the many inhabitants who had before
    inherited the land.
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>And now no part of the land was desolate, save it were for
    timber; but because of the greatness of the destruction of the
    people who had before inhabited the land it was called
    desolate.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>7</verse><span>And there being but little timber upon the face of the land,
    nevertheless the people who went forth became exceedingly expert
    in the working of cement; therefore they did build houses of
    cement, in the which they did dwell.
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>And it came to pass that they did multiply and spread, and did
    go forth from the land southward to the land northward, and did
    spread insomuch that they began to cover the face of the whole
    earth, from the sea south to the sea north, from the sea west to
    the sea east.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>9</verse><span>And the people who were in the land northward did dwell in
    tents, and in houses of cement, and they did suffer whatsoever
    tree should spring up upon the face of the land that it should
    grow up, that in time they might have timber to build their
    houses, yea, their cities, and their temples, and their
    synagogues, and their sanctuaries, and all manner of their
    buildings.
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>And it came to pass as timber was exceedingly scarce in the
    land northward, they did send forth much by the way of shipping.
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>And thus they did enable the people in the land northward that
    they might build many cities, both of wood and of cement.
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>And it came to pass that there were many of the people of
    Ammon, who were Lamanites by birth, did also go forth into this
    land.

      by the Nephites, even until they have fallen into transgression
      and have been murdered, plundered, and hunted, and driven forth,
      and slain, and scattered upon the face of the earth, and mixed
      with the Lamanites until they are no more called the Nephites,
      becoming wicked, and wild, and ferocious, yea, even becoming
      Lamanites.

    disturbances, and wars, and dissensions, among the people of
    Nephi.
    </span><verse>18</verse><span>The forty and sixth year of the reign of the judges ended;

    Peace and prosperity

   <block>
    <verse>20</verse><span>Nevertheless Helaman did fill the judgment-seat with justice
    and equity; yea, he did observe to keep the statutes, and the
    judgments, and the commandments of God; and he did do that which
    was right in the sight of God continually; and he did walk after
    the ways of his father, insomuch that he did prosper in the
    land.
    </span><verse>21</verse><span>And it came to pass that he had two sons. He gave unto the
    eldest the name of Nephi, and unto the youngest, the name of
    Lehi. And they began to grow up unto the Lord.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>22</verse><span>And it came to pass that the wars and contentions began to
    cease, in a small degree, among the people of the Nephites, in
    the latter end of the forty and eighth year of the reign of the
    judges over the people of Nephi.
    </span><verse>23</verse><span>And it came to pass in the forty and ninth year of the reign of
    the judges, there was continual peace established in the land,
    all save it were the secret combinations which Gadianton the
    robber had established in the more settled parts of the land,
    which at that time were not known unto those who were at the
    head of government; therefore they were not destroyed out of the
    land.

   <block>
    <verse>24</verse><span>And it came to pass that in this same year there was
    exceedingly great prosperity in the church, insomuch that there
    were thousands who did join themselves unto the church and were
    baptized unto repentance.
    </span><verse>25</verse><span>And so great was the prosperity of the church, and so many the
    blessings which were poured out upon the people, that even the
    high priests and the teachers were themselves astonished beyond
    measure.

    Now this was a great evil, which did cause the more humble part of
    the people to suffer great persecutions, and to wade through much
    affliction.
    </span><verse>35</verse><span>Nevertheless they did fast
    and pray oft, and did wax stronger and stronger in their humility,
    and firmer and firmer in the faith of Christ, unto the filling
    their souls with joy and consolation, yea, even to the purifying
    and the sanctification of their hearts, which sanctification
    cometh because of their yielding their hearts unto God.

    <verse>37</verse><span>And it came to pass in the fifty and third year of the reign of
    the judges, Helaman died, and his eldest son Nephi began to
    reign in his stead. And it came to pass that he did fill the

   <block>
    <verse>1</verse><span>And it came to pass in the fifty and fourth year there were
    many dissensions in the church, and there was also a contention
    among the people, insomuch that there was much bloodshed.
    </span><verse>2</verse><span>And the rebellious part were slain and driven out of the land,
    and they did go unto the king of the Lamanites.
    </span><verse>3</verse><span>And it came to pass that they did endeavor to stir up the
    Lamanites to war against the Nephites; but behold, the Lamanites
    were exceedingly afraid, insomuch that they would not hearken to
    the words of those dissenters.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>4</verse><span>But it came to pass in the fifty and sixth year of the reign of
    the judges, there were dissenters who went up from the Nephites
    unto the Lamanites; and they succeeded with those others in
    stirring them up to anger against the Nephites; and they were
    all that year preparing for war.
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>And in the fifty and seventh year they did come down against
    the Nephites to battle, and they did commence the work of death;
    yea, insomuch that in the fifty and eighth year of the reign of
    the judges they succeeded in obtaining possession of the land of
    Zarahemla; yea, and also all the lands, even unto the land which
    was near the land Bountiful.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>6</verse><span>And the Nephites and the armies of Moronihah were driven even
    into the land of Bountiful;
    </span><verse>7</verse><span>and there they did fortify against the Lamanites, from the west
    sea, even unto the east; it being a day’s journey for a Nephite,
    on the line which they had fortified and stationed their armies
    to defend their north country.
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>And thus those dissenters of the Nephites, with the help of a
    numerous army of the Lamanites, had obtained all the possession
    of the Nephites which was in the land southward. And all this
    was done in the fifty and eighth and ninth years of the reign of
    the judges.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>9</verse><span>And it came to pass in the sixtieth year
    of the reign of the judges, Moronihah did succeed with his armies
    in obtaining many parts of the land; yea, they
    </span><under>
     <printer><span>retained</span></printer><span>regained</span></under><span>
    many cities which had fallen into the hands of the
    Lamanites.
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>And it came to pass in the
    sixty and first year of the reign of the judges they succeeded in
    </span><under>
     <printer><span>retaining</span></printer><span>regaining</span></under><span>
    even the half of all their possessions.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>11</verse><span>Now this great loss of the Nephites, and the great slaughter
    which was among them, would not have happened had it not been
    for their wickedness and their abomination which was among them;
    yea, and it was among those also who professed to belong to the
    church of God.
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>And it was because of the pride of their hearts, because of
    their exceeding riches, yea, it was because of their oppression
    to the poor, withholding their food from the hungry, withholding
    their clothing from the naked, and smiting their humble brethren
    upon the cheek, making a mock of that which was sacred, denying
    the spirit of prophecy and of revelation, murdering, plundering,
    lying, stealing, committing adultery, rising up in great
    contentions, and deserting away into the land of Nephi, among
    the Lamanites—</span><verse>13</verse><span>and because of this their great wickedness, and their boastings
    in their own strength, they were left in their own strength;
    therefore they did not prosper but were afflicted and smitten
    and driven before the Lamanites, until they had lost possession
    of almost all their lands.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>14</verse><span>But behold, Moronihah did preach many things unto the people
    because of their iniquity, and also Nephi and Lehi, who were the
    sons of Helaman, did preach many things unto the people, yea,
    and did prophesy many things unto them concerning their
    iniquities and what should come unto them if they did not repent
    of their sins.
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>And it came to pass that they did repent, and inasmuch as they
    did repent they did begin to prosper.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>16</verse><span>For when Moronihah saw that they did
    repent he did venture to lead them forth from place to place, and
    from city to city, even until they had
    </span><under>
     <printer><span>retained</span></printer><span>regained</span></under><span>
    the
    one-half of their property and the one-half of all their lands.
    </span><verse>17</verse><span>And thus ended the sixty and first year
    of the reign of the judges.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>18</verse><span>And it came to pass in the sixty and second year of the reign
    of the judges, that Moronihah could obtain no more possessions
    over the Lamanites.
    </span><verse>19</verse><span>Therefore they did abandon their design to obtain the remainder
    of their lands, for so numerous were the Lamanites that it
    became impossible for the Nephites to obtain more power over
    them; therefore Moronihah did employ all his armies in
    maintaining those parts which he had taken.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>20</verse><span>And it came to pass, because of the greatness of the number of
    the Lamanites the Nephites were in great fear, lest they should
    be overpowered, and trodden down, and slain, and destroyed.
    </span><verse>21</verse><span>Yea, they began to remember the prophecies of Alma, and also
    the words of Mosiah; and they saw that they had been a
    stiffnecked people, and that they had set at naught the
    commandments of God;
    </span><verse>22</verse><span>and that they had altered and trampled under their feet the
    laws of Mosiah, or that which the Lord commanded him to give
    unto the people; and they saw that their laws had become
    corrupted, and that they had become a wicked people, insomuch
    that they were wicked even like unto the Lamanites.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>23</verse><span>And because of their iniquity the church had begun to dwindle;
    and they began to disbelieve in the spirit of prophecy and in
    the spirit of revelation; and the judgments of God did stare
    them in the face.
    </span><verse>24</verse><span>And they saw that they had become weak, like unto their
    brethren, the Lamanites, and that the Spirit of the Lord did no
    more preserve them; yea, it had withdrawn from them because the
    Spirit of the Lord doth not dwell in unholy temples.
    </span><verse>25</verse><span>Therefore the Lord did cease to preserve them by his miraculous
    and matchless power, for they had fallen into a state of
    unbelief and awful wickedness.
   </span></block>

   <block><span>
    And they saw that the Lamanites were exceedingly more numerous
    than they, and except they should cleave unto the Lord their God
    they must unavoidably perish.
    </span><verse>26</verse><span>For
    behold, they saw that the strength of the Lamanites was as great
    as their strength, even man for man. And thus had they fallen into
    this great transgression; yea, thus had they become weak, because
    of their transgression, in the space of not many years.

    <verse>1</verse><span>And it came to pass that in this same year, behold, Nephi
    delivered up the judgment-seat to a man whose name was Cezoram.
    </span><verse>2</verse><span>For as their laws and their governments were established by the
    voice of the people, and they who chose evil were more numerous
    than they who chose good, therefore they were ripening for
    destruction, for the laws had become corrupted.
    </span><verse>3</verse><span>Yea, and this was not all; they were a stiffnecked people,
    insomuch that they could not be governed by the law nor justice,
    save it were to their destruction.
    </span><verse>4</verse><span>And it came to pass that Nephi had become weary because of
    their iniquity; and he yielded up the judgment-seat, and took it
    upon him to preach the word of God all the remainder of his
    days, and his brother Lehi also, all the remainder of his
    days.

      commandments of God; and I would that ye should declare unto the
      people these words.</span></block>

     <block><span>
      Behold, I have given unto you the names of our first parents who
      came out of the land of Jerusalem; and this I have done that when
      you remember your names ye may remember them; and when ye remember
      them ye may remember their works; and when ye remember their works
      ye may know how that it is said, and also written, that they were
      good.
      </span><verse>7</verse><span>Therefore, my sons, I would that
      ye should do that which is good, that it may be said of you, and
      also written, even as it has been said and written of them.
     </span></block>

     <block>
      <verse>8</verse><span>And now my sons, behold I have somewhat more to desire of you,
      which desire is, that ye may not do these things that ye may
      boast, but that ye may do these things to lay up for yourselves
      a treasure in heaven, yea, which is eternal, and which fadeth
      not away; yea, that ye may have that precious gift of eternal
      life, which we have reason to suppose hath been given to our
      fathers.
      </span><verse>9</verse><span>O remember, remember, my sons, the words which king Benjamin
      spake unto his people; yea, remember that there is no other way
      nor means whereby man can be saved, only through the atoning
      blood of Jesus Christ, who shall come; yea, remember that he
      cometh to redeem the world.
      </span><verse>10</verse><span>And remember also the words which Amulek spake unto Zeezrom, in
      the city of Ammonihah; for he said unto him that the Lord surely
      should come to redeem his people, but that he should not come to
      redeem them in their sins, but to redeem them from their sins.
      </span><verse>11</verse><span>And he hath power given unto him from the Father to redeem them
      from their sins because of repentance; therefore he hath sent
      his angels to declare the
      tidings of the conditions of repentance, which bringeth unto the
      power of the Redeemer, unto the salvation of their souls.
     </span></block>

     <block>
      <verse>12</verse><span>And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock
      of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must
      build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his
      mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all
      his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have
      no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and
      endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which

    </span><verse>8</verse><span>And it came to pass that the Lamanites did also go
    whithersoever they would, whether it were among the Lamanites or
    among the Nephites; and thus they did have free intercourse one

    their desire.

   <block>
    <verse>9</verse><span>And it came to pass that they became exceedingly rich, both the

   <block>
    <verse>10</verse><span>Now the land south was called Lehi and the land north was

    </span><verse>11</verse><span>And behold, there was all manner of gold in both these lands,
    and of silver, and of precious ore of every kind; and there were

    <verse>16</verse><span>And in the commencement of the sixty and seventh year the

    </span><verse>17</verse><span>For behold, the Lord had blessed them so long with the riches
    of the world that they had not been stirred up to anger, to
    wars, nor to bloodshed; therefore they began to set their hearts
    upon their riches; yea, they began to seek to get gain that they
    might be lifted up one above another; therefore they began to
    commit secret murders, and to rob and to plunder, that they
    might get gain.

    Gadianton’s band. But behold, they were more numerous among the
    more wicked part of the Lamanites. And they were called
    Gadianton’s robbers and murderers.
    </span><verse>19</verse><span>And it was they who did murder the chief judge Cezoram, and his

    the face of the earth.
    </span><verse>21</verse><span>But behold, Satan did stir up the hearts of the more part of
    the Nephites, insomuch that they did unite with those bands of
    robbers, and
    did enter into their covenants and their oaths, that they would
    protect and preserve one another in whatsoever difficult

    whatsoever wickedness his brother should do he should not be
    injured by his brother, nor by those who did belong to his band,

    the son of Helaman, returned to the land of Zarahemla from the

    doing no justice unto the children of men;
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>condemning the righteous because of their righteousness;
    letting the guilty and the wicked go unpunished because of their
    money; and moreover to be held in office at the head of
    government, to rule and do according to their wills, that they
    might get gain and glory of the world, and, moreover, that they
    might the more easily commit adultery, and steal, and kill, and

     <verse>7</verse><span>Oh, that I could have had my days in the days when my father
     Nephi first came out of the land of Jerusalem, that I could have

     to be entreated, firm to keep the commandments of God, and slow
     to be led to do iniquity; and they were quick to hearken unto
     the words of the Lord—</span><verse>8</verse><span>yea, if my days could have been in those days, then would my

    therefore, Nephi had bowed himself upon the tower which was in
    his garden, which tower was also near unto the garden gate by

      </span><verse>18</verse><span>Yea, and behold I say unto you, that Abraham not only knew of

      </span><verse>22</verse><span>Our father
      Lehi was driven out of Jerusalem because he testified of these

      of the coming of Christ, and have looked forward, and have
      rejoiced in his day which is to come.
      </span><verse>23</verse><span>And behold, he is God, and he is with

      <verse>24</verse><span>And now, seeing ye know these things and cannot deny them
      except ye shall lie, therefore in this ye have sinned, for ye
      have rejected all these things, notwithstanding so many

    <verse>17</verse><span>And it came to pass that in the seventy and sixth year the Lord
    did turn away his anger from the people, and caused that rain
    should fall upon the earth, insomuch that it did bring forth her
    fruit in the season of her fruit. And it came to pass that it
    did bring forth her grain in the season of her grain.
    </span><verse>18</verse><span>And behold, the people did rejoice and glorify God, and the
    whole face of the land was filled with rejoicing; and they did
    no more seek to destroy Nephi, but they did esteem him as a
    great prophet, and a man of God, having great power and
    authority given unto him from God.
    </span><verse>19</verse><span>And behold, Lehi, his brother, was not a whit behind him as to
    things pertaining to righteousness.

   <block>
    <verse>20</verse><span>And thus it did come to pass that the people of Nephi began to
    prosper again in the land, and began to build up their waste
    places, and began to multiply and spread, even until they did
    cover the whole face of the land, both on the northward and on
    the southward, from the sea west to the sea east.
    </span><verse>21</verse><span>And it came to pass that the seventy and sixth year did end in
    peace. And the seventy and seventh year began in peace; and the
    church did spread throughout the face of all the land; and the
    more part of the people, both the Nephites and the Lamanites,
    did belong to the church; and they did have exceedingly great
    peace in the land; and thus ended the seventy and seventh
    year.

    <verse>22</verse><span>And also they had peace in the seventy and eighth year, save it
    were a few contentions concerning the points of doctrine which
    had been laid down by the prophets.
    </span><verse>23</verse><span>And in the seventy and ninth year there began to be much
    strife. But it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi, and many of
    their brethren who knew concerning the true points of doctrine,
    having many revelations daily, therefore they did preach unto
    the people, insomuch that they did put an end to their strife in

    Gadiantons in the wilderness
   </span></heading>

   <block>
    <verse>24</verse><span>And it came to pass that in the eightieth year of the reign of
    the judges over the people of Nephi, there were a certain number
    of the dissenters from the people of Nephi, who had some years
    before gone over unto the Lamanites, and taken upon themselves
    the name of Lamanites, and also a certain number who were real
    descendants of the Lamanites, being stirred up to anger by them,
    or by those dissenters, therefore they commenced a war with
    their brethren.
    </span><verse>25</verse><span>And they did commit murder and plunder; and then they would
    retreat back into the mountains, and into the wilderness and
    secret places, hiding themselves that they could not be
    discovered, receiving daily an addition to their numbers,
    inasmuch as there were dissenters that went forth unto them.
    </span><verse>26</verse><span>And thus in time, yea, even in the space of not many years,
    they became an exceedingly great band of robbers; and they did
    search out all the secret plans of Gadianton; and thus they
    became robbers of Gadianton.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>27</verse><span>Now behold, these robbers did make great havoc, yea, even great
    destruction among the people of Nephi, and also among the people
    of the Lamanites.
    </span><verse>28</verse><span>And it came to pass that it was expedient that there should be
    a stop put to this work of destruction; therefore they sent an
    army of strong men into the wilderness and upon the mountains to
    search out this band of robbers, and to destroy them.
    </span><verse>29</verse><span>But behold, it came to pass that in that same year they were
    driven back even into their own lands. And thus ended the
    eightieth year of the reign of the judges over the people of
    Nephi.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>30</verse><span>And it came to pass in the commencement of the eighty and first
    year they did go forth again against this band of robbers, and
    did destroy many; and they were also visited with much
    destruction.
    </span><verse>31</verse><span>And they were again obliged to return out of the wilderness and
    out of the mountains unto their own lands, because of the
    exceeding greatness of the numbers of those robbers who infested
    the mountains and the wilderness.
    </span><verse>32</verse><span>And it came to pass that thus ended this year.
   </span></block>

   <block><span>
    And the robbers did still increase and wax strong, insomuch that
    they did defy the whole armies of the Nephites, and also of the
    Lamanites; and they did cause great fear to come unto the people
    upon all the face of the land.
    </span><verse>33</verse><span>Yea, for
    they did visit many parts of the land, and did do great
    destruction unto them; yea, did kill many, and did carry away
    others captive into the wilderness, yea, and more especially their
    women and their children.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>34</verse><span>Now this great evil, which came unto the people because of
    their iniquity, did stir them up again in remembrance of the

    </span><verse>35</verse><span>And thus ended the eighty and first year of the reign of the
    judges.
    </span><verse>36</verse><span>And in the eighty and second year they began again to forget
    the Lord their God. And in the eighty and third year they began
    to wax strong in iniquity. And in the eighty and fourth year
    they did not mend their ways.
    </span><verse>37</verse><span>And it came to pass in the eighty and fifth year they did wax
    stronger and stronger in their pride, and in their wickedness;
    and thus they were ripening again for destruction.

   <verse>1</verse><span>And now, it came to pass that there were many who heard the words
   of Samuel, the Lamanite, which he spake upon the walls of the city.
   And as many as believed on his word went forth and sought for Nephi;
   and when they had come forth and found him they confessed unto him
   their sins and denied not, desiring that they might be baptized unto
   the Lord.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>2</verse><span>But as many as there were who did not believe in the words of
   Samuel were angry with him; and they cast stones at him upon the
   wall, and also many shot arrows at him as he stood upon the wall;
   but the Spirit of the Lord was with him, insomuch that they could
   not hit him with their stones neither with their arrows.
   </span><verse>3</verse><span>Now when they saw that they could not hit him, there were many more
   who did believe on his words, insomuch that they went away unto
   Nephi to be baptized.
  </span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>4</verse><span>For behold, Nephi was baptizing, and prophesying, and preaching,
   crying repentance unto the people, showing signs and wonders,
   working miracles among the people, that they might know that the
   Christ must shortly come—</span><verse>5</verse><span>telling them of things which must shortly come, that they might
   know and remember at the time of their coming that they had been
   made known unto them beforehand, to the intent that they might
   believe; therefore as many as believed on the words of Samuel went
   forth unto him to be baptized, for they came repenting and
   confessing their sins.

  <block>
   <verse>6</verse><span>But the more part of them did not believe in the words of Samuel;
   therefore when they saw that they could not hit him with their

   saying:</span><quote><span>
    Take this fellow and bind him, for behold he hath a devil; and because
    of the power of the devil which is in him we cannot hit him with our

   among his own people.
   </span><verse>8</verse><span>And behold, he was never heard of more among the Nephites.

     </span><verse>19</verse><span>Yea, why will he not show himself in this land as well as in the
     land of Jerusalem?</span></block>

    <block>
     <verse>20</verse><span>But behold, we know that this is a wicked tradition, which has been
     handed down unto us by our fathers, to cause us that we should
     believe in some great and marvelous thing which should come to pass,
     but not among us, but in a land which is far distant, a land which
     we know not; therefore they can keep us in ignorance, for we cannot
     witness with our own eyes that they are true.
     </span><verse>21</verse><span>And they will, by the cunning and the mysterious arts of the evil
     one, work some great mystery which we cannot understand, which will
     keep us down to be servants to their words, and also servants unto
     them, for we depend upon them to teach us the word; and thus will
