            An account of Lehi and his wife Sariah and his four sons, being called, (beginning at the eldest)
            Laman, Lemuel, Sam, and Nephi. The Lord warns Lehi to depart out of the land of Jerusalem,
            because he prophesieth unto the people concerning their iniquity and they seek to destroy his life.
            He taketh three days’ journey into the wilderness with his family. Nephi taketh his brethren and
            returneth to the land of Jerusalem after the record of the Jews. The account of their sufferings. They
            take the daughters of Ishmael to wife. They take their families and depart into the wilderness.
            Their sufferings and afflictions in the wilderness. The course of their travels. They come to the
            large waters. Nephi’s brethren rebel against him. He confoundeth them, and buildeth a ship. They
            call the name of the place Bountiful. They cross the large waters into the promised land, and so
            forth. This is according to the account of Nephi; or in other words, I, Nephi, wrote this record.

        <verse>1</verse><span>I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents, therefore I was taught
        somewhat in all the learning of my father; and having seen many
        afflictions in the course of my days, nevertheless, having been highly
        favored of the Lord in all my days; yea, having had a great knowledge of
        the goodness and the mysteries of God, therefore I make a record of my
        proceedings in my days.
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>Yea, I make a record in the language of my father, which consists of
        the learning of the Jews and the language of the Egyptians.
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>And I know that the record which I make is true; and I make it with
        mine own hand; and I make it according to my knowledge.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>4</verse><span>For it came to pass in the commencement of the first year of the reign
        of Zedekiah, king of Judah, (my father, Lehi, having dwelt at Jerusalem
        in all his days); and in that same year there came many prophets,
        prophesying unto the people that they must repent, or the great city
        Jerusalem must be destroyed.
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>Wherefore it came to pass that my father, Lehi, as he went forth prayed
        unto the Lord, yea, even with all his heart, in behalf of his
        people.
        </span><verse>6</verse><span>And it came to pass as he prayed unto the Lord, there came a pillar of
        fire and dwelt upon a rock before him; and he saw and heard much; and
        because of the things which he saw and heard he did quake and tremble
        exceedingly.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>7</verse><span>And it came to pass that he returned to his own house at Jerusalem; and
        he cast himself upon his bed, being overcome with the Spirit and the
        things which he had seen.
        </span><verse>8</verse><span>And being thus overcome with the Spirit, he was carried away in a
        vision, even that he saw the heavens open, and he thought he saw God
        sitting upon his throne, surrounded with numberless concourses of angels
        in the attitude of singing and praising their God.
        </span><verse>9</verse><span>And it came to pass that he saw one descending out of the midst of
        heaven, and he beheld that his luster was above that of the sun at
        noon-day.
        </span><verse>10</verse><span>And he also saw twelve others following him, and their brightness did
        exceed that of the stars in the firmament.
        </span><verse>11</verse><span>And they came down and went forth upon the face of the earth; and the
        first came and stood before my father, and gave unto him a book, and
        bade him that he should read.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>12</verse><span>And it came to pass that as he read, he was filled with the Spirit of
        the Lord.
        </span><verse>13</verse><span>And he read, saying, “Wo, wo unto Jerusalem, for I have seen thine
        abominations!” Yea, and many things did my father read concerning
        Jerusalem—that it should be destroyed, and the inhabitants thereof; many
        should perish by the sword, and many should be carried away captive into
        Babylon.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>14</verse><span>And it came to pass that when my father had read and seen many great
        and marvelous things, he did exclaim many things unto the Lord; such
        as:
        </span><quote>
            <block><span>
                Great and marvelous are thy works, O Lord God Almighty!
            </span></block>

            <block><span>
                Thy throne is high in the heavens,</span><break></break>
                <indent><span>and thy power, and goodness, and mercy are over all the inhabitants of the earth;</span></indent><span>
                and, because thou art merciful,</span><break></break>
                <indent><span>thou wilt not suffer those who come unto thee that they shall perish!</span></indent>
            </block>

        </quote>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>15</verse><span>And after this manner was the language of my father in the praising of
        his God; for his soul did rejoice, and his whole heart was filled,
        because of the things which he had seen, yea, which the Lord had shown
        unto him.

            <block>
                <verse>16</verse><span>And now I, Nephi, do not make a full account of the things which my
                father hath written, for he hath written many things which he saw in
                visions and in dreams; and he also hath written many things which he
                prophesied and spake unto his children, of which I shall not make a full
                account.
                </span><verse>17</verse><span>But I shall make an account of my proceedings in my days. Behold, I
                make an abridgment of the record of my father, upon plates which I have
                made with mine own hands; wherefore, after I have abridged the record of
                my father then will I make an account of mine own life.

        <verse>18</verse><span>Therefore, I would that ye should know, that after the Lord had shown
        so many marvelous things unto my father, Lehi, yea, concerning the
        destruction of Jerusalem, behold he went forth among the people, and
        began to prophesy and to declare unto them concerning the things which
        he had both seen and heard.
        </span><verse>19</verse><span>And it came to pass that the Jews did mock him because of the things
        which he testified of them; for he truly testified of their wickedness
        and their abominations; and he testified that the things which he saw
        and heard, and also the things which he read in the book, manifested
        plainly of the coming of a Messiah, and also the redemption of the
        world.
        </span><verse>20</verse><span>And when the Jews heard these things they were angry with him; yea,
        even as with the prophets of old, whom they had cast out, and stoned,
        and slain; and they also sought his life, that they might take it
        away.

        But behold, I, Nephi, will show unto you that the tender mercies of the
        Lord are over all those whom he hath chosen, because of their faith, to
        make them mighty even unto the power of deliverance.

        </span><verse>1</verse><span>For behold, it came to pass that the Lord spake unto my father, yea,
        even in a dream, and said unto him:
        </span><quote><span>
            Blessed art thou Lehi, because of the things which thou hast done. And
            because thou hast been faithful and declared unto this people the things
            which I commanded thee, behold, they seek to take away thy life.

        <verse>2</verse><span>And it came to pass that the Lord commanded my father, even in a dream,
        that he should take his family and depart into the wilderness.

        Flight into the wilderness

    <block>
        <verse>3</verse><span>And it came to pass that he was obedient unto the word of the Lord,
        wherefore he did as the Lord commanded him.
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>And it came to pass that he departed into the wilderness. And he left
        his house, and the land of his inheritance, and his gold, and his
        silver, and his precious things, and took nothing with him, save it were
        his family, and provisions, and tents, and departed into the wilderness.
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>And he came down by the borders near the shore of the Red Sea; and he
        traveled in the wilderness in the borders which are nearer the Red Sea;
        and he did travel in the wilderness with his family, which consisted of
        my mother, Sariah, and my elder brothers, who were Laman, Lemuel, and
        Sam.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>6</verse><span>And it came to pass that when he had traveled three days in the
        wilderness, he pitched his tent in a valley by the side of a river of
        water.
        </span><verse>7</verse><span>And it came to pass that he built an altar of stones, and made an
        offering unto the Lord, and gave thanks unto the Lord our God.
        </span><verse>8</verse><span>And it came to pass that he called the name of the river, Laman, and it
        emptied into the Red Sea; and the valley was in the borders near the
        mouth thereof.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>9</verse><span>And when my father saw that the waters of the river emptied into the
        fountain of the Red Sea, he spake unto Laman, saying:</span><quote><span>
            O that thou mightest be like unto this river,</span><break></break>
            <indent><span>continually running into the fountain of all righteousness!</span></indent>
        </quote>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>10</verse><span>And he also spake unto Lemuel:</span><quote><span>
            O that thou mightest be like unto this valley,</span><break></break>
            <indent><span>firm and steadfast, and immovable in keeping the commandments of the Lord!</span></indent>
        </quote>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>11</verse><span>Now this he spake because of the stiffneckedness of Laman and Lemuel;
        for behold they did murmur in many things against their father, because
        he was a visionary man, and had led them out of the land of Jerusalem,
        to leave the land of their inheritance, and their gold, and their
        silver, and their precious things, to perish in the wilderness. And this
        they said he had done because of the foolish imaginations of his heart.
        </span><verse>12</verse><span>And thus Laman and Lemuel, being the eldest, did murmur against their
        father. And they did murmur because they knew not the dealings of that
        God who had created them.
        </span><verse>13</verse><span>Neither did they believe that Jerusalem, that great city, could be
        destroyed according to the words of the prophets. And they were like
        unto the Jews who were at Jerusalem, who sought to take away the life of
        my father.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>14</verse><span>And it came to pass that my father did speak unto them in the valley of
        Lemuel, with power, being filled with the Spirit, until their frames did
        shake before him. And he did confound them, that they durst not utter
        against him; wherefore, they did as he commanded them.
        </span><verse>15</verse><span>And my father dwelt in a tent.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>16</verse><span>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, being exceedingly young,
        nevertheless being large in stature, and also having great desires to
        know of the mysteries of God, wherefore, I did cry unto the Lord; and
        behold he did visit me, and did soften my heart that I did believe all
        the words which had been spoken by my father; wherefore, I did not rebel
        against him like unto my brothers.
        </span><verse>17</verse><span>And I spake unto Sam, making known unto him the things which the Lord
        had manifested unto me by his Holy Spirit. And it came to pass that he
        believed in my words.
        </span><verse>18</verse><span>But, behold, Laman and Lemuel would not hearken unto my words; and
        being grieved because of the hardness of their hearts I cried unto the
        Lord for them.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>19</verse><span>And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto me, saying:
        </span><quote>
            <block><span>
                Blessed art thou, Nephi, because of thy faith,</span><break></break>
                <indent><span>for thou hast sought me diligently, with lowliness of heart.</span></indent>
                <verse>20</verse><span>And inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments,</span><break></break>
                <indent><span>ye shall prosper, and shall be led to a land of promise;</span></indent><span>

                manner of riches. And all this he hath done because of the commandments of
                the Lord.
                </span><verse>17</verse><span>For he knew that Jerusalem must be
                destroyed, because of the wickedness of the people.

        the house of Laban.

        would give unto us the records which were engraven upon the plates of
        brass, for which we would give unto him our gold, and our silver, and
        all our precious things.
        </span><verse>25</verse><span>And it came to pass that when Laban saw our property, and that it was
        exceedingly great, he did lust after it, insomuch that he thrust us out,
        and sent his servants to slay us, that he might obtain our property.
        </span><verse>26</verse><span>And it came to pass that we did flee before the servants of Laban, and
        we were obliged to leave behind our property, and it fell into the hands

        <verse>4</verse><span>Now when I had spoken these words, they were yet wroth, and did still
        continue to murmur; nevertheless they did follow me up until we came
        without the walls of Jerusalem.
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>And it was by night; and I caused that they should hide themselves
        without the walls.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        And after they had hid themselves, I, Nephi, crept into the city and went
        forth towards the house of Laban.
        </span><verse>6</verse><span>And I was led
        by the Spirit, not knowing beforehand the things which I should do.
        </span><verse>7</verse><span>Nevertheless I went forth, and as I came near
        unto the house of Laban I beheld a man, and he had fallen to the earth
        before me, for he was drunken with wine.
        </span><verse>8</verse><span>And
        when I came to him I found that it was Laban.
        </span><verse>9</verse><span>And I beheld his sword, and I drew it forth from
        the sheath thereof; and the hilt thereof was of pure gold, and the
        workmanship thereof was exceedingly fine, and I saw that the blade thereof
        was of the most precious steel.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>10</verse><span>And it came to pass that I was constrained by the Spirit that I should
        kill Laban; but I said in my heart, “Never at any time have I shed the

        <verse>11</verse><span>And the Spirit said unto me again:</span><quote><span>
            Behold the Lord hath delivered him into thy hands.

        Yea, and I also knew that he had sought to take away mine own life; yea,
        and he would not hearken unto the commandments of the Lord; and he also
        had taken away our property.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>12</verse><span>And it came to pass that the Spirit said unto me again:</span><quote><span>
            Slay him, for the Lord hath delivered him into thy hands;
            </span><verse>13</verse><span>behold the Lord slayeth the wicked to bring

        <verse>15</verse><span>Yea, and I also thought that they could not keep the commandments of

    <block>
        <verse>18</verse><span>Therefore I did obey the voice of the Spirit, and took Laban by the

        </span><verse>19</verse><span>And after I had smitten off his head with his own sword, I took the
        garments of Laban and put them upon mine own body; yea, even every whit;
        and I did gird on his armor about my loins.
        </span><verse>20</verse><span>And after I had done this, I went forth unto the treasury of

        And as I went forth towards the treasury of Laban, behold, I saw the

        </span><verse>21</verse><span>And he supposed me to be his master, Laban, for
        he beheld the garments and also the sword girded about my loins.
        </span><verse>22</verse><span>And he spake unto me
        concerning the elders of the Jews, he knowing that his master, Laban, had
        been out by night among them.
        </span><verse>23</verse><span>And I spake unto
        him as if it had been Laban.
        </span><verse>24</verse><span>And I also spake
        unto him that I should carry the engravings, which were upon the plates of
        brass, to my elder brethren, who were without the walls.
        </span><verse>25</verse><span>And I also bade him that he should follow me.

        <verse>26</verse><span>And he, supposing that I spake of the brethren of the church, and that
        I was truly that Laban whom I had slain, wherefore he did follow me.
        </span><verse>27</verse><span>And he spake unto me many times concerning the elders of the Jews, as I
        went forth unto my brethren, who were without the walls.

        <verse>28</verse><span>And it came to pass that when Laman saw me he was exceedingly

        had sought to take away their lives also.
        </span><verse>29</verse><span>And it came to pass that I called after them, and they did hear me;

        </span><verse>31</verse><span>And now I, Nephi, being a man large in stature, and also having
        received much strength of the Lord, therefore I did seize upon the

        </span><verse>33</verse><span>And I spake unto him, even with an oath, that he need not fear; that he

                The Lord God surely shall visit all the house of Israel at that day, some
                with his voice, because of their righteousness, unto their great joy and
                salvation, and others with the thunderings and the lightnings of his
                power, by tempest, by fire, and by smoke, and vapor of darkness, and by
                the opening of the earth, and by mountains which shall be carried up.
                </span><verse>12</verse><span>And all these things must surely come, saith
                the prophet Zenos. And the rocks of the earth must rend; and because of
                the groanings of the earth, many of the kings of the isles of the sea
                shall be wrought upon by the Spirit of God to exclaim, “The God of nature

                are built up to get power over the flesh, and those who are built up
                to become popular in the eyes of the world, and those who seek the
                lusts of the flesh and the things of the world, and to do all manner
                of iniquity; yea, in fine, all those who belong to the kingdom of the
                devil are they who need fear, and tremble, and quake; they are those
                who must be brought low in the dust; they are those who must be
                consumed as stubble; and this is according to the words of the
                prophet.
