  <bookheading><span>
   An account written by the hand of Mormon
  </span></bookheading>
  <bookheading><span>
   upon plates taken from the plates of Nephi
  </span></bookheading>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  Wherefore, it is an abridgment of the record of the people of Nephi, and
  also of the Lamanites
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  Written to the Lamanites, who are a remnant of the house of Israel; and
  also to Jew and Gentile
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  Written by way of commandment, and also by the spirit of prophecy and of
  revelation
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  Written and sealed up, and hid up unto the Lord, that they
  might not be destroyed</span></block>

 <block><span>
  To come forth by the gift and power of God unto the
  interpretation thereof</span></block>

 <block><span>
  Sealed by the hand of Moroni, and hid up unto the Lord, to come forth in
  due time by way of the Gentile
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  The interpretation thereof by the gift of God.
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  An abridgment taken from the Book of Ether also, which is a record of the
  people of Jared, who were scattered at the time the Lord confounded the
  language of the people, when they were building a tower to get to heaven
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  Which is to show unto the remnant of the house of Israel what great things
  the Lord hath done for their fathers; and that they may know the covenants
  of the Lord, that they are not cast off forever
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  And also to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the
  Christ, the Eternal God, manifesting himself unto all nations
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  And now, if there are faults they are the mistakes of men; wherefore,
  condemn not the things of God, that ye may be found spotless at the
  judgment-seat of Christ.
