  <verse>1</verse><span>Now behold, I, Jarom, write a few words according to the
  commandment of my father, Enos, that our genealogy may be kept.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And as these plates are small, and as these things are written for
  the intent of the benefit of our brethren the Lamanites, wherefore,
  it must needs be that I write a little; but I shall not write the
  things of my prophesying, nor of my revelations. For what could I
  write more than my fathers have written? For have not they revealed
  the plan of salvation? I say unto you yea, and this sufficeth
  me.

  <verse>3</verse><span>Behold, it is expedient that much should be done among this people,
  because of the hardness of their hearts, and the deafness of their
  ears, and the blindness of their minds, and the stiffness of their
  necks; nevertheless, God is exceedingly merciful unto them, and has
  not as yet swept them off from the face of the land.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And there are many among us who have many revelations, for they are
  not all stiffnecked. And as many as are not stiffnecked and have
  faith, have communion with the Holy Spirit, which maketh manifest
  unto the children of men, according to their faith.

  <verse>5</verse><span>And now, behold, two hundred years had passed away, and the people
  of Nephi had waxed strong in the land. They observed to keep the law
  of Moses and the sabbath day holy unto the Lord. And they profaned
  not; neither did they blaspheme. And the laws of the land were
  exceedingly strict.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And they were scattered upon much of the face of the land, and the
  Lamanites also. And they were exceedingly more numerous than were
  they of the Nephites; and they loved murder and would drink the
  blood of beasts.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And it came to pass that they came many times against us, the
  Nephites, to battle. But our kings and our leaders were mighty men
  in the faith of the Lord; and they taught the people the ways of the
  Lord; wherefore, we withstood the Lamanites and swept them away out
  of our lands, and began to fortify our cities, or whatsoever place
  of our inheritance.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>And we multiplied exceedingly, and spread upon the face of the
  land, and became exceedingly rich in gold, and in silver, and in
  precious things, and in fine workmanship of wood, in buildings, and
  in machinery, and also in iron and copper, and brass and steel,
  making all manner of tools of every kind to till the ground, and
  weapons of war—yea, the sharp pointed arrow, and the quiver, and the
  dart, and the javelin, and all preparations for war.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>And thus being prepared to meet the Lamanites, they did not prosper
  against us. But the word of the Lord was verified, which he spake
  unto our fathers, saying that, “Inasmuch as ye will keep my
  commandments ye shall prosper in the land.”

  <verse>10</verse><span>And it came to pass that the prophets of the Lord did threaten the
  people of Nephi, according to the word of God, that if they did not
  keep the commandments, but should fall into transgression, they
  should be destroyed from off the face of the land.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>Wherefore, the prophets, and the priests, and the teachers, did
  labor diligently, exhorting with all long- suffering the people to
  diligence; teaching the law of Moses, and the intent for which it
  was given; persuading them to look forward unto the Messiah, and
  believe in him to come as though he already was. And after this
  manner did they teach them.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And it came to pass that by so doing they kept them from being
  destroyed upon the face of the land; for they did prick their hearts
  with the word, continually stirring them up unto repentance.

  <verse>13</verse><span>And it came to pass that two hundred and thirty and eight years had
  passed away—after the manner of wars, and contentions, and
  dissensions, for the space of much of the time.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And I, Jarom, do not write more, for the plates are small. But
  behold, my brethren, ye can go to the other plates of Nephi; for
  behold, upon them the records of our wars are engraven, according to
  the writings of the kings, or those which they caused to be
  written.

  <verse>15</verse><span>And I deliver these plates into the hands of my son Omni, that they
  may be kept according to the commandments of my fathers.
