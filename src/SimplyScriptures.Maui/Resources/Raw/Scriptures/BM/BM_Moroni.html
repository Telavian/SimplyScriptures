 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Now I, Moroni, after having made an end of abridging the account of the
  people of Jared, I had supposed not to have written more, but I have not
  as yet perished; and I make not myself known to the Lamanites lest they
  should destroy me.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>For behold, their wars are exceedingly fierce among themselves; and
  because of their hatred they put to death every Nephite that will not
  deny the Christ.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And I, Moroni, will not deny the Christ; wherefore, I wander
  whithersoever I can for the safety of mine own life.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Wherefore, I write a few more things, contrary to that which I had
  supposed; for I had supposed not to have written any more; but I write a
  few more things, that perhaps they may be of worth unto my brethren, the
  Lamanites, in some future day, according to the will of the Lord.

  Giving the Holy Ghost
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>2
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>The words of Christ, which he spake unto his disciples, the twelve whom
  he had chosen, as he laid his hands upon them—</span><verse>2</verse><span>and he called them by name, saying:</span><quote><span>
   Ye shall call on the Father in my name, in mighty prayer; and after ye
   have done this ye shall have power that to him upon whom ye shall lay your
   hands, ye shall give the Holy Ghost; and in my name shall ye give it, for
   thus do mine apostles.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>Now Christ spake these words unto them at the time of his first
  appearing; and the multitude heard it not, but the disciples heard it;
  and on as many as they laid their hands, fell the Holy Ghost.

  Ordaining

 <chapter>3
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>The manner which the disciples, who were called the elders of the
  church, ordained priests and teachers.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>After they had prayed unto the Father in the name of Christ, they laid
  their hands upon them, and said:</span><quote>
   <verse>3</verse><span>In the name of Jesus Christ I ordain you to be a priest, (or if he be a
   teacher, I ordain you to be a teacher), to preach repentance and
   remission of sins through Jesus Christ, by the endurance of faith on his
   name to the end. Amen.</span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>And after this manner did they ordain priests and teachers, according
  to the gifts and callings of God unto men; and they ordained them by the
  power of the Holy Ghost, which was in them.

  Administering the flesh and blood of Christ

 <chapter>4
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>The manner of their elders and priests administering the flesh and
  blood of Christ unto the church; and they administered it according to
  the commandments of Christ; wherefore we know the manner to be
  true.
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  And the elder or priest did minister it.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And
  they did kneel down with the church, and pray to the Father in the name of
  Christ, saying:
  </span><quote>
   <verse>3</verse><span>O God, the Eternal Father, we ask thee in the name of thy Son, Jesus
   Christ, to bless and sanctify this bread to the souls of all those who
   partake of it; that they may eat in remembrance of the body of thy Son,
   and witness unto thee, O God, the Eternal Father, that they are willing
   to take upon them the name of thy Son, and always remember him, and keep
   his commandments which he hath given them, that they may always have his
   Spirit to be with them. Amen.</span></quote>

 <chapter>5

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>The manner of administering the wine. Behold, they took the cup, and

   Christ, to bless and sanctify this wine to the souls of all those who
   drink of it, that they may do it in remembrance of the blood of thy Son,

  Baptizing
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>6</chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And now I speak concerning baptism.
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  Behold, elders, priests, and teachers were baptized; and they were not
  baptized save they
  brought forth fruit meet that they were worthy of it.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>Neither did they receive any unto baptism save
  they came forth with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, and witnessed
  unto the church that they truly repented of all their sins.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And none were received unto baptism save they
  took upon them the name of Christ, having a determination to serve him to
  the end.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>And after they had been received unto baptism, and were wrought upon
  and cleansed by the power of the Holy Ghost, they were numbered among
  the people of the church of Christ; and their names were taken, that
  they might be remembered and nourished by the good word of God, to keep
  them in the right way, to keep them continually watchful unto prayer,
  relying alone upon the merits of Christ, who was the author and the
  finisher of their faith.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>Meetings
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>And the church did meet together oft, to fast and to pray, and to speak
  one with another concerning the welfare of their souls.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And they did meet together oft to partake of bread and wine, in
  remembrance of the Lord Jesus.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And they were strict to observe that there should be no iniquity among
  them; and whoso was found to commit iniquity, and three witnesses of the
  church did condemn them before the elders, and if they repented not, and
  confessed not, their names were blotted out, and they were not numbered
  among the people of Christ.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>But as oft as they repented and sought forgiveness, with real intent,
  they were forgiven.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>And their meetings were conducted by the church after the manner of the
  workings of the Spirit, and by the power of the Holy Ghost; for as the
  power of the Holy Ghost led them whether to preach, or to exhort, or to
  pray, or to supplicate, or to sing, even so it was done.

  WORDS OF MORMON

 <blockheading><span>
  FAITH, HOPE, AND CHARITY
 </span></blockheading>
 <chapter>7
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And now I, Moroni, write a few of the words of my father Mormon, which
  he spake concerning faith, hope, and charity; for after this manner did
  he speak unto the people, as he taught them in the synagogue which they
  had built for the place of worship.
  </span><quote>
   <block>
    <verse>2</verse><span>And now I, Mormon, speak unto you, my beloved brethren; and it is by
    the grace of God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, and his holy
    will, because of the gift of his calling unto me, that I am permitted to
    speak unto you at this time.
    </span><verse>3</verse><span>Wherefore, I would speak unto you that are of the church, that are the
    peaceable followers of Christ, and that have obtained a sufficient hope by which ye can enter
    into the rest of the Lord, from this time henceforth until ye shall rest
    with him in heaven.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>4</verse><span>And now my brethren, I judge these things of you because of your
    peaceable walk with the children of men.
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>For I remember the word of God which saith by their works ye shall know
    them; for if their works be good, then they are good also.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>6</verse><span>For behold, God hath said a man being evil cannot do that which is
    good; for if he offereth a gift, or prayeth unto God, except he shall do
    it with real intent it profiteth him nothing.
    </span><verse>7</verse><span>For behold, it is not counted unto him for righteousness.
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>For behold, if a man being evil giveth a gift, he doeth it grudgingly;
    wherefore it is counted unto him the same as if he had retained the
    gift; wherefore he is counted evil before God.
    </span><verse>9</verse><span>And likewise also is it counted evil unto a man, if he shall pray and
    not with real intent of heart; yea, and it profiteth him nothing, for
    God receiveth none such.
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>Wherefore, a man being evil cannot do that which is good; neither will
    he give a good gift.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>11</verse><span>For behold, a bitter fountain cannot bring forth good water;</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>neither can a good fountain bring forth bitter water;</span></indent><span>
    wherefore, a man being a servant of the devil cannot follow Christ;</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and if he follow Christ he cannot be a servant of the devil.</span></indent>
    <verse>12</verse><span>Wherefore, all things which are good cometh of God;</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and that which is evil cometh of the devil;</span></indent><span>
    for the devil is an enemy unto God, and fighteth against him continually,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and inviteth and enticeth to sin, and to do that which is evil continually.</span></indent>
    <verse>13</verse><span>But behold, that which is of God inviteth and enticeth to do good continually;</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>wherefore, every thing which inviteth and enticeth to do good, and to love God,</span></indent>
    <indent><span>and to serve him, is inspired of God.</span></indent>
    <verse>14</verse><span>Wherefore, take heed, my beloved brethren,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>that ye do not judge that which is evil to be of God,</span></indent>
    <indent><span>or that which is good and of God to be of the devil.</span></indent>

  The way to judge
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <quote>
   <block>
    <verse>15</verse><span>For behold, my brethren, it is given unto you to judge, that ye may
    know good from evil; and the way to judge is as plain, that ye may know
    with a perfect knowledge, as the daylight is from the dark night.
    </span><verse>16</verse><span>For behold, the Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that he may
    know good from evil; wherefore, I show unto you the way to judge.</span></block>

   <block><span>
    For every thing which inviteth to do good, and to persuade to believe in
    Christ, is sent forth by the power and gift of Christ; wherefore ye may
    know with a perfect knowledge it is of God.
    </span><verse>17</verse><span>But
    whatsoever thing persuadeth men to do evil, and believe not in Christ, and
    deny him, and serve not God, then ye may know with a perfect knowledge it
    is of the devil; for after this manner doth the devil work, for he
    persuadeth no man to do good, no, not one; neither do his angels; neither
    do they who subject themselves unto him.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>18</verse><span>And now, my brethren, seeing that ye know the light by which ye may
    judge, which light is the light of Christ, see that ye do not judge
    wrongfully; for with that same judgment which ye judge ye shall also be
    judged.
    </span><verse>19</verse><span>Wherefore, I beseech of you, brethren, that ye should search diligently
    in the light of Christ that ye may know good from evil; and if ye will
    lay hold upon every good thing, and condemn it not, ye certainly will be
    a child of Christ.</span></block>

  Faith
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <quote>
   <block>
    <verse>20</verse><span>And now, my brethren, how is it possible that ye can lay hold upon
    every good thing?
    </span><verse>21</verse><span>And now I come to that faith, of which I said I would speak; and I will
    tell you the way whereby ye may lay hold on every good thing.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>22</verse><span>For behold, God knowing all things, being from everlasting to
    everlasting, behold, he sent angels to minister unto the children of
    men, to make manifest concerning the coming of Christ; and in Christ
    there should come every good thing.
    </span><verse>23</verse><span>And God also declared unto prophets, by his own mouth, that Christ
    should come.
    </span><verse>24</verse><span>And behold, there were divers ways that he did manifest things unto the
    children of men, which were good; and all things which are good cometh
    of Christ; otherwise men were fallen, and there could no good thing come
    unto them.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>25</verse><span>Wherefore, by the ministering of angels and by every word which
    proceeded forth out of the mouth of God, men began to exercise faith in
    Christ; and thus by faith they did lay hold upon every good thing; and
    thus it was until the coming of Christ.
    </span><verse>26</verse><span>And after that he came men also were saved by faith in his name; and by
    faith they become the sons of God.</span></block>

   <block><span>
    And as surely as Christ liveth he spake these words unto our fathers,
    saying:
    </span><quote><span>Whatsoever thing ye shall ask the Father in my name, which is
    good, in faith believing that ye shall receive, behold, it shall be done
    unto you.</span></quote>
   </block>

   <block>
    <verse>27</verse><span>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, have miracles ceased because Christ
    hath ascended into heaven and hath sat down on the right hand of God, to
    claim of the Father his rights of mercy which he hath upon the children
    of men?
    </span><verse>28</verse><span>For he hath answered the ends of the law and he claimeth all those who
    have faith in him; and they who have faith in him will cleave unto every
    good thing; wherefore he advocateth the cause of the children of men;
    and he dwelleth eternally in the heavens.
    </span><verse>29</verse><span>And because he hath done this, my beloved brethren, have miracles
    ceased? Behold I say unto you nay.</span></block>

   <block><span>Neither have angels ceased to minister unto the children of men.
    </span><verse>30</verse><span>For behold, they are subject unto him, to
    minister according to the word of his command, showing themselves unto
    them of strong faith and a firm mind in every form of godliness.
    </span><verse>31</verse><span>And the office of their ministry is to call men unto repentance, and to
    fulfil and to do the work of the covenants of the Father which he hath
    made unto the children of men, to prepare the way among the children of
    men, by declaring the word of Christ unto the chosen vessels of the
    Lord, that they may bear testimony of him.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>32</verse><span>And by so doing, the Lord God prepareth the way that the residue of men
    may have faith in Christ, that the Holy Ghost may have place in their
    hearts, according to the power thereof; and after this manner bringeth
    to pass the Father, the covenants which he hath made unto the children
    of men.
    </span><verse>33</verse><span>And Christ hath said:</span><quote><span>
     If ye will have faith in me ye shall have power to do whatsoever thing is
     expedient in me.
    </span></quote>
   </block>

   <block>
    <verse>34</verse><span>And he hath said:</span><quote><span>
     Repent all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me, and be baptized in my
     name, and have faith in me, that ye may be saved.
    </span></quote>
   </block>

   <block>
    <verse>35</verse><span>And now, my beloved brethren, if this be the case that these things are
    true which I have spoken unto you, and God will show unto you, with
    power and great glory at the last day, that they are true. And if they
    are true:
    </span><dot><span>Has the day of miracles ceased?
     </span><verse>36</verse><span>Or</span></dot>
    <dot><span>Have angels ceased to appear unto the children of men? Or</span></dot>
    <dot><span>Has he withheld the power of the Holy Ghost from them? Or</span></dot>
    <dot><span>Will he, so long as time shall last, or the earth shall stand, or
    there shall be one man upon the face thereof to be saved?</span></dot>
   </block>

   <block>
    <verse>37</verse><span>Behold I say unto you nay, for it is by faith that miracles are
    wrought, and it is by faith that angels appear and minister unto
    men.</span></block>

   <block><span>
    Wherefore, if these things have ceased wo be unto the children of men, for
    it is because of unbelief, and all is vain.
    </span><verse>38</verse><span>For
    no man can be saved, according to the words of Christ, save they shall
    have faith in his name; wherefore, if these things have ceased, then has
    faith ceased also; and awful is the state of man, for they are as though
    there had been no redemption made.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>39</verse><span>But behold, my beloved brethren, I judge better things of you, for I
    judge that ye have faith in Christ because of your meekness; for if ye
    have not faith in him then ye are not fit to be numbered among the
    people of his church.</span></block>

  Hope
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <quote>
   <block>
    <verse>40</verse><span>And again, my beloved brethren, I would speak unto you concerning hope.
    How is it that you can attain unto faith, save ye shall have hope?
    </span><verse>41</verse><span>And what is it that ye shall hope for? Behold I say unto you that ye
    shall have hope through the atonement of Christ and the power of his
    resurrection to be raised unto life eternal, and this because of your
    faith in him according to the promise.
    </span><verse>42</verse><span>Wherefore, if a man have faith he must needs have hope; for without
    faith there cannot be any hope.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>43</verse><span>And again, behold I say unto you that he cannot have faith and hope,
    save he shall be meek, and lowly of heart.

  Charity
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <quote>
   <block><span>
    And if a man be meek and lowly in heart, and confesses by the power of the
    Holy Ghost that Jesus is the Christ, he must needs have charity; for if he
    have not charity he is nothing; wherefore he must needs have charity.
    </span><verse>45</verse><span>And charity suffereth long, and is kind, and
    envieth not, and is not puffed up, seeketh not her own, is not easily
    provoked, thinketh no evil, and rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in
    the truth, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things,
    endureth all things.
    </span><verse>46</verse><span>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, if ye have not charity, ye are nothing,
    for charity never faileth. Wherefore, cleave unto charity, which is the
    greatest of all, for all things must fail—</span><verse>47</verse><span>but charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and
    whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with
    him.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>48</verse><span>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with all the
    energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath
    bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ; that
    ye may become the sons of God; that when he shall appear we shall be
    like him, for we shall see him as he is; that we may have this hope;
    that we may be purified even as he is pure. Amen.

  BAPTIZING LITTLE CHILDREN AND THOSE WITHOUT THE LAW
 </span></blockheading>
 <chapter>8
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>An epistle of my father Mormon, written to me, Moroni; and it was

  did he write unto me, saying:
  </span><quote>
   <verse>2</verse><span>My beloved son, Moroni, I rejoice exceedingly that your Lord Jesus
   Christ hath been mindful of you, and hath called you to his ministry,
   and to his holy work.
   </span><verse>3</verse><span>I am

 <block>
  <quote>
   <block>
    <verse>4</verse><span>And now, my son, I speak unto you concerning that which grieveth me
    exceedingly; for it grieveth me that there should disputations rise
    among you.
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>For, if I have learned the truth, there have been disputations among
    you concerning the baptism of your little children.
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>And now, my son, I desire that ye should labor diligently, that this
    gross error should be removed from among you; for, for this intent I
    have written this epistle.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>7</verse><span>For immediately after I had learned these things of you I inquired of
    the Lord concerning the matter. And the word of the Lord came to me by
    the power of the Holy Ghost, saying:</span><quote>
     <verse>8</verse><span>Listen to the words of Christ, your Redeemer, your Lord and your God.
     Behold, I came into the world not to call the righteous but sinners to
     repentance; the whole need no physician, but they that are sick;
     wherefore, little children are whole, for they are not capable of
     committing sin; wherefore the curse of Adam is taken from them in me,
     that it hath no power over them; and the law of circumcision is done
     away in me.</span></quote>
   </block>

   <block>
    <verse>9</verse><span>And after this manner did the Holy Ghost manifest the word of God unto
    me. Wherefore, my beloved son, I know that it is solemn mockery before
    God that ye should baptize little children.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>10</verse><span>Behold I say unto you that this thing shall ye teach—repentance and
    baptism unto those who are accountable and capable of committing sin.
    Yea, teach parents that they must repent and be baptized, and humble
    themselves as their little children, and they shall all be saved with
    their little children.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>11</verse><span>And their little children need no repentance, neither baptism. Behold,
    baptism is unto repentance to the fulfilling the commandments unto the
    remission of sins.
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>But little children are alive in Christ, even from the foundation of
    the world. If not so, God is a partial god, and also a changeable god,
    and a respecter to persons; for how many little children have died
    without baptism!
    </span><verse>13</verse><span>Wherefore, if little children could not be saved without baptism, these
    must have gone to an endless hell.
    </span><verse>14</verse><span>Behold I say unto you, that he that supposeth that little children need
    baptism is in the gall of bitterness and in the bonds of iniquity; for
    he hath neither faith, hope, nor charity; wherefore, should he be cut
    off while in the thought, he must go down to hell.
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>For awful is the wickedness to suppose that God saveth one child
    because of baptism, and the other must perish because he hath no
    baptism.
    </span><verse>16</verse><span>Wo be unto them that shall pervert the ways of the Lord after this
    manner, for they shall perish except they repent.</span></block>

   <block><span>Behold, I speak with boldness, having authority from God; and I fear not
   what man can do; for perfect love casteth out all fear.
    </span><verse>17</verse><span>And I am filled with charity, which is
    everlasting love; wherefore, all children are alike unto me; wherefore, I
    love little children with a perfect love; and they are all alike and
    partakers of salvation.
    </span><verse>18</verse><span>For I know that God is
    not a partial god, neither a changeable being; but he is unchangeable from
    all eternity to all eternity.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>19</verse><span>Little children cannot repent; wherefore, it is awful wickedness to
    deny the pure mercies of God unto them, for they are all alive in him
    because of his mercy.
    </span><verse>20</verse><span>And he
    that saith that little children need baptism denieth the mercies of

    redemption.
    </span><verse>21</verse><span>Wo unto such, for they are in danger of death,
    hell, and an endless torment. I speak it boldly; God hath commanded me.
    Listen unto them and give heed, or they stand against you at the
    judgment-seat of Christ.

   <block><span>And also all they that are without the law. For the power of redemption
   cometh on all them that have no law; wherefore, he that is not condemned,
   or he that is under no condemnation, cannot repent; and unto such baptism
   availeth nothing.
    </span><verse>23</verse><span>But it is mockery before God,
    denying the mercies of Christ, and the power of his Holy Spirit, and
    putting trust in dead works.
    </span><verse>24</verse><span>Behold, my son,
    this thing ought not to be; for repentance is unto them that are under
    condemnation and under the curse of a broken law.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>25</verse><span>And the first fruits of repentance is baptism; and baptism cometh by
    faith unto the fulfilling the commandments; and the fulfilling the
    commandments bringeth remission of sins;
    </span><verse>26</verse><span>and the remission of sins bringeth meekness, and lowliness of heart;
    and because of meekness and lowliness of heart cometh the visitation of
    the Holy Ghost, which Comforter filleth with hope and perfect love,
    which love endureth by diligence unto prayer, until the end shall come,
    when all the saints shall dwell with God.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>27</verse><span>Behold, my son, I will write unto you again if I go not out soon
    against the Lamanites. Behold, the pride of this nation, or the people
    of the Nephites, hath proven their destruction except they should
    repent.
    </span><verse>28</verse><span>Pray for them, my son, that repentance may come unto them. But behold,
    I fear lest the Spirit hath ceased striving with them; and in this part
    of the land they are also seeking to put down all power and authority
    which cometh from God; and they are denying the Holy Ghost.
    </span><verse>29</verse><span>And after rejecting so great a knowledge, my son, they must perish
    soon, unto the fulfilling of the prophecies which were spoken by the
    prophets, as well as the words of our Savior himself.</span></block>

    <verse>1</verse><span>My beloved son, I write unto you again that ye may know that I am yet
    alive; but I write somewhat of that which is grievous.
    </span><verse>2</verse><span>For behold, I have had a sore battle with the Lamanites, in which we
    did not conquer; and Archeantus has fallen by the sword, and also Luram
    and Emron; yea, and we have lost a great number of our choice men.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>3</verse><span>And now behold, my son, I fear lest the Lamanites shall destroy this
    people; for they do not repent, and Satan stirreth them up continually
    to anger one with another.
    </span><verse>4</verse><span>Behold, I am laboring with them continually; and when I speak the word
    of God with sharpness they tremble and anger against me; and when I use
    no sharpness they harden their hearts against it; wherefore, I fear lest
    the Spirit of the Lord hath ceased striving with them.
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>For so exceedingly do they anger that it seemeth me that they have no
    fear of death; and they have lost their love, one towards another; and
    they thirst after blood and revenge continually.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>6</verse><span>And now, my beloved son, notwithstanding their hardness, let us labor
    diligently; for if we should cease to labor, we should be brought under
    condemnation; for we have a labor to perform whilst in this tabernacle
    of clay, that we may conquer the enemy of all righteousness, and rest
    our souls in the kingdom of God.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>7</verse><span>And now I write somewhat concerning the sufferings of this people. For
    according to the knowledge which I have received from Amoron, behold,
    the Lamanites have many prisoners, which they took from the tower of
    Sherrizah; and there were men, women, and children.
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>And the husbands and fathers of those women and children they have
    slain; and they feed the women upon the flesh of their husbands, and the
    children upon the flesh of their fathers; and no water, save a little,
    do they give unto them.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>9</verse><span>And notwithstanding this great abomination of the Lamanites, it doth
    not exceed that of our people in Moriantum. For behold, many of the
    daughters of the Lamanites have they taken prisoners; and after
    depriving them of that which was most dear and precious above all
    things, which is chastity and virtue—</span><verse>10</verse><span>and after they had done this thing, they did murder them in a most
    cruel manner, torturing their bodies even unto death; and after they
    have done this, they devour their flesh like unto wild beasts, because
    of the hardness of their hearts; and they do it for a token of
    bravery.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>11</verse><span>O my beloved son, how can a people like this, that are without
    civilization
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>(and
    only a few years have passed away, and they were a civil and a delightsome
    people).
    </span><verse>13</verse><span>But O my son, how can a people like
    this, whose delight is in so much abomination—</span><verse>14</verse><span>how can we expect that God will stay his hand in judgment against us?
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>Behold, my heart cries:
    </span><quote><span>
     Wo unto this people. Come out in judgment, O God, and hide their sins, and
     wickedness, and abominations from before thy face!
    </span></quote>
   </block>

   <block>
    <verse>16</verse><span>And again, my son, there are many widows and their daughters who remain
    in Sherrizah; and that part of the provisions which the Lamanites did
    not carry away, behold, the army of Zenephi has carried away, and left
    them to wander whithersoever they can for food; and many old women do
    faint by the way and die.
    </span><verse>17</verse><span>And the army which is with me is weak; and the armies of the Lamanites
    are betwixt Sherrizah and me; and as many as have fled to the army of
    Aaron have fallen victims to their awful brutality.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>18</verse><span>O the depravity of my people! They are without order and without mercy.
    Behold, I am but a man, and I have but the strength of a man, and I
    cannot any longer enforce my commands.
    </span><verse>19</verse><span>And they have become strong in their perversion; and they are alike
    brutal, sparing none, neither old nor young; and they delight in
    everything save that which is good; and the suffering of our women and
    our children upon all the face of this land doth exceed everything; yea,
    tongue cannot tell, neither can it be written.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>20</verse><span>And now, my son, I dwell no longer upon this horrible scene. Behold,
    thou knowest the wickedness of this people; thou knowest that they are
    without principle, and past feeling; and their wickedness doth exceed
    that of the Lamanites.

    must perish except they repent and return unto him.
    </span><verse>23</verse><span>And if they perish it will be like unto the
    Jaredites, because of the wilfullness of their hearts, seeking for blood

  MORONI’S EXHORTATION
 </span></subsectionheading>
 <blockheading><span>
  TO THE LAMANITES
 </span></blockheading>
 <chapter>10
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Now I, Moroni, write somewhat as seemeth me good; and I write unto my
  brethren, the Lamanites; and I would that they should know that more
  than four hundred and twenty years have passed away since the sign was
  given of the coming of Christ.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And I seal up these records, after I have spoken a few words by way of
  exhortation unto you.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things, if it
  be wisdom in God that ye should read them, that ye would remember how
  merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the creation
  of Adam even down until the time that ye shall receive these things, and
  ponder it in your hearts.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye
  would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these
  things are not true.
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  And if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith
  in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the
  Holy Ghost.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And by the power of the Holy Ghost
  ye may know the truth of all things.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And
  whatsoever thing is good is just and true; wherefore, nothing that is good
  denieth the Christ, but acknowledgeth that he is.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And ye may know that he is, by the power of the
  Holy Ghost.
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  Wherefore I would exhort you that ye deny not the power of God; for he
  worketh by power, according to the faith of the children of men, the same
  today and tomorrow and forever.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  The gifts of God
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>And again, I exhort you, my brethren, that ye deny not the gifts of
  God, for they are many; and they come from the same God. And there are
  different ways that these gifts are administered; but it is the same God
  who worketh all in all; and they are given by the manifestations of the
  Spirit of God unto men, to profit them.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>For behold,
  </span><dot><span>to one is given by the Spirit of God, that he may teach the word of wisdom;
   </span><verse>10</verse><span>and</span></dot>
  <dot><span>to another, that he may teach the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;
   </span><verse>11</verse><span>and</span></dot>
  <dot><span>to another, exceedingly great faith; and</span></dot>
  <dot><span>to another, the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;
   </span><verse>12</verse><span>and again,</span></dot>
  <dot><span>to another, that he may work mighty miracles;
   </span><verse>13</verse><span>and again,</span></dot>
  <dot><span>to another, that he may prophesy concerning all things;
   </span><verse>14</verse><span>and again,</span></dot>
  <dot><span>to another, the beholding of angels and ministering spirits;
   </span><verse>15</verse><span>and again,</span></dot>
  <dot><span>to another, all kinds of tongues;
   </span><verse>16</verse><span>and again,</span></dot>
  <dot><span>to another, the interpretation of languages and of divers kinds of tongues.</span></dot>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>And all these gifts come by the Spirit of Christ; and they come unto
  every man severally, according as he will.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>And I would exhort you, my beloved brethren, that ye remember that
  every good gift cometh of Christ.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And I would exhort you, my beloved brethren, that ye remember that he
  is the same yesterday, today, and forever, and that all these gifts of
  which I have spoken, which are spiritual, never will be done away, even
  as long as the world shall stand, only according to the unbelief of the
  children of men.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>Wherefore, there must be faith; and if there must be faith there must
  also be hope; and if there must be hope there must also be charity.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>And except ye have charity ye can in nowise be saved in the kingdom of
  God; neither can ye be saved in the kingdom of God if ye have not faith;
  neither can ye if ye have no hope.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>And if ye have no hope ye must needs be in despair; and despair cometh
  because of iniquity.
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>And Christ truly said unto our fathers:</span><quote><span>
   If ye have faith ye can do all things which are expedient unto me.
  </span></quote>

 <blockheading><span>
  TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH
 </span></blockheading>
 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>And now I speak unto all the ends of the earth—that if the day cometh
  that the power and gifts of God shall be done away among you, it shall
  be because of unbelief.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>And wo be unto the children of men if this be the case; for there shall
  be none that doeth good among you, no not one. For if there be one among
  you that doeth good, he shall work by the power and gifts of God.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>And wo unto them who shall do these things away and die, for they die
  in their sins, and they cannot be saved in the kingdom of God; and I
  speak it according to the words of Christ; and I lie not.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>27</verse><span>And I exhort you to remember these things; for the time speedily cometh
  that ye shall know that I lie not, for ye shall see me at the bar of
  God; and the Lord God will say unto you:</span><quote><span>
   Did I not declare my words unto you, which were written by this man, like
   as one crying from the dead, yea, even as one speaking out of the dust?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>28</verse><span>I declare these things unto the fulfilling of the prophecies. And
  behold, they shall proceed forth out of the mouth of the everlasting
  God; and his word shall hiss forth from generation to generation.
  </span><verse>29</verse><span>And God shall show unto you, that that which I have written is
  true.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>30</verse><span>And again I would exhort you that ye would come unto Christ, and lay
  hold upon every good gift, and touch not the evil gift, nor the unclean
  thing.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>31</verse><span>And awake, and arise from the dust, O Jerusalem;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>yea, and put on thy beautiful garments, O daughter of Zion;</span></indent><span>
  and strengthen thy stakes and enlarge thy borders forever,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>that thou mayest no more be confounded,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>that the covenants of the Eternal Father which he hath made unto thee, O house of</span></indent>
  <indent><span>Israel, may be fulfilled.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>32</verse><span>Yea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of
  all ungodliness. And if ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and
  love God with all your might, mind and strength, then is his grace
  sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be perfect in
  Christ; and if by the grace of God ye are perfect in Christ, ye can in
  nowise deny the power of God.
  </span><verse>33</verse><span>And again, if ye
  by the grace of God are perfect in Christ, and deny not his power, then
  are ye sanctified in Christ by the grace of God, through the shedding of
  the blood of Christ, which is in the covenant of the Father unto the
  remission of your sins, that ye become holy, without spot.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>34</verse><span>And now I bid unto all, farewell. I soon go to rest in the paradise of
  God, until my spirit and body shall again reunite, and I am brought
  forth triumphant through the air, to meet you before the pleasing bar of
  the great Jehovah, the Eternal Judge of both quick and dead. Amen.
