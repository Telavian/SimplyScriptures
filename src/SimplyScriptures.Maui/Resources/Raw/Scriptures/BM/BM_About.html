                This edition increases the readability of
                The Book of Mormon
                by modernizing the page layout. The text is put into standard paragraphs and white space and other modern tools
                (section headers, bullet lists, etc.) are used to help with readability. While the verses and
                chapters of the 1981 edition have been maintained to help locate specific verses, those
                references are visually subdued so as to not distract from the message.

                Words that are part of the 1981 scriptural record appear in serif font in the main body. Anything not part of that record (verse numbers, chapter numbers, and section headers)
                appear in this sans-serif font. Anything in a sans-serif font is an addition of men and can be
                treated accordingly. It should also be noted that there was no punctuation in the manuscript
                that was delivered to the printer. The punctuation in
                The Book of Mormon
                was added by
                the original typesetter, not
                Joseph Smith. Accordingly, this edition occasionally makes
                changes to the punctuation.

                    information, it is designated by a box.

                This edition highlights some of the textual changes that have been made over time. Brigham
                Young University’s
                The Book of Mormon Critical Text Project
                was used as the basis for
                determining changes. Many of these changes were simple scribal errors between the original
                manuscript, printer’s manuscript, and printed versions. A few others were deliberate
                changes that Joseph Smith made after 1830. Where there have been changes, the words
                found in the 1981 edition are denoted by

                There are sections of Isaiah in the Book of Mormon that have differences between both the
                KJV and JST versions of Isaiah. These unique phrases are denoted by
