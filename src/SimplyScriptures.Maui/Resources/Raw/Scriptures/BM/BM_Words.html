    Mormon adds the plates of Nephi for a wise purpose
   </span></heading>

   <chapter>1</chapter>
    <verse>1</verse><span>And now I, Mormon, being about to deliver up the record which I
    have been making into the hands of my son Moroni, behold I have
    witnessed almost all the destruction of my people, the Nephites.
    </span><verse>2</verse><span>And it is many hundred years after the coming of Christ that I
    deliver these records into the hands of my son; and it supposeth me
    that he will witness the entire destruction of my people. But may
    God grant that he may survive them, that he may write somewhat
    concerning them, and somewhat concerning Christ, that perhaps some
    day it may profit them.

    <verse>3</verse><span>And now, I speak somewhat concerning that which I have written; for
    after I had made an abridgment from the plates of Nephi, down to the
    reign of this king Benjamin, of whom Amaleki spake, I searched among
    the records which had been delivered into my hands, and I found
    these plates, which contained this small account of the prophets,
    from Jacob down to the reign of this king Benjamin, and also many of
    the words of Nephi.
    </span><verse>4</verse><span>And the things which are upon these plates pleasing me, because of
    the prophecies of the coming of Christ; and my fathers knowing that
    many of them have been fulfilled; yea, and I also know that as many
    things as have been prophesied concerning us down to this day have
    been fulfilled, and as many as go beyond this day must surely come
    to pass—
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>wherefore, I chose these things, to finish my record upon them,
    which remainder of my record I shall take from the plates of Nephi;
    and I cannot write the hundredth part of the things of my people.
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>But behold, I shall take these plates, which contain these
    prophesyings and revelations, and put them with the remainder of my
    record, for they are choice unto me; and I know they will be choice
    unto my brethren.

   <block>
    <verse>7</verse><span>And I do this for a wise purpose; for thus it whispereth me,
    according to the workings of the Spirit of the Lord which is in me.
    And now, I do not know all things; but the Lord knoweth all things
    which are to come; wherefore, he worketh in me to do according to
    his will.
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>And my prayer to God is concerning my brethren, that they may once
    again come to the knowledge of God, yea, the redemption of Christ;
    that they may once again be a delightsome people.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>9</verse><span>And now I, Mormon, proceed to finish out my record, which I take
    from the plates of Nephi; and I make it according to the knowledge
    and the understanding which God has given me.

  KING BENJAMIN
 </span></blockheading>
 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>Wherefore, it came to pass that after Amaleki had delivered up
  these plates into the hands of king Benjamin, he took them and put
  them with the other plates, which contained records which had been
  handed down by the kings, from generation to generation until the
  days of king Benjamin.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And they were handed down from king Benjamin, from generation to
  generation until they have fallen into my hands. And I, Mormon, pray
  to God that they may be preserved from this time henceforth. And I
  know that they will be preserved; for there are great things written
  upon them, out of which my people and their brethren shall be judged
  at the great and last day, according to the word of God which is
  written.

  <verse>12</verse><span>And now, concerning this king Benjamin—he had somewhat of
  contentions among his own people.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And it came to pass also that the armies of the Lamanites came down
  out of the land of Nephi, to battle against his people. But behold,
  king Benjamin gathered
  together his armies, and he did stand against them; and he did fight
  with the strength of his own arm, with the sword of Laban.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And in the strength of the Lord they did
  contend against their enemies, until they had slain many thousands of
  the Lamanites. And it came to pass that they did contend against the
  Lamanites until they had driven them out of all the lands of their
  inheritance.

  <verse>15</verse><span>And it came to pass that after there had been false Christs, and
  their mouths had been shut, and they punished according to their
  crimes;
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>and after there had been false prophets, and false preachers and
  teachers among the people, and all these having been punished
  according to their crimes; and after there having been much
  contention and many dissensions away unto the Lamanites, behold, it
  came to pass that king Benjamin, with the assistance of the holy
  prophets who were among his people—</span><verse>17</verse><span>for behold, king Benjamin was a holy man, and he did reign over his
  people in righteousness; and there were many holy men in the land,
  and they did speak the word of God with power and with authority;
  and they did use much sharpness because of the stiffneckedness of
  the people—</span><verse>18</verse><span>wherefore, with the help of these, king Benjamin, by laboring with
  all the might of his body and the faculty of his whole soul, and
  also the prophets, did once more establish peace in the land.
