<book><span>THE BOOK OF MORMON</span></book>
 <chapter>1</chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And now I, Mormon, make a record of the things which I have both seen
  and heard, and call it the Book of Mormon.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>And about the time that Ammaron hid up the records unto the Lord, he
  came unto me, (I being about ten years of age, and I began to be learned
  somewhat after the manner of the learning of my people) and Ammaron said
  unto me:</span><quote><span>
   I perceive that thou art a sober child, and art quick to observe;
   </span><verse>3</verse><span>therefore, when ye are about twenty and four
   years old I would that ye should remember the things that ye have observed
   concerning this people; and when ye are of that age go to the land Antum,
   unto a hill which shall be called Shim; and there have I deposited unto
   the Lord all the sacred engravings concerning this people.
   </span><verse>4</verse><span>And behold, ye shall take the plates of Nephi
   unto yourself, and the remainder shall ye leave in the place where they
   are; and ye shall engrave on the plates of Nephi all the things that ye
   have observed concerning this people.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>And I, Mormon, being a descendant of Nephi, (and my father’s name was
  Mormon) I remembered the things which Ammaron commanded me.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And it came to pass that I, being eleven years old, was carried by my
  father into the land southward, even to the land of Zarahemla.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>The whole face of the land had become covered with buildings, and the
  people were as numerous almost as it were the sand of the sea.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>And it came to pass in this year there began to be a war between the
  Nephites, who consisted of the Nephites and the Jacobites and the
  Josephites and the Zoramites; and this war was between the Nephites, and
  the Lamanites and the Lemuelites and the Ishmaelites.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>Now the Lamanites and the Lemuelites and the Ishmaelites were called
  Lamanites, and the two parties were Nephites and Lamanites.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>And it came to pass that the war began to be among them in the borders
  of Zarahemla, by the waters of Sidon.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And it came to pass that the Nephites had gathered together a great
  number of men, even to exceed the number of thirty thousand. And it came
  to pass that they did have in this same year a number of battles, in
  which the Nephites did beat the Lamanites and did slay many of them.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And it came to pass that the Lamanites withdrew their design, and there
  was peace settled in the land; and peace did remain for the space of
  about four years, that there was no bloodshed.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  Wickedness
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>But wickedness did prevail upon the face of the whole land, insomuch
  that the Lord did take away his beloved disciples, and the work of
  miracles and of healing did cease because of the iniquity of the people.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And there were no gifts from the Lord, and the Holy Ghost did not come
  upon any, because of their wickedness and unbelief.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And I, being fifteen years of age and being somewhat of a sober mind,
  therefore I was visited of the Lord, and tasted and knew of the goodness
  of Jesus.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And I did endeavor to preach unto this people, but my mouth was shut,
  and I was forbidden that I should preach unto them; for behold they had
  wilfully rebelled against their God; and the beloved disciples were
  taken away out of the land, because of their iniquity.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>But I did remain among them, but I was forbidden to preach unto them,
  because of the hardness of their hearts.
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  And because of the hardness of their hearts the land was cursed for their
  sake.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>And these Gadianton robbers, who were
  among the Lamanites, did infest the land, insomuch that the
  inhabitants thereof began to hide up their treasures in the earth; and
  they became slippery, because the Lord had cursed the land, that they
  could not hold them, nor retain them again.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And it came to pass that there were sorceries,
  and witchcrafts, and magics; and the power of the evil one was wrought
  upon all the face of the land, even unto the fulfilling of all the words
  of Abinadi, and also Samuel the Lamanite.
 </span></block>

 <subsectionheading><span>
  WAR BETWEEN NEPHITES AND LAMANITES
 </span></subsectionheading>
 <chapter>2
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And it came to pass in that same year there began to be a war again
  between the Nephites and the Lamanites. And notwithstanding I being
  young, was large in stature; therefore the people of Nephi appointed me
  that I should be their leader, or the leader of their armies.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>Therefore it came to pass that in my sixteenth year I did go forth at
  the head of an army of the Nephites, against the Lamanites; therefore
  three hundred and twenty and six years had passed away.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  Driven out
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>And it came to pass that in the three hundred and twenty and seventh
  year the Lamanites did come upon us with exceedingly great power,
  insomuch that they did frighten my armies; therefore they would not
  fight, and they began to retreat towards the north countries.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And it came to pass that we did come to the city of Angola, and we did
  take possession of the city, and make preparations to defend ourselves
  against the Lamanites.
  And it came to pass that we did fortify the city with our might; but
  notwithstanding all our fortifications the Lamanites did come upon us and
  did drive us out of the city.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And they did also
  drive us forth out of the land of David.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  Destruction and sorrow in Joshua
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And we marched forth and came to the land of Joshua, which was in the
  borders west by the seashore.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And it came to pass that we did gather in our people as fast as it were
  possible, that we might get them together in one body.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>But behold, the land was filled with robbers and with Lamanites; and
  notwithstanding the great destruction which hung over my people, they
  did not repent of their evil doings; therefore there was blood and
  carnage spread throughout all the face of the land, both on the part of
  the Nephites and also on the part of the Lamanites; and it was one
  complete revolution throughout all the face of the land.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>And now, the Lamanites had a king, and his name was Aaron; and he came
  against us with an army of forty and four thousand. And behold, I
  withstood him with forty and two thousand. And it came to pass that I
  beat him with my army that he fled before me. And behold, all this was
  done, and three hundred and thirty years had passed away.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>And it came to pass that the Nephites began to repent of their
  iniquity, and began to cry even as had been prophesied by Samuel the
  prophet; for behold no man could keep that which was his own, for the
  thieves, and the robbers, and the murderers, and the magic art, and the
  witchcraft which was in the land.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>Thus there began to be a mourning and a lamentation in all the land
  because of these things, and more especially among the people of
  Nephi.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>And it came to pass that when I, Mormon, saw their lamentation and
  their mourning and their sorrow before the Lord, my heart did begin to
  rejoice within me, knowing the mercies and the long-suffering of the
  Lord, therefore supposing that he would be merciful unto them that they
  would again become a righteous people.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>But behold this my joy was
  vain, for their sorrowing was not unto repentance, because of the goodness
  of God; but it was rather the sorrowing of the damned, because the Lord
  would not always suffer them to take happiness in sin.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And they did not come unto Jesus with broken
  hearts and contrite spirits, but they did curse God, and wish to die.
  Nevertheless they would struggle with the sword for their lives.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>And it came to pass that my sorrow did return
  unto me again, and I saw that the day of grace was passed with them, both
  temporally and spiritually; for I saw thousands of them hewn down in open
  rebellion against their God, and heaped up as dung upon the face of the
  land. And thus three hundred and forty and four years had passed away.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  Mormon retrieves the records
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>And it came to pass that in the three hundred and forty and fifth year
  the Nephites did begin to flee before the Lamanites; and they were
  pursued until they came even to the land of Jashon, before it was
  possible to stop them in their retreat.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>And now, the city of Jashon was near the land where Ammaron had
  deposited the records unto the Lord, that they might not be destroyed.
  And behold I had gone according to the word of Ammaron, and taken the
  plates of Nephi, and did make a record according to the words of
  Ammaron.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>And upon the plates of Nephi I did make a full account of all the
  wickedness and abominations; but upon these plates I did forbear to make
  a full account of their wickedness and abominations, for behold, a
  continual scene of wickedness and abominations has been before mine eyes
  ever since I have been sufficient to behold the ways of man.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And wo is me because of their wickedness; for my heart has been filled
  with sorrow because of their wickedness, all my days; nevertheless, I
  know that I shall be lifted up at the last day.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  Victory in Shem
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>And it came to pass that in this year the people of Nephi again were
  hunted and driven. And it came to pass that we were driven forth until
  we had come northward to the land which was called Shem.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>And it came to pass that we did fortify the city of Shem, and we did
  gather in our people as much as it were possible, that perhaps we might
  save them from destruction.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>And it came to pass in the three hundred and forty and sixth year they
  began to come upon us again.
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>And it came to pass that I did speak unto my people, and did urge them
  with great energy, that they would stand boldly before the Lamanites and
  fight for their wives, and their children, and their houses, and their
  homes.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>And my words did arouse them somewhat to vigor, insomuch that they did
  not flee from before the Lamanites, but did stand with boldness against
  them.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>And it came to pass that we did contend with an army of thirty thousand
  against an army of fifty thousand. And it came to pass that we did stand
  before them with such firmness that they did flee from before us.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>And it came to pass that when they had fled we did pursue them with our
  armies, and did meet them again, and did beat them.
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  Nevertheless the strength of the Lord was not with us; yea, we were left
  to ourselves, that the Spirit of the Lord did not abide in us; therefore
  we had become weak like unto our brethren.
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>And
  my heart did sorrow because of this the great calamity of my people,
  because of their wickedness and their abominations. But behold, we did go
  forth against the Lamanites and the robbers of Gadianton, until we had
  again taken possession of the lands of our inheritance.
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>And the three hundred and forty and ninth year
  had passed away.
 </span></block>

 <block><span>And in the three hundred and fiftieth year we made a treaty with the
 Lamanites and the robbers of Gadianton, in which we did get the lands of
 our inheritance divided.
  </span><verse>29</verse><span>And the Lamanites did give unto us the land
  northward, yea, even to the narrow passage which led into the land
  southward. And we did give unto the Lamanites all the land southward.
 </span></block>

 <chapter>3
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And it came to pass that the Lamanites did not come to battle again
  until ten years more had passed away. And behold, I had employed my
  people, the Nephites, in preparing their lands and their arms against
  the time of battle.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  Mormon refuses to lead
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>And it came to pass that the Lord did say unto me:</span><quote><span>
   Cry unto this people: Repent ye, and come unto me, and be ye baptized, and
   build up again my church, and ye shall be spared.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>And I did cry unto this people, but it was in vain; and they did not
  realize that it was the Lord that had spared them, and granted unto them
  a chance for repentance. And behold they did harden their hearts against
  the Lord their God.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>And it came to pass that after this tenth year had passed away, making,
  in the whole, three hundred and sixty years from the coming of Christ,
  the king of the Lamanites sent an epistle unto me, which gave unto me to
  know that they were preparing to come again to battle against us.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And it came to pass that I did cause my people that they should gather
  themselves together at the land Desolation, to a city which was in the
  borders, by the narrow pass which led into the land southward.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And there we did place our armies, that we might stop the armies of the
  Lamanites, that they might not get possession of any of our lands;
  therefore we did fortify against them with all our force.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>And it came to pass that in the three hundred and sixty and first year
  the Lamanites did come down to the city of Desolation to battle against
  us; and it came to pass that in that year we did beat them, insomuch
  that they did return to their own lands again.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>And in the three hundred and sixty and second year they did come down
  again to battle. And we did beat them again, and did slay a great number
  of them, and their dead were cast into the sea.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>And now, because of this great thing which my people, the Nephites, had
  done, they began to boast in their own strength, and began to swear
  before the heavens that they would avenge themselves of the blood of
  their brethren who had been slain by their enemies.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And they did swear by the heavens, and also by the throne of God, that
  they would go up to battle against their enemies, and would cut them off
  from the face of the land.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>And it came to pass that I, Mormon, did utterly refuse from this time
  forth to be a commander and a leader of this people, because of their
  wickedness and abomination.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>Behold, I had led them, notwithstanding their wickedness I had led them
  many times to battle, and had loved them, according to the love of God
  which was in me, with all my heart; and my soul had been poured out in
  prayer unto my God all the day long for them; nevertheless, it was
  without faith, because of the hardness of their hearts.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>And thrice have I delivered them out of the hands of their enemies, and
  they have repented not of their sins.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And when they had sworn by all that had been forbidden them by our Lord
  and Savior Jesus Christ, that they would go up unto their enemies to
  battle, and avenge themselves of the blood of their brethren, behold the
  voice of the Lord came unto me, saying:</span><quote>
   <verse>15</verse><span>Vengeance is mine, and I will repay; and because this people repented
   not after I had delivered them, behold, they shall be cut off from the
   face of the earth.</span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>And it came to pass that I utterly refused to go up against mine
  enemies; and I did even as the Lord had commanded me; and I did stand as
  an idle witness to manifest unto the world the things which I saw and
  heard, according to the manifestations of the Spirit which had testified
  of things to come.

    <verse>17</verse><span>Therefore I write unto you, Gentiles, and also unto you, house of

  Fleeing and regaining Desolation
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>4
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And now it came to pass that in the three hundred and sixty and third
  year the Nephites did go up with their armies to battle against the
  Lamanites, out of the land Desolation.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And it came to pass that the armies of the Nephites were driven back
  again to the land of Desolation. And while they were yet weary, a fresh
  army of the Lamanites did come upon them; and they had a sore battle,
  insomuch that the Lamanites did take possession of the city Desolation,
  and did slay many of the Nephites, and did take many prisoners.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And the remainder did flee and join the inhabitants of the city
  Teancum. Now the city Teancum lay in the borders by the seashore; and it
  was also near the city Desolation.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>And it was because the armies of the Nephites went up unto the
  Lamanites that they began to be smitten; for were it not for that, the
  Lamanites could have had no power over them.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>But, behold, the judgments of God will overtake the wicked; and it is
  by the wicked that the wicked are punished; for it is the wicked that
  stir up the hearts of the children of men unto bloodshed.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And it came to pass that the Lamanites did make preparations to come
  against the city Teancum.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And it came to pass in the three hundred and sixty and fourth year the
  Lamanites did come against the city Teancum, that they might take
  possession of the city Teancum also.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>And it came to pass that they were repulsed and driven back by the
  Nephites.
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  And when the Nephites saw that they had driven the Lamanites they did
  again boast of their own strength; and they went forth in their own might,
  and took possession again of the city Desolation.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>And now all these things had been done, and
  there had been thousands slain on both sides, both the Nephites and the
  Lamanites.

  Fleeing and regaining Desolation and Teancum
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>And it came to pass that the three hundred and sixty and sixth year had
  passed away, and the Lamanites came again upon the Nephites to battle;
  and yet the Nephites repented not of the evil they had done, but
  persisted in their wickedness continually.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>And it is impossible for the tongue to describe, or for man to write a
  perfect description of the horrible scene of the blood and carnage which
  was among the people, both of the Nephites and of the Lamanites; and
  every heart was hardened, so that they delighted in the shedding of
  blood continually.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And there never had been so great wickedness among all the children of
  Lehi, nor even among all the house of Israel, according to the words of
  the Lord, as was among this people.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>And it came to pass that the Lamanites did take possession of the city
  Desolation, and this because their number did exceed the number of the
  Nephites.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And they did also march forward against the city Teancum, and did drive
  the inhabitants forth out of her, and did take many prisoners both women
  and children, and did offer them up as sacrifices unto their idol
  gods.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And it came to pass that in the three hundred and sixty and seventh
  year, the Nephites being angry because the Lamanites had sacrificed
  their women and their children, that they did go against the Lamanites
  with exceedingly great anger, insomuch that they did beat again the
  Lamanites, and drive them out of their lands.

  number.

  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And it came to pass that the Lamanites did come down against the city
  Desolation; and there was an exceedingly sore battle fought in the land
  Desolation, in the which they did beat the Nephites.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>And they fled again from before them, and they came to the city Boaz;
  and there they did stand against the Lamanites with exceeding boldness,
  insomuch that the Lamanites did not beat them until they had come again
  the second time.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>And when they had come the second time, the Nephites were driven and
  slaughtered with an exceedingly great slaughter; their women and their
  children were again sacrificed unto idols.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>And it came to pass that the Nephites did again flee from before them,
  taking all the inhabitants with them, both in towns and villages.

  Mormon resumes command
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>And now I, Mormon, seeing that the Lamanites were about to overthrow
  the land, therefore I did go to the hill Shim, and did take up all the
  records which Ammaron had hid up unto the Lord.
  </span><chapter>5</chapter>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And it came to pass that I did go forth among the Nephites, and did
  repent of the oath which I had made that I would no more assist them;
  and they gave me command again of their armies, for they looked upon me
  as though I could deliver them from their afflictions.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>But behold, I was without hope, for I knew the judgments of
  the Lord which should come upon them; for they repented not of their
  iniquities, but did struggle for their lives without calling upon that
  Being who created them.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>And it came to pass that the Lamanites did come against us as we had
  fled to the city of Jordan; but behold, they were driven back that they
  did not take the city at that time.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And it came to pass that they came against us again, and we did
  maintain the city. And there were also other cities which were
  maintained by the Nephites, which strongholds did cut them off that they
  could not get into the country which lay before us, to destroy the
  inhabitants of our land.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And it came to pass that whatsoever lands we had passed by, and the
  inhabitants thereof were not gathered in, were destroyed by the
  Lamanites, and their towns, and villages, and cities were burned with
  fire; and thus three hundred and seventy and nine years passed
  away.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And it came to pass that in the three hundred and eightieth year the
  Lamanites did come again against us to battle, and we did stand against
  them boldly; but it was all in vain, for so great were their numbers
  that they did tread the people of the Nephites under their feet.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And it came to pass that we did again take to flight, and those whose
  flight was swifter than the Lamanites’ did escape, and those whose
  flight did not exceed the Lamanites’ were swept down and
  destroyed.

   </span></heading>

   <block>
    <verse>8</verse><span>And now behold, I, Mormon, do not desire to harrow up the souls of men
    in casting before them such an awful scene of blood and carnage as was
    laid before mine eyes; but I, knowing that these things must surely be
    made known, and that all things which are hid must be revealed upon the
    house-tops—</span><verse>9</verse><span>and also that a knowledge of these things must come unto the remnant of
    these people, and also unto the Gentiles, who the Lord hath said should
    scatter this people, and this people should be counted as naught among
    them— therefore I write a small abridgment, daring not to give a full
    account of the things which I have seen, because of the commandment
    which I have received, and also that ye might not have too great sorrow
    because of the wickedness of this people.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>10</verse><span>And now behold, this I speak unto their seed, and also to the Gentiles
    who have care for the house of Israel, that realize and know from whence
    their blessings come.
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>For I know that such will sorrow for the calamity of the house of
    Israel; yea, they will sorrow for the destruction of this people; they
    will sorrow that this people had not repented that they might have been
    clasped in the arms of Jesus.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>12</verse><span>Now these things are written unto the remnant of the house of Jacob;
    and they are written after this manner, because it is known of God that
    wickedness will not bring them forth unto them; and they are to be hid
    up unto the Lord that they may come forth in his own due time.
    </span><verse>13</verse><span>And this is the commandment which I have received; and behold, they
    shall come forth according to the commandment of the Lord, when he shall
    see fit, in his wisdom.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>14</verse><span>And behold, they shall go unto the unbelieving of the Jews; and for
    this intent shall they go—that they may be persuaded that Jesus is the
    Christ, the Son of the living God; that the Father may bring about,
    through his most Beloved, his great and eternal purpose, in restoring
    the Jews, or all the house of Israel, to the land of their inheritance,
    which the Lord their God hath given them, unto the fulfilling of his
    covenant.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>15</verse><span>And also that the seed of this people may more fully believe his
    gospel, which shall go forth unto them from the Gentiles; for this
    people shall be scattered, and shall become a dark, a filthy, and a
    loathsome people, beyond the description of that which ever hath been
    amongst us, yea, even that which hath been among the Lamanites, and this
    because of their unbelief and idolatry.
    </span><verse>16</verse><span>For behold, the
    Spirit of the Lord hath already ceased to strive with their fathers; and
    they are without Christ and God in the world; and they are driven about as
    chaff before the wind.
    </span><verse>17</verse><span>They were once a
    delightsome people, and they had Christ for their shepherd; yea, they were
    led even by God the Father.
    </span><verse>18</verse><span>But now, behold,
    they are led about by Satan, even as chaff is driven before the wind, or
    as a vessel is tossed about upon the waves, without sail or anchor, or
    without anything wherewith to steer her; and even as she is, so are they.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>19</verse><span>And behold, the Lord hath reserved their blessings, which they might
    have received in the land, for the Gentiles who shall possess the land.
    </span><verse>20</verse><span>But behold, it shall come to pass that they shall be driven and
    scattered by the Gentiles; and after they have been driven and scattered
    by the Gentiles, behold, then will the Lord remember the covenant which
    he made unto Abraham and unto all the house of Israel.
    </span><verse>21</verse><span>And also the Lord will remember the prayers of the righteous, which
    have been put up unto him for them.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>22</verse><span>And then, O ye Gentiles, how can ye stand before the power of God,
    except ye shall repent and turn from your evil ways?
    </span><verse>23</verse><span>Know ye not that ye are in the hands of God? Know ye not that he hath
    all power, and at his great command the earth shall be rolled together
    as a scroll?
    </span><verse>24</verse><span>Therefore, repent ye, and humble yourselves before him, lest he shall
    come out in justice against you—lest a remnant of the seed of Jacob
    shall go forth among you as a lion, and tear you in pieces, and there is
    none to deliver.

  Nephites.

  Destruction at Cumorah
 </span></heading>

 <block><span>
  And it came to pass that we did march forth before the Lamanites.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And I, Mormon, wrote an epistle unto the king of
  the Lamanites, and desired of him that he would grant unto us that we
  might gather together our people unto the land of Cumorah, by a hill which
  was called Cumorah, and there we could give them battle.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And it came to pass that the king of the
  Lamanites did grant unto me the thing which I desired.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And it came to pass that we did march forth to
  the land of Cumorah, and we did pitch our tents around about the hill
  Cumorah; and it was in a land of many waters, rivers, and fountains; and
  here we had hope to gain advantage over the Lamanites.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And when three hundred and eighty and four years
  had passed away, we had gathered in all the remainder of our people unto
  the land of Cumorah.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And it came to pass that when we had gathered in all our people in one
  to the land of Cumorah, behold I, Mormon, began to be old; and knowing
  it to be the last struggle of my people, and having been commanded of
  the Lord that I should not suffer the records which had been handed down
  by our fathers, which were sacred, to fall into the hands of the
  Lamanites, (for the Lamanites would destroy them) therefore I made this
  record out of the plates of Nephi, and hid up in the hill Cumorah all
  the records which had been entrusted to me by the hand of the Lord, save
  it were these few plates which I gave unto my son Moroni.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>And it came to pass that my people, with their wives and their
  children, did now behold the armies of the Lamanites marching towards
  them; and with that awful fear of death which fills the breasts of all
  the wicked, did they await to receive them.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>And it came to pass that they came to battle against us, and every soul
  was filled with terror because of the greatness of their numbers.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>And it came to pass that they did fall upon my people with the sword,
  and with the bow, and with the arrow, and with the ax, and with all
  manner of weapons of war.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And it came to pass that my men were hewn down, yea, even my ten
  thousand who were with me, and I fell wounded in the midst; and they
  passed by me that they did not put an end to my life.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>And when they had gone through and hewn down all my people save it were
  twenty and four of us, (among whom was my son Moroni) and we having
  survived the dead of our people, did behold on the morrow, when the
  Lamanites had returned unto their camps, from the top of the hill
  Cumorah, the ten thousand of my people who were hewn down, being led in
  the front by me.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>And we also beheld the ten thousand of my people</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>who were led by my son Moroni.</span></indent>
  <verse>13</verse><span>And behold, the ten thousand of Gidgiddonah had fallen,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and he also in the midst.</span></indent>
  <verse>14</verse><span>And Lamah had fallen with his ten thousand;</span><break></break><span>
  and Gilgal had fallen with his ten thousand;</span><break></break><span>
  and Limhah had fallen with his ten thousand;</span><break></break><span>
  and Jeneum had fallen with his ten thousand;</span><break></break><span>
  and Cumenihah,</span><break></break><span>
  and Moronihah,</span><break></break><span>
  and Antionum,</span><break></break><span>
  and Shiblom,</span><break></break><span>
  and Shem,</span><break></break><span>
  and Josh, had fallen with their ten thousand each.</span><break></break>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And it came to pass that there were ten more who did fall by the sword,
  </span><indent><span>with their ten thousand each.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block><span>Yea, even all my people, save it were those twenty and four who were
 with me, and also a few who had escaped into the south countries, and a
 few who had
  </span><under>
   <printer><span>dissented</span></printer><span>deserted</span></under><span>
  over unto the Lamanites, had fallen; and their flesh, and
  bones, and blood lay upon the face of the earth, being left by the hands
  of those who slew them to molder upon the land, and to crumble and to
  return to their mother earth.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>And my soul was rent with anguish, because of the slain of my people,
  and I cried:</span><quote>
   <block>
    <verse>17</verse><span>O ye fair ones, how could ye have departed from the ways of the Lord! O
    ye fair ones, how could ye have rejected that Jesus, who stood with open
    arms to receive you!
    </span><verse>18</verse><span>Behold, if ye had not done this, ye would not have fallen. But behold,
    ye are fallen, and I mourn your loss.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>19</verse><span>O ye fair sons and daughters, ye fathers and mothers, ye husbands and
    wives, ye fair ones, how is it that ye could have fallen!
    </span><verse>20</verse><span>But behold, ye are gone, and my sorrows cannot bring your return.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>21</verse><span>And the day soon cometh that your mortal must put on immortality, and
    these bodies which are now moldering in corruption must soon become
    incorruptible bodies; and then ye must stand before the judgment-seat of
    Christ, to be judged according to your works; and if it so be that ye
    are righteous, then are ye blessed with your fathers who have gone
    before you.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>22</verse><span>O that ye had repented before this great destruction had come upon you.
    But behold, ye are gone, and the Father, yea, the Eternal Father of
    heaven, knoweth your state; and he doeth with you according to his
    justice and mercy.</span></block>

  WORDS FOR THE REMNANT
 </span></blockheading>
 <chapter>7</chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And now, behold, I would speak somewhat unto the remnant of this people
  who are spared, if it so be that God may give unto them my words, that
  they may know of the things of their fathers; yea, I speak unto you, ye
  remnant of the house of Israel; and these are the words which I
  speak:
  </span><dot>
   <verse>2</verse><span>Know ye that ye are of the house of Israel.
  </span></dot>
  <dot>
   <verse>3</verse><span>Know ye that ye must come unto repentance, or ye cannot be saved.
  </span></dot>
  <dot>
   <verse>4</verse><span>Know ye that ye must lay down your weapons of war, and delight no
   more in the shedding of blood, and take them not again, save it be
   that God shall command you.
  </span></dot>
  <dot>
   <verse>5</verse><span>Know ye that ye must come to the knowledge of your fathers, and
   repent of all your sins and iniquities, and believe in Jesus
   Christ.
  </span></dot>
 </block>

 <block><span>That he is the Son of God, and that he was slain by the Jews, and
 by the power of the Father he hath risen again, whereby he hath
 gained the victory over the grave; and also in him is the sting of
 death swallowed up.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And he bringeth to pass the resurrection of
  the dead, whereby man must be raised to stand before his
  judgment-seat.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And he hath brought to pass
  the redemption of the world, whereby he that is found guiltless before
  him at the judgment day hath it given unto him to dwell in the
  presence of God in his kingdom, to sing ceaseless praises with the
  choirs above, unto the Father, and unto the Son, and unto the Holy
  Ghost, which are one God, in a state of happiness which hath no end.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>Therefore repent, and be baptized in the name of Jesus, and lay
  hold upon the gospel of Christ, which shall be set before you, not
  only in this record but also in the record which shall come unto the
  Gentiles from the Jews, which record shall come from the Gentiles
  unto you.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>For behold, this is written for the intent that ye may believe
  that; and if ye believe that ye will believe this also; and if ye
  believe this ye will know concerning your fathers, and also the
  marvelous works which were wrought by the power of God among them.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And ye will also know that ye are a remnant of the seed of Jacob;
  therefore ye are numbered among the people of the first
  covenant.
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  And if it so be that ye believe in Christ, and are baptized, first
  with water, then with fire and with the Holy Ghost, following the
  example of our Savior, according to that which he hath commanded us,
  it shall be well with you in the day of judgment. Amen.

  WRITINGS OF MORONI
 </span></subsectionheading>
 <chapter>8
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Behold I, Moroni, do finish the record of my father, Mormon.
  Behold, I have but few things to write, which things I have been
  commanded by my father.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>And now it came to pass that after the great and tremendous battle
  at Cumorah, behold, the Nephites who had escaped into the country
  southward were hunted by the Lamanites, until they were all
  destroyed.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And my father also was killed by them.
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  And I even remain alone to write the sad tale of the destruction of my
  people. But behold, they are gone, and I fulfil the commandment of my
  father. And whether they will slay me, I know not.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>Therefore I will write and hide up the
  records in the earth; and whither I go it mattereth not.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>Behold, my father hath made this record, and
  he hath written the intent thereof. And behold, I would write it also
  if I had room upon the plates, but I have not; and ore I have none,
  for I am alone. My father hath been slain in battle, and all my
  kinsfolk, and I have not friends nor whither to go; and how long the
  Lord will suffer that I may live I know not.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>Behold, four hundred years have passed away since the coming of our
  Lord and Savior.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And behold, the Lamanites have hunted my people, the Nephites, down
  from city to city and from place to place, even until they are no
  more; and great has been their fall; yea, great and marvelous is the
  destruction of my people, the Nephites.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>And behold, it is the hand of the Lord which hath done it.
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  And behold also, the Lamanites are at war one with another; and the
  whole face of this land is one continual round of murder and
  bloodshed; and no one knoweth the end of the war.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>And now, behold, I say no more concerning them, for there are none
  save it be the Lamanites and robbers that do exist upon the face of
  the land.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And there are none that do know the true God save it be the
  disciples of Jesus, who did tarry in the land until the
  wickedness of the people was so great that the Lord would not suffer
  them to remain with the people; and
  </span><under>
   <printer><span>whither</span></printer><span>whether</span></under><span>
  they be upon the
  face of the land no man knoweth.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>But
  behold, my father and I have seen them, and they have ministered unto
  us.

  Receiving this record
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>And whoso receiveth this record, and shall not condemn it because
  of the imperfections which are in it, the same shall know of greater
  things than these. Behold, I am Moroni; and were it possible, I
  would make all things known unto you.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>Behold, I make an end of speaking concerning this people. I am the
  son of Mormon, and my father was a descendant of Nephi.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And I am the same who hideth up this record unto the Lord.
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  The plates thereof are of no worth, because of the commandment of the
  Lord. For he truly saith that no one shall have them to get gain; but
  the record thereof is of great worth; and whoso shall bring it to
  light, him will the Lord bless.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>For none
  can have power to bring it to light save it be given him of God; for
  God wills that it shall be done with an eye single to his glory, or
  the welfare of the ancient and long dispersed covenant people of the
  Lord.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>And blessed be he that shall bring this thing to light; for it
  shall be brought out of darkness unto light, according to the word
  of God; yea, it shall be brought out of the earth, and it shall
  shine forth out of darkness, and come unto the knowledge of the
  people; and it shall be done by the power of God.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>And if there be faults they be the faults
  of a man. But behold, we know no fault; nevertheless God knoweth all
  things; therefore, he that condemneth, let him be aware lest he shall
  be in danger of hell fire.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>And he that
  saith, “Show unto me, or ye shall be smitten”—let him
  </span><under>
   <printer><span>be aware</span></printer><span>beware</span></under><span>
  lest he commandeth that which is forbidden of the Lord.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>For behold, the same that judgeth rashly shall be judged rashly
  again; for according to his works shall his wages be; therefore, he
  that smiteth shall be smitten again, of the Lord.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>Behold what the scripture says:</span><quote><span>
   Man shall not smite, neither shall he judge; for judgment is mine,
   saith the Lord, and vengeance is mine also, and I will repay.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>And he that shall breathe out wrath and strifes against the work of
  the Lord, and against the covenant people of the Lord who are the
  house of Israel, and shall say, “We will destroy the work of the
  Lord, and the Lord will not remember his covenant which he hath made
  unto the house of Israel,” the same is in danger to be hewn down and
  cast into the fire.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>For the eternal purposes of the Lord shall roll on, until all his
  promises shall be fulfilled.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>Search the prophecies of Isaiah. Behold, I cannot write them.
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  Yea, behold I say unto you, that those saints who have gone before me,
  who have possessed this land, shall cry, yea, even from the dust will
  they cry unto the Lord. And as the Lord liveth he will remember the
  covenant which he hath made with them.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>And
  he knoweth their prayers, that they were in behalf of their brethren.
  And he knoweth their faith, for in his name could they remove
  mountains; and in his name could they cause the earth to shake; and by
  the power of his word did they cause prisons to tumble to the earth;
  yea, even the fiery furnace could not harm them, neither wild beasts
  nor poisonous serpents, because of the power of his word.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>And behold, their prayers were also in
  behalf of him that the Lord should suffer to bring these things forth.

  THE LAST DAYS

  </span><dot><span>
   And it shall come in a day when it shall be said that miracles are

   And it shall come even as if one should speak from the dead.
  </span></dot>

  <dot>
   <verse>28</verse><span>Yea, it shall come in a day when the power of God shall be denied,
   and churches become defiled and be lifted up in the pride of their
   hearts; yea, even in a day when leaders of churches and teachers
   shall rise in the pride of their hearts, even to the envying of them
   who belong to their churches.
  </span></dot>
  <dot>
   <verse>29</verse><span>Yea, it shall come in a day when there shall be heard of fires, and

   earthquakes in divers places.

   <verse>31</verse><span>Yea, it shall come in a day when there shall be great pollutions
   upon the face of the earth; there shall be murders, and robbing, and
   lying, and deceivings, and whoredoms, and all manner of
   abominations; when there shall be many who will say, “Do this, or do
   that, and it mattereth not, for the Lord will uphold such at the
   last day.” But wo unto such, for they are in the gall of bitterness
   and in the bonds of iniquity.
  </span></dot>
  <dot>
   <verse>32</verse><span>Yea, it shall come in a day when there shall be churches built up

   forgiven of your sins.”
   </span><verse>33</verse><span>O ye wicked and perverse and stiffnecked people, why have ye built
   up churches unto yourselves to get gain? Why have ye transfigured

  Behold, look ye unto the revelations of God; for behold, the time

  envying, and strifes, and malice, and persecutions, and all manner
  of iniquities; and your churches, yea, even every one, have become
  polluted because of the pride of your hearts.

  Do ye suppose that ye shall dwell with him under a consciousness of your
  guilt? Do ye suppose that ye could be happy to dwell with that holy Being,
  when your souls are racked with a consciousness of guilt that ye have ever
  abused his laws?
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>Behold, I say unto you that ye
  would be more miserable to dwell with a holy and just God, under a
  consciousness of your filthiness before him, than ye would to dwell with
  the damned souls in hell.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>For behold, when ye
  shall be brought to see your nakedness before God, and also the glory of
  God, and the holiness of Jesus Christ, it will kindle a flame of
  unquenchable fire upon you.

  <verse>6</verse><span>O then ye unbelieving, turn ye unto the Lord; cry mightily unto the
  Father in the name of Jesus, that perhaps ye may be found spotless,
  pure, fair, and white, having been cleansed by the blood of the Lamb, at
  that great and last day.

  TO THE DENIERS OF GIFTS AND MIRACLES
 </span></blockheading>
 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>And again I speak unto you who deny the revelations of God, and say
  that they are done away, that there are no revelations, nor prophecies,
  nor gifts, nor healing, nor speaking with tongues, and the
  interpretation of tongues;
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>Behold I say unto you, he that denieth these things knoweth not the
  gospel of Christ; yea, he has not read the scriptures; if so, he does
  not understand them.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>For do we not read that God is the same yesterday, today, and forever,
  and in him there is no variableness neither shadow of changing?
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And now, if ye have imagined up unto yourselves a god who doth vary,
  and in whom there is shadow of changing, then have ye imagined up unto
  yourselves a god who is not a god of miracles.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>But behold, I will show unto you a god of miracles, even the God of
  Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; and it is that same
  God who created the heavens and the earth, and all things that in them
  are.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>Behold, he created Adam, and by Adam came the fall of man. And because
  of the fall of man came Jesus Christ, even the Father and the Son; and
  because of Jesus Christ came the redemption of man.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>And because of the redemption of man, which came by Jesus Christ, they
  are brought back into the presence of the Lord; yea, this is wherein all
  men are redeemed, because the death of Christ bringeth to pass the
  resurrection, which bringeth to pass a redemption from an endless sleep,
  from which sleep all men shall be awakened by the power of God when the
  trump shall sound; and they shall come forth, both small and great, and
  all shall stand before his bar, being redeemed and loosed from this
  eternal band of death, which death is a temporal death.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And then cometh the judgment of the Holy One upon them;
  and then cometh the time that he that is filthy shall be filthy still; and
  he that is righteous shall be righteous still; he that is happy shall be
  happy still; and he that is unhappy shall be unhappy still.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And now, O all ye that have imagined up unto yourselves a god who can
  do no miracles, I would ask of you, have all these things passed of
  which I have spoken? Has the end come yet? Behold I say unto you, nay;
  and God has not ceased to be a god of miracles.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>Behold, are not the things that God hath wrought marvelous in our
  eyes?
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  Yea, and who can comprehend the marvelous works of God?
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>Who shall say that it was not a miracle that by
  his word the heaven and the earth should be; and by the power of his word
  man was created of the dust of the earth; and by the power of his word
  have miracles been wrought?
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>And who shall say
  that Jesus Christ did not do many mighty miracles? And there were many
  mighty miracles wrought by the hands of the apostles.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And if there were miracles wrought then, why has God ceased to be a god
  of miracles and yet be an unchangeable Being?
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  And behold, I say unto you he changeth not; if so he would cease to be
  God; and he ceaseth not to be God, and is a god of miracles.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And the reason why he ceaseth to do miracles
  among the children of men is because that they dwindle in unbelief, and
  depart from the right way, and know not the God in whom they should trust.

  <verse>21</verse><span>Behold, I say unto you that whoso believeth in Christ, doubting
  nothing, whatsoever he shall ask the Father in the name of Christ it
  shall be granted him; and this promise is unto all, even unto the ends
  of the earth.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>For behold, thus said Jesus Christ, the Son of God, unto his disciples
  who should tarry, yea, and also to all his disciples, in the hearing of
  the multitude:</span><quote>
   <block><span>
    Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature;
    </span><verse>23</verse><span>and he that believeth and is baptized shall be
    saved, but he that believeth not shall be damned.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>24</verse><span>And these signs shall follow them that believe:</span><break></break>
    <dot><span>in my name shall they cast out devils;</span></dot>
    <dot><span>they shall speak with new tongues;</span></dot>
    <dot><span>they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them;</span></dot>
    <dot><span>they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover;</span></dot>
    <dot>
     <verse>25</verse><span>and whosoever shall believe in my name, doubting nothing, unto him will I confirm all my words, even unto the ends of the earth.</span></dot>

  <verse>26</verse><span>And now, behold, who can stand against the works of the Lord? Who can
  deny his sayings? Who will rise up against the almighty power of the
  Lord? Who will despise the works of the Lord? Who will despise the
  children of Christ?
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  Behold, all ye who are despisers of the works of the Lord, for ye shall
  wonder and perish.
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>O then despise not, and
  wonder not, but hearken unto the words of the Lord, and ask the Father in
  the name of Jesus for what things soever ye shall stand in need. Doubt
  not, but be believing, and begin as in times of old, and come unto the
  Lord with all your heart, and work out your own salvation with fear and
  trembling before him.
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>Be wise in the days of
  your probation; strip yourselves of all uncleanness; ask not, that ye may
  consume it on your lusts, but ask with a firmness unshaken, that ye will
  yield to no temptation, but that ye will serve the true and living God.
  </span><verse>29</verse><span>See that ye are not baptized unworthily; see
  that ye partake not of the sacrament of Christ unworthily; but see that ye
  do all things in worthiness, and do it in the name of Jesus Christ, the
  Son of the living God; and if ye do this, and endure to the end, ye will
  in nowise be cast out.

  forever, through faith on the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
