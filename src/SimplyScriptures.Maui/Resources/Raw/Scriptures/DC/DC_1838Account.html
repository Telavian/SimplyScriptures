    <chapter style="display: none">1</chapter>
    <block>
        <verse>1</verse><span>Owing to the many reports which have been put in circulation by evil-disposed
        and designing persons, in relation to the rise and progress of The Church
        of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, all of which have been designed by
        the authors thereof to militate against its character as a Church and its
        progress in the world—I have been induced to write this history, to disabuse
        the public mind, and put all inquirers after truth in
        possession of the facts, as they have transpired, in relation both to
        myself and the Church, so far as I have such facts in my possession.
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>In this history I shall present the various
        events in relation to this Church, in truth and righteousness, as they
        have transpired, or as they at present exist, being now [1838] the eighth
        year since the organization of the said Church.

        <verse>3</verse><span>I was born in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and five,
        on the twenty- third day of December, in the town of Sharon, Windsor county,
        State of Vermont…My father, Joseph Smith, Sen., left the State of Vermont,
        and moved to Palmyra, Ontario (now Wayne) county, in the State of New York,
        when I was in my tenth year, or
        thereabouts. In about four years after my father’s arrival in Palmyra,
        he moved with his family into Manchester in the same county of Ontario—
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>his family consisting of eleven souls, namely, my father, Joseph Smith;
        my mother, Lucy Smith (whose name, previous to her marriage, was Mack,
        daughter of Solomon Mack); my brothers, Alvin (who died November 19
        </span><superscript><span>th</span></superscript><span>
        1823, in the 26</span><superscript><span>th</span></superscript><span>
        year of his age), Hyrum, myself, Samuel Harrison, William, Don Carlos;
        and my sisters, Sophronia, Catherine, and Lucy.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>5</verse><span>Some time in the second year after our removal to Manchester, there was
        in the place
        where we lived an unusual excitement on the subject of religion. It commenced
        with the Methodists, but soon became general among all the sects in that
        region of country. Indeed, the whole district of country seemed affected
        by it, and great multitudes united
        themselves to the different religious parties, which created no small
        stir and division amongst the people, some crying, “Lo, here!” and others,
        “Lo, there!” Some were contending for the Methodist faith, some for the
        Presbyterian, and some for the Baptist.
        </span><verse>6</verse><span>For, notwithstanding the great love which the converts to these different
        faiths expressed at the time of their conversion, and the great zeal manifested
        by the respective clergy, who were active in getting up and promoting this
        extraordinary scene of religious feeling, in
        order to have everybody converted, as they were pleased to call it, let
        them join what sect they pleased; yet when the converts began to file off,
        some to one party and some to another, it was seen that the seemingly good
        feelings of both the priests and the converts were more pretended than
        real; for a scene of great confusion and bad feeling ensued—
        priest contending against priest, and convert against convert; so that
        all their good feelings one for another, if they ever had any, were entirely
        lost in a strife of words and a contest about opinions.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>7</verse><span>I was at this time in my fifteenth year. My father’s family was proselyted
        to the
        Presbyterian faith, and four of them joined that church, namely, my mother,
        Lucy; my brothers Hyrum and Samuel Harrison; and my sister Sophronia.
        </span><verse>8</verse><span>During this time of great excitement my mind was called up to serious
        reflection and great uneasiness; but though my feelings were deep and often
        poignant, still I kept myself aloof from all these parties, though I attended
        their several meetings as often as occasion would permit.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        In process of time my mind became somewhat partial to the Methodist sect,
        and I felt some desire to be united with them; but so great were the confusion
        and strife among the
        different denominations, that it was impossible for a person young as
        I was, and so
        unacquainted with men and things, to come to any certain conclusion who
        was right and who was wrong.
        </span><verse>9</verse><span>My mind at times was greatly excited, the cry and tumult were so great
        and incessant. The Presbyterians were most decided against the Baptists
        and Methodists, and used all the powers of both reason and sophistry to
        prove their errors, or, at least, to make the people think they were in
        error. On the other hand, the Baptists and Methodists in their turn were
        equally zealous in endeavoring to establish their own tenets and
        disprove all others.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>10</verse><span>In the midst of this war of words and tumult of opinions, I often said
        to myself: What is to be done? Who of all these parties are right; or,
        are they all wrong together? If any one of them be right, which is it,
        and how shall I know it?
        </span><verse>11</verse><span>While I was laboring under the extreme difficulties caused by the contests
        of these parties of religionists, I was one day
        reading the Epistle of James, first chapter and fifth verse, which reads:
        </span><quote>
            <reference>
                <referencenote><span>James 1:5</span></referencenote><span>If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men
                liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.
            </span></reference>
        </quote>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>12</verse><span>Never did any passage of scripture come with more power to the heart of
        man than this did at this time to mine. It seemed to enter with great force
        into every feeling of my heart. I reflected on it again and again, knowing
        that if any person needed wisdom from God, I did; for how to act I did
        not know, and unless I could get more wisdom than I then had, I would never
        know; for the teachers of religion of the different sects understood the
        same passages of scripture so differently as to destroy all confidence
        in settling the question by an appeal to the Bible.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>13</verse><span>At length I came to the conclusion that I must either remain in darkness
        and confusion, or else I must do as James directs, that is, ask of God.
        I at length came to the determination to “ask of God,” concluding that
        if he gave wisdom to them that lacked wisdom, and
        would give liberally, and not upbraid, I might venture.
        </span><verse>14</verse><span>So, in accordance with this, my determination to ask of God, I retired
        to the woods to make the attempt.
    </span></block>

    <heading><span>
        The vision in the grove
    </span></heading>

    <block><span>
        It was on the morning of a beautiful, clear day, early in the spring of
        eighteen hundred and twenty. It was the first time in my life that I had
        made such an attempt, for amidst all my anxieties I had never as yet made
        the attempt to pray vocally.
        </span><verse>15</verse><span>After I had retired to the place where I had previously designed to go,
        having looked around me, and finding myself alone, I kneeled down and began
        to offer up the desires of my heart to God.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        I had scarcely done so, when immediately I was seized upon by some power
        which entirely overcame me, and had such an astonishing influence over
        me as to bind my
        tongue so that I could not speak. Thick darkness gathered around me, and
        it seemed to me for a time as if I were doomed to sudden destruction.
        </span><verse>16</verse><span>But, exerting all my powers to call upon God to deliver me out of the
        power of this enemy which had seized upon me, and at the very moment when
        I was ready to sink into despair and abandon myself to
        destruction—not to an imaginary ruin, but to the power of some actual
        being from the
        unseen world, who had such marvelous power as I had never before felt
        in any being—just at this moment of great alarm, I saw a pillar of light
        exactly over my head, above the
        brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me.
        </span><verse>17</verse><span>It no sooner appeared than I found myself delivered from the enemy which
        held me bound.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and
        glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake
        unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other:
        </span><quote><span>
            This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!
        </span></quote>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>18</verse><span>My object in going to inquire of the Lord was to know which of all the
        sects was right, that I might know which to join. No sooner, therefore,
        did I get possession of myself, so as to be able to speak, than I asked
        the Personages who stood above me in the light, which of all the sects
        was right (for at this time it had never entered into my heart that all
        were
        wrong)—and which I should join.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>19</verse><span>I was answered that I must join none of them, for they were all wrong;
        and the
        Personage who addressed me said that all their creeds were an abomination
        in his sight; that those professors were all corrupt; that:
        </span><quote>
            <reference>
                <referencenote><span>Isaiah 29:13</span></referencenote><span>They draw near to me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me,
                they teach for doctrines the commandments of men, having a form of godliness,
                but they deny the power thereof.

    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>20</verse><span>He again forbade me to join with any of them; and many other things did
        he say unto me, which I cannot write at this time.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        When I came to myself again, I found myself lying on my back, looking
        up into heaven. When the light had departed, I had no strength; but soon
        recovering in some degree, I went home. And as I leaned up to the fireplace,
        mother inquired what the matter was. I replied, “Never mind, all is well—I
        am well enough off.” I then said to my mother, “I have learned for myself
        that Presbyterianism is not true.”

        Persecution
    </span></heading>

    <block><span>
        It seems as though the adversary was aware, at a very early period of
        my life, that I was destined to prove a disturber and an annoyer of his
        kingdom; else why should the powers of darkness combine against me? Why
        the opposition and persecution that arose against me, almost in my infancy?
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>21</verse><span>Some few days after I had this vision, I happened to be in company with
        one of the
        Methodist preachers, who was very active in the before mentioned religious
        excitement; and, conversing with him on the subject of religion, I took
        occasion to give him an
        account of the vision which I had had.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        I was greatly surprised at his behavior; he treated my communication not
        only lightly, but with great contempt, saying it was all of the devil,
        that there were no such things as
        visions or revelations in these days; that all such things had ceased
        with the apostles, and that there would never be any more of them.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>22</verse><span>I soon found, however, that my telling the story had excited a great deal
        of prejudice against me among professors of religion, and was the cause
        of great persecution, which continued to increase; and though I was an
        obscure boy, only between fourteen and fifteen years of age, and my circumstances
        in life such as to make a boy of no consequence in the world, yet men of
        high standing would take notice sufficient to excite the public mind against
        me, and create a bitter persecution; and this was common among all the
        sects—all united to persecute me.
        </span><verse>23</verse><span>It caused me serious reflection then, and often has since, how
        very strange it was that an obscure boy, of a little over fourteen years
        of age, and one, too, who was doomed to the necessity of obtaining a scanty
        maintenance by his daily labor, should be thought a character of sufficient
        importance to attract the attention of the great ones of the most popular
        sects of the day, and in a manner to create in them a spirit of the most
        bitter persecution and reviling. But strange or not, so it was, and it
        was often the
        cause of great sorrow to myself.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>24</verse><span>However, it was nevertheless a fact that I had beheld a vision. I have
        thought since, that I felt much like Paul, when he made his defense before
        King Agrippa, and related the
        account of the vision he had when he saw a light, and heard a voice; but
        still there were
        but few who believed him; some said he was dishonest, others said he was
        mad; and he
        was ridiculed and reviled. But all this did not destroy the reality of
        his vision. He had seen a vision, he knew he had, and all the persecution
        under heaven could not make it
        otherwise; and though they should persecute him unto death, yet he knew,
        and would know to his latest breath, that he had both seen a light and
        heard a voice speaking unto him, and all the world could not make him think
        or believe otherwise.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>25</verse><span>So it was with me. I had actually seen a light, and in the midst of that
        light I saw two
        Personages, and they did in reality speak to me; and though I was hated
        and persecuted for saying that I had seen a vision, yet it was true; and
        while they were persecuting me,
        reviling me, and speaking all manner of evil against me falsely for so
        saying, I was led to say in my heart: Why persecute me for telling the
        truth? I have actually seen a vision; and who am I that I can withstand
        God, or why does the world think to make me deny what I have actually seen?
        For I had seen a vision; I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I
        could not deny it, neither dared I do it; at least I knew that by so doing
        I would offend God, and come under condemnation.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>26</verse><span>I had now got my mind satisfied so far as the sectarian world was concerned—that
        it was not my duty to join with any of them, but to continue as I was until
        further directed. I had found the testimony of James to be true—that a
        man who lacked wisdom might ask of God, and obtain, and not be upbraided.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>27</verse><span>I continued to pursue my common vocations in life until the twenty-first
        of September, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-three, all the time
        suffering severe persecution at the hands of all classes of men, both religious
        and irreligious, because I continued to affirm that I had seen a vision.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>28</verse><span>During the space of time which intervened between the time I had the vision
        and the year eighteen hundred and twenty-three—having been forbidden to
        join any of the
        religious sects of the day, and being of very tender years, and persecuted
        by those who ought to have been my friends and to have treated me kindly,
        and if they supposed me to be deluded to have endeavored in a proper and
        affectionate manner to have reclaimed me—I was left to all kinds of temptations;
        and, mingling with all kinds of society, I
        frequently fell into many foolish errors, and displayed the weakness of
        youth, and the foibles of human nature; which, I am sorry to say, led me
        into divers temptations,
        offensive in the sight of God. In making this confession, no one need
        suppose me guilty of any great or malignant sins. A disposition to commit
        such was never in my nature. But I was guilty of levity, and sometimes
        associated with jovial company, etc., not consistent
        with that character which ought to be maintained by one who was called
        of God as I had been. But this will not seem very strange to anyone who
        recollects my youth, and is
        acquainted with my native cheery temperament.

        An angel visits in the night
    </span></heading>

    <block>
        <verse>29</verse><span>In consequence of these things, I often felt condemned for my weakness
        and imperfections; when, on the evening of the above-mentioned twenty-first
        of September, after I had retired to my bed for the night, I betook myself
        to prayer and supplication to Almighty God for forgiveness of all my sins
        and follies, and also for a manifestation to me, that I might know of my
        state and standing before him; for I had full confidence in obtaining a
        divine manifestation, as I previously had one.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>30</verse><span>While I was thus in the act of calling upon God, I discovered a light
        appearing in my room, which continued to increase until the room was lighter
        than at noonday, when immediately a personage appeared at my bedside, standing
        in the air, for his feet did not touch the floor.
        </span><verse>31</verse><span>He had on a loose robe of most exquisite whiteness. It was a whiteness
        beyond anything earthly I had ever seen; nor do I believe that any earthly
        thing could be made to appear so exceedingly white and brilliant. His hands
        were naked, and his arms also, a little above the wrist; so, also, were
        his feet naked, as were his legs, a little above the ankles. His head and
        neck were also bare. I could discover that he had no other clothing on
        but this robe, as it was open, so that I could see into his bosom.
        </span><verse>32</verse><span>Not only was his robe
        exceedingly white, but his whole person was glorious beyond description,
        and his
        countenance truly like lightning. The room was exceedingly light, but
        not so very bright as immediately around his person. When I first looked
        upon him, I was afraid; but the fear soon left me.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>33</verse><span>He called me by name, and said unto me that he was a messenger sent from
        the presence of God to me, and that his name was
        </span><ddunder>
            <manuscript><span>Nephi</span></manuscript><span>
            Moroni
        </span></ddunder><span>; that God had a work for me to do; and that my name should be had for
        good and evil among all nations, kindreds, and tongues, or that it should
        be both good and evil spoken of among all people.
        </span><verse>34</verse><span>He said there was a book deposited, written upon gold plates, giving an
        account of the former inhabitants of this continent, and the source from
        whence they sprang. He also said that the fulness of the everlasting Gospel
        was contained in it, as delivered by the Savior to the ancient inhabitants;
        </span><verse>35</verse><span>also, that there were two stones in silver bows—and these stones, fastened
        to a breastplate, constituted what is called the Urim and Thummim—deposited
        with the
        plates; and the possession and use of these stones were what constituted
        “seers” in ancient or former times; and that God had prepared them for
        the purpose of translating the book.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>36</verse><span>After telling me these things, he commenced quoting the prophecies of
        the Old
        Testament. He first quoted part of the third chapter of Malachi; and he
        quoted also the fourth or last chapter of the same prophecy, though with
        a little variation from the way it reads in our Bibles. Instead of quoting
        the first verse as it reads in our books, he quoted it thus:
        </span><quote>
            <reference>
                <referencenote><span>Malachi 4:1</span></referencenote>
                <verse>37</verse><span>For behold, the day cometh that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud,
                yea, and all that do wickedly shall burn as stubble; for they that come
                shall burn them, saith the Lord of Hosts, that it shall leave them neither
                root nor branch.

        </quote>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>38</verse><span>And again, he quoted the fifth verse thus:

            <reference>
                <referencenote><span>Malachi 4:5</span></referencenote><span>Behold, I will reveal unto you the Priesthood, by the hand of Elijah the

        <verse>40</verse><span>In addition to these, he quoted the eleventh chapter of Isaiah, saying
        that it was about to be fulfilled. He quoted also the third chapter of
        Acts, twenty-second and twenty-third
        verses, precisely as they stand in our New Testament. He said that that
        prophet was Christ; but the day had not yet come when “they who would not
        hear his voice should be cut off from among the people,” but soon would
        come.
        </span><verse>41</verse><span>He also quoted the second
        chapter of Joel, from the twenty-eighth verse to the last. He also said
        that this was not yet fulfilled, but was soon to be. And he further stated
        that the fulness of the Gentiles was soon to come in. He quoted many other
        passages of scripture, and offered many
        explanations which cannot be mentioned here.

        <verse>42</verse><span>Again, he told me, that when I got those plates of which he had spoken—for
        the time that they should be obtained was not yet fulfilled—I should not
        show them to any person; neither the breastplate with the Urim and Thummim;
        only to those to whom I should be commanded to show them; if I did I should
        be destroyed. While he was conversing with
        me about the plates, the vision was opened to my mind that I could see
        the place where the plates were deposited, and that so clearly and distinctly
        that I knew the place again when I visited it.

        <verse>43</verse><span>After this communication, I saw the light in the room begin to gather
        immediately around the person of him who had been speaking to me, and it
        continued to do so until the room was again left dark, except just around
        him; when, instantly I saw, as it were, a conduit open right up into heaven,
        and he ascended till he entirely disappeared, and the room was left as
        it had been before this heavenly light had made its appearance.

        <verse>44</verse><span>I lay musing on the singularity of the scene, and marveling greatly at
        what had been told to me by this extraordinary messenger; when, in the
        midst of my meditation, I suddenly discovered that my room was again beginning
        to get lighted, and in an instant, as it were, the same heavenly messenger
        was again by my bedside.
        </span><verse>45</verse><span>He commenced, and again
        related the very same things which he had done at his first visit, without
        the least
        variation; which having done, he informed me of great judgments which
        were coming upon the earth, with great desolations by famine, sword, and
        pestilence; and that these grievous judgments would come on the earth in
        this generation. Having related these things, he again ascended as he had
        done before.
        </span><verse>46</verse><span>By this time, so deep were the
        impressions made on my mind, that sleep had fled from my eyes, and I lay
        overwhelmed in astonishment at what I had both seen and heard.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        But what was my surprise when again I beheld the same messenger at my
        bedside, and heard him rehearse or repeat over again to me the same things
        as before; and added a
        caution to me, telling me that Satan would try to tempt me (in consequence
        of the
        indigent circumstances of my father’s family), to get the plates for the
        purpose of getting rich. This he forbade me, saying that I must have no
        other object in view in getting the plates but to glorify God, and must
        not be influenced by any other motive than that of building his kingdom;
        otherwise I could not get them.
        </span><verse>47</verse><span>After this third visit, he again
        ascended into heaven as before, and I was again left to ponder on the
        strangeness of what I had just experienced; when almost immediately after
        the heavenly messenger had
        ascended from me for the third time, the cock crowed, and I found that
        day was approaching, so that our interviews must have occupied the whole
        of that night.

    <block>
        <verse>48</verse><span>I shortly after arose from my bed, and, as usual, went to the necessary
        labors of the day; but, in attempting to work as at other times, I found
        my strength so exhausted as to render me entirely unable. My father, who
        was laboring along with me, discovered something to be wrong with me, and
        told me to go home. I started with the intention of going to the house;
        but, in attempting to cross the fence out of the field where we were, my
        strength entirely failed me, and I fell helpless on the ground, and for
        a time was quite unconscious of anything.
        </span><verse>49</verse><span>The first thing that I can recollect was a voice speaking unto me, calling
        me by name. I looked up, and beheld the same messenger standing over my
        head, surrounded by light as before. He then again related unto me all
        that he had related to me the previous night, and commanded me to go to
        my father and tell him of the vision and
        commandments which I had received.
        </span><verse>50</verse><span>I obeyed; I returned to my father in the field, and rehearsed the whole
        matter to him. He replied to me that it was of God, and told me to go and
        do as commanded by the messenger.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        I left the field, and went to the place where the messenger had told me
        the plates were deposited; and owing to the distinctness of the vision
        which I had had concerning it, I
        knew the place the instant that I arrived there.
        </span><verse>51</verse><span>Convenient to the village of Manchester, Ontario county, New York, stands
        a hill of considerable size, and the most elevated of any
        in the neighborhood. On the west side of this hill, not far from the top,
        under a stone of considerable size, lay the plates, deposited in a stone
        box. This stone was thick and
        rounding in the middle on the upper side, and thinner towards the edges,
        so that the middle part of it was visible above the ground, but the edge
        all around was covered with
        earth.
        </span><verse>52</verse><span>Having removed the earth, I obtained a lever, which I got fixed under
        the edge of the stone, and with a little exertion raised it up.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        I looked in, and there indeed did I behold the plates, the Urim and Thummim,
        and the breastplate, as stated by the messenger. The box in which they
        lay was formed by laying stones together in some kind of cement. In the
        bottom of the box were laid two stones
        crossways of the box, and on these stones lay the plates and the other
        things with them.
        </span><verse>53</verse><span>I made an attempt to take them out, but was forbidden by the messenger,
        and was again informed that the time for bringing them forth had not yet
        arrived, neither would it, until four years from that time; but he told
        me that I should come to that place precisely in one year from that time,
        and that he would there meet with me, and that I should continue to do
        so until the time should come for obtaining the plates.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>54</verse><span>Accordingly, as I had been commanded, I went at the end of each year,
        and at each time I found the same messenger there, and received instruction
        and intelligence from him at each of our interviews, respecting what the
        Lord was going to do, and how and in what manner his kingdom was to be
        conducted in the last days.

        The gold plates
    </span></heading>

    <block>
        <verse>55</verse><span>As my father’s worldly circumstances were very limited, we were under
        the necessity of laboring with our hands, hiring out by day’s work and
        otherwise, as we could get opportunity. Sometimes we were at home, and
        sometimes abroad, and by continuous
        labor were enabled to get a comfortable maintenance.
        </span><verse>56</verse><span>In the year 1823 my father’s
        family met with a great affliction by the death of my eldest brother,
        Alvin. In the month of October, 1825, I hired with an old gentleman by
        the name of Josiah Stoal, who lived in Chenango county, State of New York.
        He had heard something of a silver mine having been opened by the Spaniards
        in Harmony, Susquehanna county, State of Pennsylvania; and had, previous
        to my hiring to him, been digging, in order, if possible, to discover the
        mine. After I went to live with him, he took me, with the rest of his hands,
        to dig for the silver mine, at which I continued to work for nearly a month,
        without success in our
        undertaking, and finally I prevailed with the old gentleman to cease digging
        after it. Hence arose the very prevalent story of my having been a money-digger.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>57</verse><span>During the time that I was thus employed, I was put to board with a Mr.
        Isaac Hale, of that place; it was there I first saw my wife (his daughter),
        Emma Hale. On the 18</span><superscript><span>th</span></superscript><span>
        of January, 1827, we were married, while I was yet employed in the service
        of Mr. Stoal.
        </span><verse>58</verse><span>Owing to my continuing to assert that I had seen a vision, persecution
        still followed me, and my wife’s father’s family were very much opposed
        to our being married. I was,
        therefore, under the necessity of taking her elsewhere; so we went and
        were married at the house of Squire Tarbill, in South Bainbridge, Chenango
        county, New York. Immediately after my marriage, I left Mr. Stoal’s, and
        went to my father’s, and farmed with him that season.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>59</verse><span>At length the time arrived for obtaining the plates, the Urim and Thummim,
        and the breastplate. On the twenty-second day of September, one thousand
        eight hundred and twenty-seven, having gone as usual at the end of another
        year to the place where they were deposited, the same heavenly messenger
        delivered them up to me with this charge: that I should be responsible
        for them; that if I should let them go carelessly, or through
        any neglect of mine, I should be cut off; but that if I would use all
        my endeavors to
        preserve them, until he, the messenger, should call for them, they should
        be protected.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>60</verse><span>I soon found out the reason why I had received such strict charges to
        keep them safe, and why it was that the messenger had said that when I
        had done what was required at my hand, he would call for them. For no sooner
        was it known that I had them, than the most strenuous exertions were used
        to get them from me. Every stratagem that could be
        invented was resorted to for that purpose. The persecution became more
        bitter and severe than before, and multitudes were on the alert continually
        to get them from me if possible.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        But by the wisdom of God, they remained safe in my hands, until I had
        accomplished by them what was required at my hand. When, according to arrangements,
        the messenger
        called for them, I delivered them up to him; and he has them in his charge
        until this day, being the second day of May, one thousand eight hundred
        and thirty-eight.

        Translating

        <verse>61</verse><span>The excitement, however, still continued, and rumor with her thousand
        tongues was all the time employed in circulating falsehoods about my father’s
        family, and about myself. If I were to relate a thousandth part of them,
        it would fill up volumes. The persecution, however, became so intolerable
        that I was under the necessity of leaving Manchester, and going with my
        wife to Susquehanna county, in the State of Pennsylvania. While
        preparing to start—being very poor, and the persecution so heavy upon
        us that there was no probability that we would ever be otherwise—in the
        midst of our afflictions we found a friend in a gentleman by the name of
        Martin Harris, who came to us and gave me fifty dollars to assist us on
        our journey. Mr. Harris was a resident of Palmyra township, Wayne county,
        in the State of New York, and a farmer of respectability.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>62</verse><span>By this timely aid was I enabled to reach the place of my destination
        in Pennsylvania; and immediately after my arrival there I commenced copying
        the characters off the plates.
        I copied a considerable number of them, and by means of the Urim and Thummim
        I translated some of them, which I did between the time I arrived at the
        house of my wife’s father, in the month of December, and the February following.
        </span><verse>63</verse><span>Sometime in this month of February, the aforementioned Mr. Martin Harris
        came to our place, got the characters which I had drawn off the plates,
        and started with them to the city of New York. For
        what took place relative to him and the characters, I refer to his own
        account of the circumstances, as he related them to me after his return,
        which was as follows:
        </span><quote>
            <block>
                <verse>64</verse><span>I went to the city of New York, and presented the characters which had
                been translated, with the translation thereof, to Professor Charles Anthon,
                a gentleman
                celebrated for his literary attainments. Professor Anthon stated that
                the translation was correct, more so than any he had before seen translated
                from the Egyptian. I then showed him those which were not yet translated,
                and he said that they were Egyptian,
                Chaldaic, Assyriac, and Arabic; and he said they were true characters.
                He gave me a
                certificate, certifying to the people of Palmyra that they were true characters,
                and that the translation of such of them as had been translated was also
                correct.
                I took the certificate and put it into my pocket, and was just leaving
                the house, when Mr. Anthon called me back, and asked me how the young man
                found out that there were gold plates in the place where he found them.
                I answered that an angel of God had revealed it unto him.
                </span><verse>65</verse><span>He then said to me, “Let me see that certificate.”
            </span></block>

            <block><span>
                I accordingly took it out of my pocket and gave it to him, when he took
                it and tore it to pieces, saying that there was no such thing now as ministering
                of angels, and that if I would bring the plates to him he would translate
                them. I informed him that part of the plates were sealed, and that I was
                forbidden to bring them. He replied, “I cannot
                read a sealed book.” I left him and went to Dr. Mitchell, who sanctioned
                what Professor Anthon had said respecting both the characters and the translation.

        day of April, 1829, Oliver Cowdery came to my house, until which time

        in the neighborhood where my father resided, and my father being one of those
        who sent to the school, he went to board for a season at his house, and
        while there the family related to him the circumstances of my having received

        <verse>68</verse><span>We still continued the work of translation, when, in the ensuing month

        of the Lord respecting baptism for the remission of sins, that we found
        mentioned in the translation of the plates.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        While we were thus employed, praying and calling upon the Lord, a messenger
        from heaven descended in a cloud of light, and having laid his hands upon
        us, he ordained us, saying:
        </span><quote>
            <verse>69</verse><span>Upon you my fellow servants, in the name of Messiah, I confer the Priesthood
            of Aaron, which holds the keys of the ministering of angels, and of the
            gospel of
            repentance, and of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; and
            this shall never be taken again from the earth until the sons of Levi do
            offer again an offering unto the Lord in righteousness.

        <verse>70</verse><span>He said this Aaronic Priesthood had not the power of laying on hands for

        I should baptize Oliver Cowdery, and that afterwards he should baptize
        me.

    <block>
        <verse>72</verse><span>The messenger who visited us on this occasion and conferred this Priesthood
        upon us, said that his name was John, the same that is called John the
        Baptist in the New
        Testament, and that he acted under the direction of Peter, James and John,
        who held the keys of the Priesthood of Melchizedek, which Priesthood, he
        said, would in due time be conferred on us, and that I should be called
        the first Elder of the Church, and he (Oliver Cowdery) the second. It was
        on the fifteenth day of May, 1829, that we were ordained under the hand
        of this messenger, and baptized.

        <verse>73</verse><span>Immediately on our coming up out of the water after we had been baptized,
        we experienced great and glorious blessings from our Heavenly Father. No
        sooner had I baptized Oliver Cowdery, than the Holy Ghost fell upon him,
        and he stood up and
        prophesied many things which should shortly come to pass. And again, so
        soon as I had been baptized by him, I also had the spirit of prophecy,
        when, standing up, I prophesied concerning the rise of this Church, and
        many other things connected with the Church, and this generation of the
        children of men. We were filled with the Holy Ghost, and
        rejoiced in the God of our salvation.
        </span><verse>74</verse><span>Our minds being now enlightened, we began to have the scriptures laid
        open to our understandings, and the true meaning and intention of
        their more mysterious passages revealed unto us in a manner which we never
        could attain to previously, nor ever before had thought of.

    <block><span>
        In the meantime we were forced to keep secret the circumstances of having
        received the Priesthood and our having been baptized, owing to a spirit
        of persecution which had
        already manifested itself in the neighborhood.
        </span><verse>75</verse><span>We had been threatened with being mobbed, from time to time, and this,
        too, by professors of religion. And their intentions of mobbing us were
        only counteracted by the influence of my wife’s father’s family (under
        Divine providence), who had become very friendly to me, and who were opposed
        to mobs, and were willing that I should be allowed to continue the work
        of translation
        without interruption; and therefore offered and promised us protection
        from all unlawful proceedings, as far as in them lay.

                supersede my present design; I shall therefore defer this to a future
                period, and, as I said in the introduction, pass more directly to some
                few incidents immediately connected with the rise of this Church, which
                may be entertaining to some thousands who have stepped forward, amid the
                frowns of bigots and the calumny of hypocrites, and embraced the Gospel
                of Christ.

                No men, in their sober senses, could translate and write the directions
                given to the Nephites from the mouth of the Savior, of the precise manner
                in which men should build up His Church, and especially when corruption
                had spread an uncertainty over all forms and systems practiced among men,
                without desiring a privilege of showing the willingness of the heart by
                being buried in the liquid grave, to answer a ‘good conscience by the resurrection
                of Jesus Christ.’

                After writing the account given of the Savior’s ministry to the remnant
                of the seed of Jacob, upon this continent, it was easy to be seen, as the
                prophet said it would be, that darkness covered the earth and gross darkness
                the minds of the people. On reflecting further it was as easy to be seen
                that amid the great strife and noise concerning
                religion, none had authority from God to administer the ordinances of
                the Gospel. For the question might be asked, have men authority to administer
                in the name of Christ, who deny revelations, when His testimony is no less
                than the spirit of prophecy, and His religion based, built, and sustained
                by immediate revelations, in all ages of the
                world when He has had a people on earth? If these facts were buried, and
                carefully concealed by men whose craft would have been in danger if once
                permitted to shine in the faces of men, they were no longer to us; and
                we only waited for the commandment to be given ‘Arise and be baptized.’

            <block><span>
                This was not long desired before it was realized. The Lord, who is rich
                in mercy, and ever willing to answer the consistent prayer of the humble,
                after we had called upon Him in a fervent manner, aside from the abodes
                of men, condescended to manifest to us His will. On a sudden, as from the
                midst of eternity, the voice of the Redeemer spake peace to us, while the
                veil was parted and the angel of God came down clothed
                with glory, and delivered the anxiously looked-for message, and the keys
                of the Gospel of repentance. What joy! what wonder! what amazement! While
                the world was racked and distracted—while millions were groping as the
                blind for the wall, and while all men were resting upon uncertainty, as
                a general mass, our eyes beheld, our ears heard, as in the ‘blaze of day’;
                yes, more—above the glitter of the May sunbeam, which then shed its brilliancy
                over the face of nature! Then his voice, though mild, pierced to the center,
                and his words, ‘I am thy fellow-servant,’ dispelled every fear. We listened,
                we gazed, we admired! ’Twas the voice of an angel from glory, ’twas a message
                from the Most High! And as we heard we rejoiced, while His love enkindled
                upon our souls, and we were wrapped in the vision of the Almighty! Where
                was room for doubt? Nowhere; uncertainty had fled, doubt had sunk no more
                to rise, while fiction and deception had fled forever!

                But, dear brother, think, further think for a moment, what joy filled
                our hearts, and with what surprise we must have bowed, (for who would not
                have bowed the knee for such a blessing?) when we received under his hand
                the Holy Priesthood as he said:
                </span><quote><span>
                    Upon you my fellow-servants, in the name of Messiah, I confer this Priesthood
                    and this authority, which shall remain upon earth, that the Sons of Levi
                    may yet offer an offering unto the Lord in righteousness!

                I shall not attempt to paint to you the feelings of this heart, nor the
                majestic beauty and glory which surrounded us on this occasion; but you
                will believe me when I say, that earth, nor men, with the eloquence of
                time, cannot begin to clothe language in as interesting and sublime a manner
                as this holy personage. No; nor has this earth power to give the joy, to
                bestow the peace, or comprehend the wisdom which was contained in each
                sentence as they were delivered by the power of the Holy Spirit! Man may
                deceive his fellow-men, deception may follow deception, and the children
                of the wicked one may have power to seduce the foolish and untaught, till
                naught but
                fiction feeds the many, and the fruit of falsehood carries in its current
                the giddy to the grave; but one touch with the finger of his love, yes,
                one ray of glory from the upper world, or one word from the mouth of the
                Savior, from the bosom of eternity, strikes it all into insignificance,
                and blots it forever from the mind. The assurance that we
                were in the presence of an angel, the certainty that we heard the voice
                of Jesus, and the truth unsullied as it flowed from a pure personage, dictated
                by the will of God, is to me past description, and I shall ever look upon
                this expression of the Savior’s goodness with wonder and thanksgiving while
                I am permitted to tarry; and in those mansions where perfection dwells
                and sin never comes, I hope to adore in that day
                which shall never cease.
