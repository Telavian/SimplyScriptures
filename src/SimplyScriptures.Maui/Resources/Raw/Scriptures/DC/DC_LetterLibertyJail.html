        To the Church of Latter-day Saints at Quincy, Illinois, and scattered
        abroad, and to Bishop Partridge in particular;
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Your humble servant, Joseph Smith, Jun., prisoner for the Lord Jesus Christ's
        sake, and for the Saints, taken and held by the power of mobocracy, under
        the exterminating reign of his excellency, the Governor Lilburn W. Boggs,
        in company with his fellow prisoners and beloved brethren, Caleb Baldwin,
        Lyman Wight, Hyrum Smith, and Alexander McRae, send unto you all greeting.
        May the grace of God the Father, and of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ,
        rest upon you all, and abide with you forever. May knowledge be multiplied
        unto you by the mercy of God. And may faith and virtue, and knowledge and
        temperance, and patience and godliness, and brotherly kindness and charity
        be in you and abound, that you may not be barren in anything, nor unfruitful.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        For inasmuch as we know that the most of you are well acquainted with
        the wrongs and the high-handed injustice and cruelty that are practiced
        upon us; whereas we have been taken prisoners charged falsely with every
        kind of evil, and a strong guard, who
        continually watch day and night as indefatigable as the devil does in
        tempting and laying snares for the people of God.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Therefore, dearly beloved Brethren, we are the more ready and willing
        to lay claim to your fellowship and love. For our circumstances are calculated
        to awaken our spirits to a sacred remembrance of everything, and we think
        that yours are also, and that nothing therefore can separate us from the
        love of God and fellowship one with another; and that
        every species of wickedness and cruelty practiced upon us will only tend
        to bind our hearts together and seal them together in love. We have no
        need to say to you that we are held in bonds without cause, neither is
        it needful that you say unto us. We are driven from our homes and smitten
        without cause. We mutually understand that if the inhabitants of the state
        of Missouri had let the Saints alone, and had been as desirable of peace
        as they were, there would have been nothing but peace and quietude in the
        state unto this day; we
        should not have been in this hell, surrounded with demons (if not those
        who are damned, they are those who shall be damned) and where we are compelled
        to hear nothing but
        blasphemous oaths, and witness a scene of blasphemy, and drunkenness and
        hypocrisy, and debaucheries of every description.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        And again the cries of orphans and widows would not have ascended up to
        God against them. Nor would innocent blood have stained the soil of Missouri.
        But oh! the
        unrelenting hand! The inhumanity and murderous disposition of this people!
        It shocks all nature; it beggars and defies all description; it is a tale
        of woe; a lamentable tale; yea a
        sorrowful tale; too much to tell; too much for contemplation; too much
        for human beings; it cannot be found among the heathens; it cannot be found
        among the nations where kings and tyrants are enthroned; it cannot be found
        among the savages of the wilderness; yea, and I think it cannot be found
        among the wild and ferocious beasts of the forest—that a man should be
        mangled for sport! women be robbed of all that they have—their last morsel
        for subsistence, and then be violated to gratify the hellish desires of
        the mob, and
        finally left to perish with their helpless offspring clinging around their
        necks.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        But this is not all. After a man is dead, he must be dug up from his grave
        and mangled to pieces, for no other purpose than to gratify their spleen
        against the religion of God.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        They practice these things upon the Saints, who have done them no wrong,
        who are innocent and virtuous; who loved the Lord their God, and were willing
        to forsake all things for Christ's sake. These things are awful to
        relate, but they are verily true. It must needs be that offenses come,
        but woe unto them by whom they come.

                eye pierce; let thy pavilion be taken up; let thy
                hiding place no longer be covered; let thine ear be inclined; let thine

    <block><span>
        Dearly and beloved Brethren, we see that perilous times have come, as
        was testified of. We may look, then, with most perfect assurance, for the
        fulfillment of all those things that have been written, and with more confidence
        than ever before, lift up our eyes to the luminary of day, and say in our
        hearts, Soon thou wilt veil thy blushing face. He that said "Let there
        be Light," and there was light, has spoken this word. And again, thou
        moon, thou dimmer light, thou luminary of night, shalt turn to blood.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        We see that everything is being fulfilled; and that the time shall soon
        come when the Son of Man shall descend in the clouds of heaven. Our hearts
        do not shrink, neither are our spirits altogether broken by the grievous
        yoke which is put upon us. We know that God will have our oppressors in
        derision; that He will laugh at their calamity, and mock when their fear
        comes.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        O that we could be with you, Brethren, and unbosom our feelings to you!
        We would tell, that we should have been liberated at the time Elder Rigdon
        was, on the writ of habeas corpus, had not our own lawyers interpreted
        the law, contrary to what it reads, against us; which prevented us from
        introducing our evidence before the mock court.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        They have done us much harm from the beginning. They have of late acknowledged
        that the law was misconstrued, and tantalized our feelings with it, and
        have entirely forsaken us, and have forfeited their oaths and their bonds;
        and we have a come-back on them, for they are co-workers with the mob.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        As nigh as we can learn, the public mind has been for a long time turning
        in our favor, and the majority in now friendly; and the lawyers can no
        longer browbeat us by saying that this or that is a matter of public opinion,
        for public opinion is not willing to brook it; for it is beginning to look
        with feelings of indignation against our oppressors, and to say that the
        Mormons were not in the fault in the least. We think that truth, honor,
        virtue and
        innocence will eventually come out triumphant. We should have taken a
        habeas corpus before the high judge and escaped the mob in a summary way;
        but unfortunately for us, the timber of the wall being very hard, our auger
        handles gave out, and hindered us longer
        than we expected; we applied to a friend, and a very slight incautious
        act gave rise to some suspicions, and before we could fully succeed, our
        plan was discovered; we had everything in readiness, but the last stone,
        and we could have made our escape in one minute, and should have succeeded
        admirably, had it not been for a little imprudence or over-anxiety on the
        part of our friend.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        The sheriff and jailer did not blame us for our attempt; it was a fine
        breach, and cost the county a round sum; but public opinion says that we
        ought to have been permitted to have made our escape; that then the disgrace
        would have been on us, but now it must come on the state; that there cannot
        be any charge sustained against us; and that the
        conduct of the mob, the murders committed at Haun's Mills, and the
        exterminating order of the governor, and the one-sided, rascally proceedings
        of the legislature, have damned the state of Missouri to all eternity.
        I would just name also that General Atchison has proved himself as contemptible
        as any of them.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        We have tried for a long time to get our lawyers to draw us some petitions
        to the supreme judges of this state, but they utterly refused. We have
        examined the law, and drawn the petitions ourselves, and have obtained
        abundance of proof to counteract all the testimony that was against us,
        so that if the supreme judge does not grant us our liberty, he has to act
        without cause, contrary to honor, evidence, law or justice, sheerly to
        please the devil, but we hope better things and trust before many days
        God will so order our case, that we shall be set at liberty and take up
        our habitation with the saints.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        We received some letters last evening—one from Emma, one from Don C. Smith,
        and one from Bishop Partridge—all breathing a kind and consoling spirit.
        We were much
        gratified with their contents. We had been a long time without information;
        and when we read those letters they were to our souls as the gentle air
        is refreshing, but our joy was mingled with grief, because of the sufferings
        of the poor and much injured saints. And we need not say to you that the
        floodgates of our hearts were lifted and our eyes were a
        fountain of tears, but those who have not been enclosed in the walls of
        prison without
        cause or provocation, can have but little idea how sweet the voice of
        a friend is; one token of friendship from any source whatever awakens and
        calls into action every sympathetic
        feeling; it brings up in an instant everything that is passed; it seizes
        the present with the avidity of lightning; it grasps after the future with
        the fierceness of a tiger; it moves the mind backward and forward, from
        one thing to another, until finally all enmity, malice and hatred, and
        past differences, misunderstandings and mismanagements are slain
        victorious at the feet of hope; and when the heart is sufficiently contrite,
        then the voice of inspiration steals along and whispers:

                <verse>11</verse><span>And they who do charge thee with transgression, their hope shall be blasted,

                burning rays of the rising sun;
                </span><verse>12</verse><span>and also that God has set his hand and seal to change the times and seasons,
                and to blind their minds, that they may not understand his marvelous workings;
                that he may prove them also and take them in their own craftiness;
                </span><verse>13</verse><span>also because their hearts are corrupted, and the things which they are
                willing to bring upon others, and love to have others suffer, may come
                upon themselves to the very uttermost;
                </span><verse>14</verse><span>that they may be disappointed also, and their hopes may be cut off;
                </span><verse>15</verse><span>and not many years hence, that they and their posterity
                shall be swept from under heaven, says God, that not one of them is left
                to stand by the wall.

                says the Lord, and cry they have sinned when they have not sinned before
                me, says the Lord, but have done that which was meet in mine eyes, and
                which I commanded them.
                </span><verse>17</verse><span>But those who cry
                transgression do it because they are the servants of sin, and are the

                severed from the ordinances of mine house.

    <block><span>
        And now, beloved brethren, we say unto you, that inasmuch as God has said
        that he
        would have a tried people, that he would purge them as gold, now we think
        that this time he has chosen his own crucible, wherein we have been tried;
        and we think if we get through with any degree of safety, and shall have
        kept the faith, that it will be a sign to this generation, altogether sufficient
        to leave them without excuse; and we think also, it will be a trial of
        our faith equal to that of Abraham, and that the ancients will not have
        whereof to boast over us in the day of judgment, as being called to pass
        through heavier afflictions; that we may hold an even weight in the balance
        with them; but now, after having suffered so great sacrifice and having
        passed through so great a season of sorrow, we trust that a ram may be
        caught in the thicket speedily, to relieve the sons and
        daughters of Abraham from their great anxiety, and to light up the lamp
        of salvation upon their countenances, that they may hold on now, after
        having gone so far unto everlasting life.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Now, brethren, concerning the places for the location of the saints, we
        cannot counsel you as we could if we were present with you; and as to the
        things that were written heretofore, we did not consider them anything
        very binding, therefore we now say once for all, that we think it most
        proper that the general affairs of the church, which are necessary to be
        considered, while your humble servant remains in bondage, should be transacted
        by a general conference of the most faithful and the most respectable of
        the authorities of the church, and a minute of those transactions may be
        kept, and forwarded from time to time, to your humble servant; and if there
        should be any corrections by the word of the Lord, they shall be freely
        transmitted, and your humble servant will approve all things
        whatsoever is acceptable unto God. If anything should have been suggested
        by us, or any names mentioned, except by commandment, or thus says the
        Lord, we do not consider it binding; therefore our hearts shall not be
        grieved if different arrangements should be entered into. Nevertheless
        we would suggest the propriety of being aware of an aspiring
        spirit, which spirit has oftentimes urged men forward to make foul speeches,
        and influence the church to reject milder counsels, and has eventually
        been the means of bringing much death and sorrow upon the church.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        We would say, beware of pride also; for well and truly has the wise man
        said, that pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a
        fall. And again, outward appearance is not always a criterion by which
        to judge our fellow man; but the lips betray the haughty
        and overbearing imaginations of the heart; by his words and his deeds
        let him be judged.
        Flattery is also a deadly poison. A frank and open rebuke provokes a good
        man to
        emulation; and in the hour of trouble he will be your best friend; but
        on the other hand, it will draw out all the corruptions of corrupt hearts,
        and lying and the poison of asps is
        under their tongues; and they do cause the pure in heart to be cast into
        prison, because they want them out of their way.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        A fanciful and flowery and heated imagination beware of; because the things
        of God are of deep import; and time, and experience, and careful and ponderous
        and solemn thoughts
        can only find them out. Thy mind, O man! if thou wilt lead a soul unto
        salvation, must stretch as high as the utmost Heavens, and search into
        and contemplate the lowest considerations of the darkest abyss, and expand
        upon the broad considerations of Eternal Expanse, he must commune with
        God. How much more dignified and noble are the
        thoughts of God, than the vain imaginations of the human heart! None but
        fools will trifle with the souls of men.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        How vain and trifling have been our spirits, our conferences, our councils,
        our private meetings, our private as well as public conversations—too low,
        too mean, too vulgar, too condescending for the dignified characters of
        the called and chosen of God, according to the purposes of His will, from
        before the foundation of the world! We are called to hold the keys of the
        mysteries of those things that have been kept hid from the foundation of
        the world until now. Some have tasted a little of these things, many of
        which are to be poured down from heaven upon the heads of babes; yea, upon
        the weak, obscure and
        despised ones of the earth. Therefore we beseech of you, brethren, that
        you bear with those who do not feel themselves more worthy than yourselves,
        while we exhort one another to a reformation with one and all, both old
        and young, teachers and taught, both high and low, rich and poor, bond
        and free, male and female; let honesty, and sobriety, and candor, and solemnity,
        and virtue, and pureness, and meekness, and simplicity crown our heads
        in every place; and in fine, become as little children, without malice,
        guile or hypocrisy.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        And now, Brethren, after your tribulations, if you do these things, and
        exercise fervent prayer and faith in the sight of God always,

        But I beg leave to say unto you, brethren, that ignorance, superstition
        and bigotry placing itself where it ought not, is oftentimes in the way
        of the prosperity of this church; like the torrent of rain from the mountains,
        that floods the most pure and crystal stream with
        mire, and dirt, and filthiness, and obscures everything that was clear
        before, and all rushes
        along in one general deluge; but time weathers tide; and notwithstanding
        we are rolled in the mire of the flood for the time being, the next surge
        peradventure, as time rolls on, may bring to us the fountain as clear as
        crystal, and as pure as snow; while the filthiness,
        flood-wood and rubbish is left and purged out by the way.

            its decreed course, or to turn it up stream, as to hinder the Almighty

        What is Boggs or his murderous party, but wimbling willows upon the shore
        to catch the flood-wood? As well might we argue that water is not water,
        because the mountain
        torrents send down mire and roil the crystal stream, although afterwards
        render it more pure than before; or that fire is not fire, because it is
        of a quenchable nature, by pouring on the flood; as to say that our cause
        is down because renegades, liars, priests, thieves and
        murderers, who are all alike tenacious of their crafts and creeds, have
        poured down, from their spiritual wickedness in high places, and from their
        strongholds of the devil, a flood of dirt and mire and filthiness and vomit
        upon our heads.

        No! God forbid. Hell may pour forth its rage like the burning lava of
        mount Vesuvius, or of Etna, or of the most terrible of the burning mountains;
        and yet shall Mormonism stand. Water, fire, truth and God are all realities.
        Truth is Mormonism. God is the author of it. He is our shield. It is by
        him we received our birth. It was by his voice that we were called to a
        dispensation of his gospel in the beginning of the fulness of times. It
        was by him we received the Book of Mormon;
        and it is by him that we remain unto this day; and by him we shall remain,
        if it shall be for our glory; and in his almighty name we are
        determined to endure tribulation as good soldiers unto the end.

        But brethren, we shall continue to offer further reflections in our next
        epistle. You will
        learn by the time you have read this, and if you do not learn it, you
        may learn it, that walls and irons, doors and creaking hinges, and half-scared-to-death
        guards and jailers, grinning like some damned spirits, lest an innocent
        man should make his escape to bring to light the damnable deeds of a murderous
        mob, are calculated in their very nature to make the soul of an honest
        man feel stronger than the powers of hell.
    </span></block>

        But we must bring our epistle to a close. We send our respects to fathers,
        mothers, wives and children, brothers and sisters; we hold them in the

        I send this epistle to Emma that she may have the first perusal of it.
        We feel to inquire after Elder Rigdon; if he has not forgotten us, it has
        not been signified to us by his writing. Brother George W. Robinson also;
        and Elder Cahoon, we remember him, but would like to jog his memory a little
        on the fable of the bear and the two friends who mutually
        agreed to stand by each other. And perhaps it would not be amiss to mention
        uncle John [Smith], and various others. A word of consolation and a blessing
        would not come amiss
        from anybody, while we are being so closely whispered by the bear. But
        we feel to excuse everybody and everything, yea the more readily when we
        contemplate that we are in the hands of persons worse than a bear, for
        the bear would not prey upon a dead carcass.

        Our respects and love and fellowship to all the virtuous Saints. We are
        your brethren and fellow-sufferers, and prisoners of Jesus Christ for the

        We continue to offer further reflections to Bishop Partridge, and to the
        church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, whom we love with a fervent
        love, and do always bear them in mind in all our prayers to the throne
        of God.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        It still seems to bear heavily on our minds that the church would do well
        to secure to themselves the contract of the land, which is proposed to
        them by Mr. Isaac Galland, and to cultivate the friendly feelings of that
        gentleman, inasmuch as he shall prove himself to be a man of honor and
        a friend to humanity; also Isaac Van Allen, Esq., the attorney- general
        of Iowa Territory, and Governor Lucas, that peradventure such men may be
        wrought upon by the providence of God, to do good unto his people. We
        really think that Mr. Galland's letter breathes that kind of a spirit,
        if we may judge correctly. Governor
        Lucas' also. We suggest the idea of praying fervently for all men
        who manifest any degree of sympathy for the suffering children of God.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        We think that the United States Surveyor of the Iowa Territory may be
        of great benefit to the church, if it be the will of God to this end; and
        righteousness should be manifested as the girdle of our loins.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        It seems to be deeply impressed upon our minds that the saints ought to
        lay hold of every door that shall seem to be opened unto them, to obtain
        foothold on the earth, and be making all the preparation that is within
        their power for the terrible storms that are now gathering in the heavens,
        "a day of clouds, with darkness and gloominess, and of thick
        darkness," as spoken of by the prophets which cannot be now of a
        long time lingering, for there seems to be a whispering that the angels
        of heaven who have been entrusted with the counsel of these matters for
        the last days, have taken counsel together; and among the rest of the general
        affairs that have to be transacted in their honorable council, they have
        taken cognizance of the testimony of those who were murdered at Haun's
        Mills, and also those who were martyred with D.W. Patten, and elsewhere,
        and have passed some decisions
        peradventure in favor of the saints, and those who were called to suffer
        without cause.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        These decisions will be made known in their time; and the council will
        take into consideration all those things that offend.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        We have a fervent desire that in your general conferences everything should
        be discussed with a great deal of care and propriety, lest you grieve the
        Holy Spirit, which shall be poured out at all times upon your heads, when
        you are exercised with those principles of righteousness that are agreeable
        to the mind of God, and are properly affected one toward another, and are
        careful by all means to remember, those who are in bondage, and in
        heaviness, and in deep affliction for your sakes. And if there are any
        among you who aspire after their own aggrandizement, and seek their own
        opulence, while their brethren are groaning in poverty, and are under sore
        trials and temptations, they cannot be
        benefited by the intercession of the Holy Spirit, which makes intercession
        for us day and night with groanings that cannot be uttered.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        We ought at all times to be very careful that such high-mindedness shall
        never have place in our hearts; but condescend to men of low estate, and
        with all long-suffering bear the infirmities of the weak.

        Now, brethren, I would suggest for the consideration of the conference,
        it being carefully and wisely understood by the council or conferences
        that our brethren scattered abroad,
        who understood the spirit of the gathering, that they fall into the places
        and refuge of safety that God shall open unto them, between Kirtland and
        Far West. Those from the
        east and from the west, and from far countries, let them fall in somewhere
        between those two boundaries, in the most safe and quiet places they can
        find; and let this be the present understanding, until God shall open a
        more effectual door for us for further
        considerations.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        And again, we further suggest for the considerations of the council, that
        there be no organization of large bodies upon common stock principles,
        in property, or of large companies of firms, until the Lord shall signify
        it in a proper manner, as it opens such a dreadful field for the avaricious,
        the indolent, and the corrupt hearted to prey upon the innocent and virtuous,
        and honest.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        We have reason to believe that many things were introduced among the saints
        before God had signified the times; and notwithstanding the principles
        and plans may have been good, yet aspiring men, or in other words, men
        who had not the substance of Godliness about them, perhaps undertook to
        handle edged tools. Children, you know, are fond of tools,
        while they are not yet able to use them.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Time and experience, however, are the only safe remedies against such
        evils. There are many teachers, but, perhaps, not many Fathers. There are
        times coming when God will signify many things which are expedient for
        the well-being of the Saints; but the times have not yet come, but will
        come, as fast as there can be found place and reception for them.

                his mighty arm.

                <verse>7</verse><span>It is an imperative duty that we owe to God, to angels, with whom we shall
                be brought to stand, and also to ourselves, to our wives and children,
                who have been made to bow down with grief, sorrow, and care, under the
                most damning hand of murder, tyranny, and oppression, supported and urged
                on and upheld by the influence of that spirit which has so strongly riveted
                the creeds of the fathers, who have inherited lies, upon the hearts of
                the children, and filled the world with confusion, and has been growing stronger
                and stronger, and is now the very mainspring of all corruption, and the
                whole earth groans under the
                weight of its iniquity.

                have been murdered under
                its iron hand;

                </span><verse>12</verse><span>for there are many yet on the earth among all sects, parties, and
                denominations, who are blinded by the subtle craftiness of men, whereby
                they lie in wait to deceive, and who are only kept from the truth because
                they know not where to find it—

                </span><verse>15</verse><span>Let no man count them as small things; for there is much which lies in
                futurity, pertaining to the saints,

                <verse>16</verse><span>You know, brethren, that a very large ship is benefited very much by a
                very small helm in the time of a storm, by being kept workways with the
                wind and the waves.
                </span><verse>17</verse><span>Therefore, dearly beloved brethren, let us cheerfully do all things that
                lie in our power; and then may we stand still, with the utmost assurance,
                to see the salvation of God, and for his arm to be revealed.

        And again, I would further suggest the impropriety of the organization
        of bands or companies, by covenant or oaths, by penalties or secrecies;
        but let the time past of our
        experience and sufferings by the wickedness of Doctor Avard suffice and
        let our covenant be that of the everlasting covenant, as is contained in
        the Holy Writ and the things that God has revealed unto us. Pure friendship
        always becomes weakened the very moment you undertake to make it stronger
        by penal oaths and secrecy.

        Your humble servant or servants, intend from henceforth to disapprobate
        everything that is not in accordance with the fulness of the gospel of
        Jesus Christ, and is not of a bold, and frank, and upright nature. They
        will not hold their peace—as in times past when they see iniquity beginning
        to rear its head—for fear of traitors, or the consequences that shall
        follow by reproving those who creep in unawares, that they may get something
        with
        which to destroy the flock. We believe that the experience of the Saints
        in times past has been sufficient, that they will from henceforth be always
        ready to obey the truth without having men's persons in admiration
        because of advantage.

        It is expedient that we should be aware of such things; and we ought always
        to be aware of those prejudices which sometimes so strangely present themselves,
        and are so congenial to human nature, against our friends, neighbors, and
        brethren of the world, who choose to differ from us in opinion and in matters
        of faith. Our religion is between us and our God. Their religion is between
        them and their God.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        There is a love from God that should be exercised toward those of our
        faith, who walk uprightly, which is peculiar to itself, but it is without
        prejudice; it also gives scope to the
        mind, which enables us to conduct ourselves with greater liberality towards
        all that are not of our faith, than what they exercise towards one another.
        These principles approximate nearer to the mind of God, because it is like
        God, or Godlike.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        There is a principle also, which we are bound to be exercised with, that
        is, in common with all men, such as governments, and laws, and regulations
        in the civil concerns of life. This principle guarantees to all parties,
        sects, and denominations, and classes of religion, equal, coherent, and
        indefeasible rights; they are things that pertain to this life; therefore
        all are alike interested; they make our responsibilities one towards another
        in matters of corruptible things, while the former principles do not destroy
        the latter, but bind us
        stronger, and make our responsibilities not only one to another, but unto
        God also. Hence we say, that the Constitution of the United States is a
        glorious standard; it is founded in
        the wisdom of God. It is a heavenly banner; it is to all those who are
        privileged with the sweets of liberty, like the cooling shades and refreshing
        waters of a great rock in a thirsty and weary land. It is like a great
        tree under whose branches men from every clime can be shielded from the
        burning rays of an inclement sun.

        We, brethren, are deprived of the protection of its glorious principles,
        by the cruelty of the cruel, by those who only look for the time being,
        for pasturage like the beasts of the field, only to fill themselves; and
        forget that the Mormons, as well as the Presbyterians,
        and those of every other class and description, have equal rights to partake
        of the fruits of the great tree of our national liberty. But notwithstanding
        we see what we see, and feel what we feel, and know what we know, yet that
        fruit is no less precious and delicious to our taste; we cannot be weaned
        from the milk, neither can we be driven from the breast; neither will we
        deny our religion because of the hand of oppression; but we will hold on
        until death.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        We say that God is true; that the Constitution of the United States is
        true; that the Bible is true; that the Book of Mormon
        is true; that the Book Of Covenants
        is true; that Christ is true; that the ministering angels sent forth from
        God are true, and that we know that we have an house not made with hands,
        eternal in the heavens, whose builder and maker is God; a consolation which
        our oppressors cannot feel, when fortune, or fate, shall lay its iron hand
        on them as it has on us. Now, we ask, what is man? Remember, brethren,
        that time and chance happen to all men.

        We shall continue our reflections in our next. We subscribe ourselves,
        your sincere friends and brethren in the bonds of the everlasting Gospel,
        prisoners of Jesus Christ, for the sake of the Gospel and the Saints. We
        pronounce the blessings of heaven upon the heads of the Saints who seek
        to serve God with undivided hearts, in the name of Jesus Christ,</span><break></break><span>Amen.
