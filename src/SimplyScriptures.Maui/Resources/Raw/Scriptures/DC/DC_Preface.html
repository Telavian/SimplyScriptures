        Dear Brethren:
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        We deem it to be unnecessary to entertain you with a lengthy preface to
        the following volume, but merely to say, that it contains in short, the
        leading items of the religion which we have professed to believe.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        The first part of the book will be found to contain a series of Lectures
        as delivered before a Theological class in this place, and in consequence
        of their embracing the important
        doctrine of salvation, we have arranged them into the following work.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        The second part contains items or principles for the regulation of the
        church, as taken
        from the revelations which have been given since its organization, as
        well as from former ones.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        There may be an aversion in the minds of some against receiving any thing
        purporting to be articles of religious faith, in consequence of there being
        so many now extant; but if men believe a system, and profess that it was
        given by inspiration, certainly, the more
        intelligibly they can present it, the better. It does not make a principle
        untrue to print it, neither does it make it true not to print it.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        The church viewing this subject to be of importance, appointed, through
        their servants and delegates the High Council, your servants to select
        and compile this work. Several reasons might be adduced in favor of this
        move of the Council, but we only add a few
        words. They knew that the church was evil spoken of in many placesâ€”its
        faith and belief misrepresented, and the way of truth thus subverted. By
        some it was represented as disbelieving the Bible,
        by others as being an enemy to all good order and uprightness, and by
        others as being injurious to the peace of all governments civil and political.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        We have, therefore, endeavored to present, though in few words, our belief,
        and when we say this, humbly trust, the faith and principles of this society
        as a body.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        We do not present this little volume with any other expectation than that
        we are to be
        called to answer to every principle advanced, in that day when the secrets
        of all hearts will be revealed, and the reward of every man's labor
        be given him.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        With sentiments of esteem and sincere respect, we subscribe ourselves
        your brethren in the bonds of the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.
    </span></block>
