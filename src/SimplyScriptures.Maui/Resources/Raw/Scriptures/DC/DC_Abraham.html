        Abraham seeks for the right belonging to the fathers

        <note><span>Abraham 1:1–2:18 is recorded in a manuscript dated November 1835</span></note>
        <verse>1</verse><span>In the land of the Chaldeans, at the residence of my fathers, I, Abraham,
        saw that it was
        needful for me to obtain another place of residence;
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>and, finding there was greater happiness and peace and rest for me, I
        sought for the blessings of the fathers, and the right whereunto I should
        be ordained to administer the same; having been myself a follower of righteousness,
        desiring also to be one who possessed great knowledge, and to be a greater
        follower of righteousness, and to possess a greater knowledge, and to be
        a father of many nations, a prince of peace, and desiring to receive instructions,
        and to keep the
        commandments of God, I became a rightful heir, a High Priest, holding
        the right belonging to the fathers.
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>It was conferred upon me from the fathers; it came down from the fathers,
        from the beginning of time, yea, even from the beginning, or before the
        foundation of the earth, down to the present time, even the right of the
        firstborn, or the first man, who is Adam, or first father, through the
        fathers unto me.
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>I sought for mine appointment unto the Priesthood according to the appointment
        of God unto the fathers concerning the seed.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>5</verse><span>My fathers, having turned from their righteousness, and from the holy
        commandments which the Lord their God had given unto them, unto the worshiping
        of the gods of the heathen, utterly refused to hearken to my voice;
        </span><verse>6</verse><span>for their hearts were set to do evil, and were wholly turned to the god
        of Elkenah, and the god of Libnah, and the god of
        Mahmackrah, and the god of Korash, and the god of Pharaoh, king of Egypt;
        </span><verse>7</verse><span>therefore they turned their hearts to the sacrifice of the heathen in
        offering up their children unto these dumb idols, and hearkened not unto
        my voice, but endeavored to take away my life by the hand of the priest
        of Elkenah.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        The priest of Elkenah was also the priest of Pharaoh.
        </span><verse>8</verse><span>Now, at this time it was the custom of the priest of Pharaoh, the king
        of Egypt, to offer up upon the altar which was built in the land of Chaldea,
        for the offering unto these strange gods, men, women, and children.
        </span><verse>9</verse><span>And it came to pass that the priest made an offering unto the god of Pharaoh,
        and also
        unto the god of Shagreel, even after the manner of the Egyptians. Now
        the god of
        Shagreel was the sun.
        </span><verse>10</verse><span>Even the thank-offering of a child did the priest of Pharaoh offer upon
        the altar which stood by the hill called Potiphar’s Hill, at the head of
        the plain of Olishem.
        </span><verse>11</verse><span>Now, this priest had offered upon this altar three virgins at one time,
        who were the daughters of Onitah, one of the royal descent directly from the
        loins of Ham. These virgins were offered up because of their virtue; they
        would not bow down to worship gods of wood or of stone, therefore they
        were killed upon this altar, and it was done after the manner of the Egyptians.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>12</verse><span>And it came to pass that the priests laid violence upon me, that they
        might slay me also, as they did those virgins upon this altar. And that
        you may have a knowledge of this altar, I will refer you to the representation
        at the commencement of this record.
        </span><verse>13</verse><span>It was made after the form of a bedstead, such as was had among the Chaldeans,
        and it stood before the gods of Elkenah, Libnah, Mahmackrah, Korash, and
        also a god like unto that of Pharaoh, king of Egypt.
        </span><verse>14</verse><span>That you may have an understanding of these gods, I have given you the
        fashion of them in the figures at the beginning, which manner of figures
        is called by the Chaldeans Rahleenos, which signifies hieroglyphics.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>15</verse><span>And as they lifted up their hands upon me, that they might offer me up
        and take away my life, behold, I lifted up my voice unto the Lord my God,
        and the Lord hearkened and
        heard, and he filled me with the vision of the Almighty, and the angel
        of his presence stood by me, and immediately unloosed my bands;
        </span><verse>16</verse><span>and his voice was unto me:
        </span><quote>
            <block><span>
                Abraham, Abraham, behold, my name is Jehovah, and I have heard thee, and
                have come down to deliver thee, and to take thee away from thy father’s
                house, and from all thy kinsfolk, into a strange land which thou knowest
                not of;
                </span><verse>17</verse><span>and this because they have turned their hearts away from me, to worship
                the god of Elkenah, and the god of Libnah, and the god of Mahmackrah, and
                the god of Korash, and the god of
                Pharaoh, king of Egypt; therefore I have come down to visit them, and
                to destroy him who hath lifted up his hand against thee, Abraham, my son,
                to take away thy life.
            </span></block>

            <block>
                <verse>18</verse><span>Behold, I will lead thee by my hand, and I will take thee, to put upon
                thee my name, even the Priesthood of thy father, and my power shall be
                over thee.
                </span><verse>19</verse><span>As it was with Noah so shall it be with thee; but through thy ministry
                my name shall be known in the earth forever, for I am thy God.

        <verse>20</verse><span>Behold, Potiphar’s Hill was in the land of Ur, of Chaldea. And the Lord
        broke down the altar of Elkenah, and of the gods of the land, and utterly
        destroyed them, and smote the priest that he died; and there was great
        mourning in Chaldea, and also in the court of
        Pharaoh; which Pharaoh signifies king by royal blood.

                Origin of Egypt
            </span></heading>

            <block>
                <verse>21</verse><span>Now this king of Egypt was a descendant from the loins of Ham, and was
                a partaker of the blood of the Canaanites by birth.
                </span><verse>22</verse><span>From this descent sprang all the Egyptians, and thus the blood of the
                Canaanites was preserved in the land.
                </span><verse>23</verse><span>The land of Egypt being first
                discovered by a woman, who was the daughter of Ham, and the daughter of
                Egyptus, which in the Chaldean signifies Egypt, which signifies that which
                is forbidden;
                </span><verse>24</verse><span>when this woman discovered the land it was under water, who afterward
                settled her sons in it; and thus, from Ham, sprang that race which preserved
                the curse in the land.
            </span></block>

            <block>
                <verse>25</verse><span>Now the first government of Egypt was established by Pharaoh, the eldest
                son of Egyptus, the daughter of Ham, and it was after the manner of the government
                of Ham, which was patriarchal.
                </span><verse>26</verse><span>Pharaoh, being a righteous man, established his kingdom and judged his
                people wisely and justly all his days, seeking earnestly to imitate that
                order
                established by the fathers in the first generations, in the days of the
                first patriarchal reign, even in the reign of Adam, and also of Noah, his
                father, who blessed him with the
                blessings of the earth, and with the blessings of wisdom, but cursed him
                as pertaining to the Priesthood.
                </span><verse>27</verse><span>Now, Pharaoh being of that lineage by which he could not have the
                right of Priesthood, notwithstanding the Pharaohs would fain claim it
                from Noah, through Ham, therefore my father was led away by their idolatry;
                </span><verse>28</verse><span>but I shall endeavor, hereafter, to delineate the chronology running back
                from myself to the beginning of the creation, for the records have come
                into my hands, which I hold unto this present time.

        Leaving Ur
    </span></heading>

    <block>
        <verse>29</verse><span>Now, after the priest of Elkenah was smitten that he died, there came
        a fulfilment of those things which were said unto me concerning the land
        of Chaldea, that there should be a famine in the land.
        </span><verse>30</verse><span>Accordingly a famine prevailed throughout all the land of Chaldea, and
        my father was sorely tormented because of the famine, and he repented of
        the evil which he had determined against me, to take away my life.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>31</verse><span>But the records of the fathers, even the patriarchs, concerning the right
        of Priesthood, the Lord my God preserved in mine own hands; therefore a
        knowledge of the beginning of the creation, and also of the planets, and
        of the stars, as they were made known unto the
        fathers, have I kept even unto this day, and I shall endeavor to write
        some of these things upon this record, for the benefit of my posterity
        that shall come after me.

        <verse>1</verse><span>Now the Lord God caused the famine to wax sore in the land of Ur, insomuch
        that Haran, my brother, died; but Terah, my father, yet lived in the land
        of Ur, of the Chaldees.
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>And it came to pass that I, Abraham, took Sarai to wife, and Nahor, my
        brother, took Milcah to wife, who was the daughter of Haran.
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>Now the Lord had said unto me:
        </span><quote><span>
            Abraham, get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy
            father’s house, unto a land that I will show thee.

        <verse>4</verse><span>Therefore I left the land of Ur, of the Chaldees, to go into the land
        of Canaan; and I took Lot, my brother’s son, and his wife, and Sarai my
        wife; and also my father followed after me, unto the land which we denominated
        Haran.

                Arise, and take Lot with thee; for I have purposed to take thee away out
                of Haran, and to make of thee a minister to bear my name in a strange land
                which I will give
                unto thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession, when they hearken
                to my voice.

            <block>
                <verse>7</verse><span>For I am the Lord thy God; I dwell in heaven; the earth is my footstool;

                and the fire to be my
                chariot; I say to the mountains, “Depart hence,” and behold, they are
                taken away by a whirlwind, in an instant, suddenly.

            is in order because it standeth above the earth upon which thou standest,
