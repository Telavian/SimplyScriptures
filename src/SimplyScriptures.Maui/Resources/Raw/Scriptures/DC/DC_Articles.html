        doing good to all men; indeed, we may say that we follow the admonition
        of Paul—We believe all things, we hope all things, we have endured many
        things, and hope to be able to endure all things. If there is anything
        virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these
        things.
