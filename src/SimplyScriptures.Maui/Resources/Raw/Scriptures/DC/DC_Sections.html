                faith. This church being organized according to the will of him who rules all things on the sixth day of

        <verse>1</verse><span>Hearken, O ye people of my church, saith the voice of him who dwells on
        high, and whose eyes are upon all men; yea, verily I say: Hearken ye people
        from afar; and ye that
        are upon the islands of the sea, listen together.
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>For verily the voice of the Lord is unto all men, and there is none to
        escape; and there is no eye that shall not see, neither ear that shall
        not hear, neither heart that shall not be penetrated.
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>And the rebellious shall be
        pierced with much sorrow; for their iniquities shall be spoken upon the
        housetops, and their secret acts shall be revealed.
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>And the voice of warning shall be unto all people, by the mouths of my
        disciples, whom I have chosen in these last days.
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>And they shall go forth and none shall stay them, for I the Lord have
        commanded them.

        <verse>6</verse><span>Behold, this is mine authority, and the authority of my servants, and
        my preface unto the book of my commandments, which I have given them to
        publish unto you, O inhabitants of the earth.
        </span><verse>7</verse><span>Wherefore, fear and tremble, O ye people, for what I the Lord have decreed
        in them shall be fulfilled.
        </span><verse>8</verse><span>And verily I say unto you, that they who go forth, bearing these tidings
        unto the inhabitants of the earth, to them is power given to seal both
        on earth and in heaven, the unbelieving and rebellious;
        </span><verse>9</verse><span>yea, verily, to seal them up unto the day when the wrath of God shall
        be poured out upon the wicked without measure—
        </span><verse>10</verse><span>unto the day when the Lord shall come to recompense unto every man according
        to his work, and measure to every man according to the measure which he
        has measured to his fellow man.

        <verse>11</verse><span>Wherefore the voice of the Lord is unto the ends of the earth, that all
        that will hear may hear:
        </span><verse>12</verse><span>Prepare ye, prepare ye for that which is to come, for the Lord is nigh;
        </span><verse>13</verse><span>and the anger of the Lord is kindled, and his sword is bathed in heaven,
        and it shall fall upon the inhabitants of the earth.
        </span><verse>14</verse><span>And the arm of the Lord shall be revealed; and the day cometh that they
        who will not hear the voice of the Lord, neither the voice of his servants,
        neither give heed to the words of the prophets and apostles, shall be cut
        off from among the
        people;
        </span><verse>15</verse><span>for they have strayed from mine ordinances, and have broken mine everlasting
        covenant;
        </span><verse>16</verse><span>they seek not the Lord to establish his righteousness, but every man walketh
        in his own way, and after the image of his own god, whose image is in the
        likeness of the world, and whose substance is that of an idol, which waxeth
        old and shall perish in
        Babylon, even Babylon the great, which shall fall.

        <verse>17</verse><span>Wherefore, I the Lord, knowing the calamity which should come upon the

        and spake unto him from heaven, and gave him commandments;
        </span><verse>18</verse><span>and also gave commandments to others, that they should proclaim these

        <verse>30</verse><span>And also those to whom these commandments were given, might have power
        to lay the foundation of this church, and to bring it forth out of obscurity
        and out of darkness, the only true and living church upon the face of the
        whole earth, with which I, the Lord, am well pleased, speaking unto the
        church collectively and not individually—
        </span><verse>31</verse><span>for I the Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance;
        </span><verse>32</verse><span>nevertheless, he that repents and does the commandments of the Lord shall
        be forgiven;
        </span><verse>33</verse><span>and he that repents not, from him shall be taken even the light which
        he has received; for my Spirit shall not always strive
        with man, saith the Lord of Hosts.

    <block>
        <verse>34</verse><span>And again, verily I say unto you, O inhabitants of the earth: I the Lord
        am willing to make these things known unto all flesh;
        </span><verse>35</verse><span>for I am no respecter of persons, and will that all men shall know that
        the day speedily cometh; the hour is not yet, but is nigh at hand,
        when peace shall be taken from the earth, and the devil shall have power
        over his own dominion.
        </span><verse>36</verse><span>And also the Lord shall have power over his saints, and shall reign in
        their midst, and shall come down in judgment upon Idumea, or the world.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>37</verse><span>Search these commandments, for they are true and faithful, and the prophecies
        and promises which are in them shall all be fulfilled.
        </span><verse>38</verse><span>What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, and I excuse not myself; and
        though the heavens and the earth pass away, my word shall not pass away,
        but shall all be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice or by the voice of
        my servants, it is the same.
        </span><verse>39</verse><span>For behold, and lo, the Lord is God, and the Spirit beareth record, and
        the record is true, and the truth abideth forever and ever.</span><break></break><span>Amen.

                Working in Harmony, Pennsylvania, from mid-April to mid-June 1828, Joseph Smith dictated and
                Martin Harris wrote what Joseph later called the Book of Lehi. Facing opposition from his wife, Martin
                pressed Joseph to ask the Lord through the Urim and Thummim whether Martin could take the
                translation to Palmyra to convince his friends and family. Joseph inquired of the Lord and the Lord said
                that Martin must not take the manuscript. Dissatisfied with the answer, Martin made a second
                request, resulting in a similar inquiry and answer. Martin persisted, and Joseph again asked, and
                permission was granted on certain conditions, which included showing them only to specified family
                members. Martin left for New York with the manuscript in mid-June. In early July, Joseph traveled to
                Palmyra to learn the cause of Martin’s absence and silence. Shortly after arriving, he learned that
                Martin had lost the manuscript. Joseph returned to Harmony in low spirits.

                HC: Immediately after my return home I was walking out a little distance, when behold the former
                heavenly messenger appeared and handed to me the Urim and Thummim again—for it had been taken
                from me in consequence of my having wearied the Lord in asking for the privilege of letting Martin
                Harris take the writings, which he lost by transgression—and I inquired of the Lord through it, and
                obtained the following:

                Shortly after receiving this revelation, Joseph Smith, Sr. returned to Palmyra where Oliver Cowdery was
                boarding at his house. Lucy Smith wrote that although Cowdery had questioned Joseph Sr. about the
                gold plates, he did not succeed in eliciting any information for a long time. This revelation likely motivated Joseph Sr. to share enough information with Oliver to prompt him to receive his own
                manifestation through prayer and travel to Harmony to meet Joseph.

                Joseph had not seen Martin since the summer of 1828 when Martin admitted to losing the 116 pages
                of manuscript. Opponents were threatening a lawsuit claiming Joseph did not have the gold plates and
                was defrauding believers. Martin desired of the Lord to know whether Joseph had in his possession,
                the record of the Nephites.

                Oliver Cowdery had previously boarded at Joseph Smith, Sr.’s house and heard about Joseph and the
                gold plates. Oliver prayed about these things and the Lord manifested to him that they were true.
                Oliver arrived in Harmony on April 7, 1829.

                HC: Two days after the arrival of Mr. Cowdery, I commenced to translate the
                Book of Mormon, and he
                began to write for me, which having continued for some time, I inquired of the Lord through the Urim
                and Thummim, and obtained the following:

        <verse>1</verse><span>A great and marvelous work is about to come forth unto the children of
        men.
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>Behold, I am God; give heed unto my word, which is quick and powerful,
        sharper than a two- edged sword, to the dividing asunder of both joints
        and marrow; therefore give heed unto my words.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>3</verse><span>Behold, the field is white already to harvest; therefore, whoso desireth
        to reap, let him
        thrust in his sickle with his might, and reap while the day lasts, that
        he may treasure up for his soul everlasting salvation in the kingdom of
        God.
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>Yea, whosoever will thrust in his
        sickle and reap, the same is called of God.
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>Therefore, if you will ask of me you shall receive; if you will knock
        it shall be opened unto you.

    <block>
        <verse>6</verse><span>Now, as you have asked, behold, I say unto you, keep my commandments,
        and seek to bring forth and establish the cause of Zion;
        </span><verse>7</verse><span>seek not for riches but for wisdom, and
        behold, the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto you, and then shall
        you be made rich. Behold, he that hath eternal life is rich.
        </span><verse>8</verse><span>Verily, verily, I say unto you, even as you desire of me so it shall be
        unto you; and if you desire, you shall be the means of doing much good
        in this generation.
        </span><verse>9</verse><span>Say nothing but repentance unto this generation; keep my commandments,
        and assist to bring forth my work, according to my commandments, and you
        shall be blessed.

        <verse>10</verse><span>Behold thou hast a gift, and blessed art thou because of thy gift. Remember
        it is sacred and cometh from above—
        </span><verse>11</verse><span>and if thou wilt inquire, thou shalt know mysteries which are great and
        marvelous; therefore thou shalt exercise thy gift, that thou mayest find
        out mysteries, that thou mayest bring many to the knowledge of the truth,
        yea, convince them of the error of their ways.
        </span><verse>12</verse><span>Make not thy gift known unto any save it be those who are of thy faith.
        Trifle not with sacred things.
        </span><verse>13</verse><span>If thou wilt do good, yea, and hold out faithful to the end, thou shalt
        be saved in the kingdom of God, which is the greatest of all the gifts
        of God; for there is no gift greater than the gift of salvation.

    <block>
        <verse>14</verse><span>Verily, verily, I say unto thee, blessed art thou for what thou hast done;
        for thou hast inquired of me, and behold, as often as thou hast inquired
        thou hast received instruction of
        my Spirit. If it had not been so, thou wouldst not have come to the place
        where thou art at this time.
        </span><verse>15</verse><span>Behold, thou knowest that thou hast inquired of me and I did enlighten
        thy mind; and now I tell thee these things that thou mayest know that thou
        hast been
        enlightened by the Spirit of truth;
        </span><verse>16</verse><span>yea, I tell thee, that thou mayest know that there is none else save God
        that knowest thy thoughts and the intents of thy heart.
        </span><verse>17</verse><span>I tell thee these things as a witness unto thee—that the words or the
        work which thou hast been writing are true.

    <block>
        <verse>18</verse><span>Therefore be diligent; stand by my servant Joseph, faithfully, in whatsoever
        difficult circumstances he may be for the word’s sake.
        </span><verse>19</verse><span>Admonish him in his faults, and also
        receive admonition of him. Be patient; be sober; be temperate; have patience,
        faith, hope and charity.
        </span><verse>20</verse><span>Behold, thou art Oliver, and I have spoken unto thee because of thy desires;
        therefore treasure up these words in thy heart. Be faithful and diligent
        in keeping the commandments of God, and I will encircle thee in the arms
        of my love.
        </span><verse>21</verse><span>Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God. I am the same that came unto
        mine own, and mine own
        received me not. I am the light which shineth in darkness, and the darkness
        comprehendeth it not.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>22</verse><span>Verily, verily, I say unto you, if you desire a further witness, cast
        your mind upon the night that you cried unto me in your heart, that you
        might know concerning the truth of these things.
        </span><verse>23</verse><span>Did I not speak peace to your mind concerning the matter? What greater
        witness can you have than from God?
        </span><verse>24</verse><span>And now, behold, you have received a witness; for if I have told you things
        which no man knoweth have you not received a witness?
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>25</verse><span>And, behold, I grant unto you a gift, if you desire of me, to translate,
        even as my servant Joseph.
        </span><verse>26</verse><span>Verily, verily, I say unto you, that there are records which contain much
        of my gospel, which have been kept back because of the wickedness of the
        people;
        </span><verse>27</verse><span>and now I command you, that if you have good desires—a desire to lay up
        treasures for yourself in heaven—then shall you assist in bringing to light,
        with your gift, those parts of my
        scriptures which have been hidden because of iniquity.
        </span><verse>28</verse><span>And now, behold, I give unto you, and also unto my servant Joseph, the
        keys of this gift, which shall bring to light this ministry; and in the
        mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>29</verse><span>Verily, verily, I say unto you, if they reject my words, and this part
        of my gospel and ministry, blessed are ye, for they can do no more unto
        you than unto me.
        </span><verse>30</verse><span>And even if they do unto you even as they have done unto me, blessed are
        ye, for you shall dwell with me in glory.
        </span><verse>31</verse><span>But if they reject not my words, which shall be established by the testimony
        which shall be given, blessed are they, and then shall ye have joy in the
        fruit of your labors.

    <block>
        <verse>32</verse><span>Verily, verily, I say unto you, as I said unto my disciples, where two
        or three are
        gathered together in my name, as touching one thing, behold, there will
        I be in the midst of them—even so am I in the midst of you.
        </span><verse>33</verse><span>Fear not to do good, my sons, for whatsoever ye sow, that shall ye also
        reap; therefore, if ye sow good ye shall also reap good for your reward.
        </span><verse>34</verse><span>Therefore, fear not, little flock; do good; let earth and hell combine
        against you, for if ye are built upon my rock, they cannot prevail.

        <verse>35</verse><span>Behold, I do not condemn you; go your ways and sin no more; perform with
        soberness the work which I have commanded you.
        </span><verse>36</verse><span>Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not.
        </span><verse>37</verse><span>Behold the wounds which pierced my side, and also the prints of the nails
        in my hands and feet; be faithful, keep my commandments, and ye shall inherit
        the kingdom of heaven.</span><break></break><span>Amen.

                HC: During the month of April I continued to translate, and he to write, with little cessation, during
                which time we received several revelations. A difference of opinion arising between us about the
                account of John the Apostle, mentioned in the New Testament, as to whether he died or continued to
                live, we mutually agreed to settle it by the Urim and Thummim and the following is the word which we

        <verse>1</verse><span>Behold, I say unto you, my son, that because you did not translate according
        to that
        which you desired of me, and did commence again to write for my servant,
        Joseph Smith, Jr., even so I would that ye should continue until you have
        finished this record, which I have entrusted unto him.
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>And then, behold, other records have I, that I will give unto you power
        that you may assist to translate.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>3</verse><span>Be patient, my son, for it is wisdom in me, and it is not expedient that
        you should translate at this present time.
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>Behold, the work which you are called to do is to write for my servant
        Joseph.
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>And, behold, it is because that you did not continue as you
        commenced, when you began to translate, that I have taken away this privilege
        from you.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>6</verse><span>Do not murmur, my son, for it is wisdom in me that I have dealt with you
        after this manner.
        </span><verse>7</verse><span>Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it
        unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me.
        </span><verse>8</verse><span>But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind;
        then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that
        your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is
        right.
        </span><verse>9</verse><span>But if it be not right you shall have no such feelings, but you shall
        have a stupor of thought that shall cause you to forget the thing which
        is wrong; therefore, you cannot write that which is sacred save it be given you from me.

    <block>
        <verse>10</verse><span>Now, if you had known this you could have translated; nevertheless, it
        is not expedient that you should translate now.
        </span><verse>11</verse><span>Behold, it was expedient when you commenced; but you feared, and the time
        is past, and it is not expedient now;
        </span><verse>12</verse><span>for, do you not behold that I have given unto my servant Joseph sufficient
        strength, whereby it is made up? And neither of you have I condemned.

        <verse>13</verse><span>Do this thing which I have commanded you, and you shall prosper. Be faithful,
        and yield to no temptation.
        </span><verse>14</verse><span>Stand fast in the work wherewith I have called you, and a hair of your
        head shall not be lost, and you shall be lifted up at the last day.</span><break></break><span>Amen.

                HC: After I had obtained the above revelation, both the plates and the Urim and Thummim were taken
                from me again; but in a few days they were returned to me, when I enquired of the Lord, and the Lord
                said thus unto me:

        <verse>10</verse><span>And, behold, Satan hath put it into their hearts to alter the words which
        you have caused to be written, or which you have translated, which have
        gone out of your hands.
        </span><verse>11</verse><span>And behold, I say unto you, that because they have altered the words,
        they read contrary from that which you translated and caused to be written;
        </span><verse>12</verse><span>and, on this wise, the devil has sought to lay a cunning plan, that he
        may destroy this work;
        </span><verse>13</verse><span>for he has put into their hearts to do this, that by lying they may say
        they have caught you in the words which you have pretended to translate.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>14</verse><span>Verily, I say unto you, that I will not suffer that Satan shall accomplish

        </span><dunder><span>to get thee</span></dunder><span>
        to tempt the Lord
        </span><dunder><span>thy God, in asking to translate it over again</span></dunder><span>.
        </span><verse>16</verse><dunder><span>And then,</span></dunder><span>
        behold, they say and think in their hearts:
        </span><quote><span>
            We will see if God has given him power to translate; if so, he will also
            give him power again;

            words, if he bringeth forth the same words, behold, we have the same with
            us, and we have altered them;
            </span><verse>18</verse><span>therefore they will not agree, and we will say that he has lied in his
            words, and that he has no gift, and that he has no power;
            </span><verse>19</verse><span>therefore we will destroy him, and also the work; and we will do this
            that we may not be ashamed in the end, and that we may get glory of the

    <block>
        <verse>20</verse><span>Verily, verily, I say unto you, that Satan has great hold upon their hearts;
        he stirreth them up to iniquity against that which is good;
        </span><verse>21</verse><dunder><span>
            and their hearts are corrupt, and full of
            wickedness and abominations; and they love darkness rather than light,
            because their deeds are evil; therefore they will not ask of me.
        </span></dunder>
        <verse>22</verse><dunder><span>Satan stirreth them up</span></dunder><span>,
        that he may lead their souls to destruction.
        </span><verse>23</verse><span>And thus he has laid a cunning plan,

        to destroy the work of God;
        </span><dunder><span>but I will require this at their hands, and it shall turn to their shame and condemnation in the day of judgment.</span></dunder>
        <verse>24</verse><span>Yea, he stirreth up their hearts to anger against
        this work.
        </span><verse>25</verse><span>Yea, he saith unto them, “Deceive and lie in wait to catch, that ye may
        destroy; behold, this is no harm.” And thus he flattereth them, and tells
        them that it is no sin to lie that they may catch a man in a lie, that
        they may destroy him.

    <block>
        <verse>26</verse><span>And thus he flattereth them, and leadeth them along until he draggeth
        their souls down to hell; and thus he causeth them to catch themselves
        in their own snare.
        </span><verse>27</verse><span>And thus he goeth up and down, to and fro in the earth, seeking to destroy
        the souls of men.
        </span><verse>28</verse><span>Verily, verily, I say unto you, wo be unto him that lieth to deceive because
        he supposeth that another lieth to deceive, for such are not exempt from
        the justice of God.
        </span><verse>29</verse><span>Now, behold, they have altered these words, because Satan says unto them,
        “He hath deceived you,” and thus he flattereth them away to do iniquity,

        <verse>38</verse><span>And now, verily I say unto you, that an account of those things that you
        have written, which have gone out of your hands, is engraven upon the plates
        of Nephi;
        </span><verse>39</verse><span>yea, and you remember it was said in those writings that a more particular
        account was given of these things upon the plates of Nephi.
        </span><verse>40</verse><span>And now, because the account which is engraven upon the plates of Nephi
        is more particular concerning the things which, in my wisdom, I would bring
        to the knowledge of the people in this account—
        </span><verse>41</verse><span>therefore, you shall
        translate the engravings which are on the plates of Nephi, down even till
        you come to the reign of king Benjamin, or until you come to that which
        you have translated, which you have retained;

        Nephi.
        </span><verse>45</verse><span>Behold, there are many things engraven upon the plates of Nephi which
        do throw greater views upon my gospel; therefore, it is wisdom in me that

        which my holy prophets, yea, and also my disciples, desired in their prayers
        should come forth unto this people.
        </span><verse>47</verse><span>And I said unto them, that it should be granted unto them
        according to their faith in their prayers;
        </span><verse>48</verse><span>yea, and this was their faith—that my gospel, which I gave unto them that
        they might preach in their days, might come unto their brethren the Lamanites,
        and also all that had become Lamanites because of their dissensions.
        </span><verse>49</verse><span>Now, this is not all—their faith in their prayers was that this gospel
        should be made known also, if it were possible that other nations should
        possess this land;
        </span><verse>50</verse><span>and thus they did leave a blessing upon this land in their prayers, that
        whosoever should believe in this gospel in this land might have eternal
        life;

                HC: Feeling it to be our duty, we commenced to reason out of the scriptures with our acquaintances
                and friends. About this time my brother Samuel H. Smith came to visit us. We informed him of what
                the Lord was about to do for the children of men, and began to reason with him out of the Bible. We
                also showed him that part of the work which we had translated, and labored to persuade him
                concerning the Gospel of Jesus Christ, which was now about to be revealed in its fulness. He was not, however, very easily persuaded of these things, but after much inquiry and explanation he retired to
                the woods, in order that by secret and fervent prayer he might obtain of a merciful God, wisdom to
                enable him to judge for himself. The result was that he obtained revelation for himself sufficient to
                convince him of the truth of our assertions to him; and on the twenty-fifth day of that same month in
                which we had been baptized and ordained, Oliver Cowdery baptized him; and he returned to his
                father’s house, greatly glorifying and praising God, being filled with the Holy Spirit.

                My brother Hyrum Smith came to us to inquire concerning these things, when at his earnest request, I
                inquired of the Lord through the Urim and Thummim, and received for him the following:

                HC: Joseph Knight, Sr., who, having heard of the manner in which we were occupying our time, very
                kindly and considerately brought us a quantity of provisions, in order that we might not be interrupted
                in the work of translation by the want of such necessities of life…he several times brought us supplies,
                a distance of at least thirty miles, which enabled us to continue the work when otherwise we must have relinquished it for a season. Being very anxious to know his duty as to this work, I inquired of the
                Lord for him, and obtained the following:

                into the woods to pray and inquire of the Lord respecting baptism for the remission of sins, that we
                found mentioned in the translation of the plates. While we were thus employed, praying and calling
                upon the Lord, a messenger from heaven descended in a cloud of light, and having laid his hands upon
                us, he ordained us, saying:

                HC: In the course of the work of translation, we ascertained that three special witnesses were to be
                provided by the Lord, to whom He would grant that they should see the plates from which this work
                should be translated and that these witnesses should bear record of the same…Almost immediately
                after we had made this discovery, it occurred to Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, and…Martin
                Harris…that they would have me inquire of the Lord to know if they might not obtain of his the
                privilege to be these three special witnesses and finally they became so very solicitous, and urged me
                so much to inquire that at length I complied; and through the Urim and Thummim, I obtained of the
                Lord for them the following:

                Oliver Cowdery arranged the Articles of the Church of Christ in June 1829. It was used by early believers
                to organize themselves according to the revealed word before THE
                Book of Mormon
                was published in

        Repent all ye ends of the earth and come unto me and be baptized in my
        name which is Jesus Christ and endure to the end and ye shall be saved.
        Behold Jesus Christ is the name which is given of the Father and there
        is none other name given whereby man can be saved. Therefore all men must
        take upon them the name which is given of the Father for
        in that name shall they be called at the last day. Therefore if they know
        not the name by which they are called they cannot have place in the kingdom
        of my Father.

    <block><span>
        Behold ye must walk uprightly before me and sin not and if ye do walk
        uprightly before me and sin not my grace is sufficient for you that ye
        shall be lifted up at the last day.
        Behold I am Jesus Christ the Son of the living God I am the same which
        came unto my own and my own received me not. I am the light which shines
        in darkness and the
        darkness comprehends it not. These words are not of men nor of man but
        of me. Now
        remember the words of him who is the first and the last the light and

                HC: We now became anxious to have that promise realized to us, which the angel that conferred upon
                us the Aaronic Priesthood had given us, viz., that provided we continued faithful, we should also have
                the Melchizedek Priesthood, which holds the authority of the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy
                Ghost. We had for some time made this matter a subject of humble prayer, and at length we got
                together in the chamber of Mr. Whitmer's house, in order more particularly to seek of the Lord what
                we now so earnestly desired; and here, to our unspeakable satisfaction, did we realize the truth of the
                Savior's promise—"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened
                unto you"—for we had not long been engaged in solemn and fervent prayer, when the word of the
                Lord came unto us in the chamber, commanding us that I should ordain Oliver Cowdery to be an Elder
                in the Church of Jesus Christ; and that he also should ordain me to the same office; and then to ordain
                others, as it should be made known unto us from time to time.
            </span></block>

            <block><span>
                We were, however, commanded to defer this our ordination until such times as it should be
                practicable to have our brethren, who had been and who should be baptized, assembled together,
                when we must have their sanction to our thus proceeding to ordain each other, and have them decide
                by vote whether they were willing to accept us as spiritual teachers or not; when also we were
                commanded to bless bread and break it with them, and to take wine, bless it, and drink it with them;
                afterward proceed to ordain each other according to commandment; then call out such men as the
                Spirit should dictate, and ordain them; and then attend to the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy
                Ghost, upon all those whom we had previously baptized, doing all things in the name of the Lord.
            </span></block>

            <block><span>
                The following commandment will further illustrate the nature of our calling to this Priesthood, as well
                as that of others who were yet to be sought after:

        to repent, and I speak

        suffered death in the flesh; wherefore he suffered the pain of all men,
        that all men might repent and come unto him.
        </span><verse>12</verse><span>And he hath risen again from the dead, that he might bring all men unto
        him, on conditions of repentance.
        </span><verse>13</verse><span>And how great is his joy in the soul that repents!
        </span><verse>14</verse><span>Wherefore, you are called to cry
        repentance unto this people.

        unto this people, and bring, save it be one soul unto me, how great shall

        you know not, yea, how hard to bear you know not.

        suffer even as I;

        both body and spirit—and would that I might not drink the bitter cup,

                was presented to the membership for approval. It was later published twice in The Evening and
                Morning Star, and place immediately after the preface in the 1835

                duties which now devolved upon us; and among many other things of the kind, we obtained by Him
                the following, by the spirit of prophecy and revelation which not only gave us much information, but
                also pointed out to us the precise day upon which, according to His will and commandment, we should
                proceed to organize His Church once more here upon the earth:

                HC: Having opened the meeting by solemn prayer to our Heavenly Father, we proceeded, according to
                previous commandment, to call on our brethren to know whether they accepted us as their teachers in
                the things of the Kingdom of God, and whether they were satisfied that we should proceed and be
                organized as a Church according to said commandment which we had received. To these several
                propositions they consented by a unanimous vote. I then laid my hands upon Oliver Cowdery, and
                ordained him an Elder of the "Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints;" after which, he ordained me
                also to the office of an Elder of said Church. We then took bread, blessed it, and brake it with them;
                also wine, blessed it, and drank it with them. We then laid our hands on each individual member of the
                Church present, that they might receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, and be confirmed members of the
                Church of Christ. The Holy Ghost was poured out upon us to a very great degree—some prophesied,
                whilst we all praised the Lord, and rejoiced exceedingly. Whilst yet together, I received the following
                commandment:

                and delicate situation, vouchsafed for us a supply of strength, and granted us “line upon line of

                HC: To our great grief, however, we soon found that Satan had been laying in wait to deceive, and
                seeking whom he might devour. Brother Hiram Page had in his possession a certain stone, by which he
                had obtained certain “revelations” concerning the upbuilding of Zion, the order of the Church, etc., all
                of which were entirely at variance with the order of God’s house, as laid down in the New Testament,
                as well as in our late revelations…Finding that many, especially the Whitmer family and Oliver
                Cowdery, were believing much in the things set forth by this stone, we thought best to inquire of the
                Lord concerning so important a matter and…we received the following:

                the time had come that the people of God should see eye to eye, and they seeing somewhat different
                upon the death of Adam (that is, his transgression), therefor they made it a subject of prayer and inquired of the Lord. And thus came the word of the Lord through Joseph the Seer.

        arm of mercy hath atoned for your sins;
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>who will gather his people even as a hen gathereth her chickens under

        therefore ye receive these things; but remember to sin no more, lest perils

        </span><verse>4</verse><span>Verily, I say unto you that ye are chosen out of the world to declare
        my gospel with the sound of rejoicing, as with the voice of a trump.
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>Lift up your hearts and be glad, for I am in your midst, and am your advocate

        elect hear my voice and harden not their hearts;
        </span><verse>8</verse><span>wherefore the decree hath gone forth from the Father that they shall be
        gathered in unto one place upon the face of this land, to prepare their
        hearts and be prepared in all things against the day when tribulation and
        desolation are sent forth upon the wicked.

        and all the proud and they that do wickedly shall be as stubble; and I
        will burn them up, saith the Lord of Hosts, that wickedness shall not be

    <block>
        <verse>10</verse><span>For the hour is nigh, and that which was spoken by mine apostles must
        be fulfilled; for as they spoke so shall it come to pass;
        </span><verse>11</verse><span>for I will reveal myself from heaven with power and great glory, with
        all the hosts thereof, and dwell in righteousness with men on earth a thousand
        years, and the wicked shall not stand.

        <verse>12</verse><span>And again, verily, verily, I say unto you, and it hath gone forth in a
        firm decree, by the will of the Father, that mine apostles, the twelve
        which were with me in my ministry at Jerusalem, shall stand at my right
        hand at the day of my coming in a pillar of fire, being clothed with robes
        of righteousness, with crowns upon their heads, in glory even as I am,
        to judge the whole house of Israel, even as many as have loved me and kept
        my commandments, and none else.
        </span><verse>13</verse><span>For a trump shall sound both long and loud, even as
        upon Mount Sinai, and all the earth shall quake, and they shall come forth—yea,
        even the dead which died in me, to receive a crown of righteousness, and
        to be clothed upon, even as I am, to be with me, that we may be one.

        <verse>14</verse><span>But, behold, I say unto you that before this great day shall come the

        </span><verse>16</verse><span>and there shall be a great hailstorm sent forth to destroy the crops of
        the earth.

        <verse>17</verse><span>And it shall come to pass, because of the wickedness of the world, that
        I will take
        vengeance upon the wicked, for they will not repent; for the cup of mine
        indignation is full; for behold, my blood shall not cleanse them if they

        </span><verse>19</verse><span>and their tongues shall be stayed that they shall not utter against me;
        and their
        flesh shall fall from off their bones, and their eyes from their sockets;
        </span><verse>20</verse><span>and it shall come to pass that the beasts of the forest and the fowls
        of the air shall devour them up.
        </span><verse>21</verse><span>And the great and abominable church, which is the whore of all the earth,
        shall be cast down by
        devouring fire, according as it is spoken by the mouth of Ezekiel the
        prophet, who spoke of these things, which have not come to pass but surely must, as I live,
        for abominations shall not reign.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>22</verse><span>And again, verily, verily, I say unto you that when the thousand years
        are ended, and men again begin to deny their God, then will I spare the
        earth but for a little season;
        </span><verse>23</verse><span>and the end shall come, and the heaven and the earth shall be consumed
        and pass away, and there shall be a new heaven and a new earth.
        </span><verse>24</verse><span>For all old things shall pass away, and all things shall become new, even
        the heaven and the earth, and all the fulness thereof, both men and beasts,
        the fowls of the air, and the fishes of the sea;
        </span><verse>25</verse><span>and not one hair, neither mote, shall be lost, for it is the workmanship
        of mine hand.

    <block>
        <verse>26</verse><span>But, behold, verily I say unto you, before the earth shall pass away,
        Michael, mine
        archangel, shall sound his trump, and then shall all the dead awake, for
        their graves shall be opened, and they shall come forth—yea, even all.
        </span><verse>27</verse><span>And the righteous shall be gathered on my right hand unto eternal life;
        and the wicked on my left hand will I be ashamed to own before the Father;
        </span><verse>28</verse><span>wherefore I will say unto them, “Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting
        fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.”
        </span><verse>29</verse><span>And now, behold, I say unto you, never at any time have I declared from
        mine own mouth that they should return, for where I am they cannot come,
        for they have no power.
        </span><verse>30</verse><span>But remember that all my
        judgments are not given unto men; and as the words have gone forth out
        of my mouth
        even so shall they be fulfilled, that the first shall be last, and that
        the last shall be first in all things whatsoever I have created by the
        word of my power, which is the power of my Spirit.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>31</verse><span>For by the power of my Spirit created I them; yea, all things both spiritual

        and
        again, first temporal, and secondly spiritual, which is the last of my
        work—
        </span><verse>33</verse><span>speaking unto you that you may naturally understand; but unto myself my
        works have no end, neither beginning; but it is given unto you that ye
        may understand, because ye have asked it of me and are agreed.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>34</verse><span>Wherefore, verily I say unto you that all things unto me are spiritual,
        and not at any time have I given unto you a law which was temporal; neither
        any man, nor the children of men; neither Adam, your father, whom I created.
        </span><verse>35</verse><span>Behold, I gave unto him that he should be an agent unto himself; and I
        gave unto him commandment, but no temporal commandment gave I unto him,
        for my commandments are spiritual; they are not natural nor temporal, neither
        carnal nor sensual.

        The fall of the devil

    <block>
        <verse>36</verse><span>And it came to pass that Adam, being tempted of the devil—for, behold,
        the devil was before Adam, for he rebelled against me, saying, “Give me
        thine honor, which is my power;” and also a third part of the hosts of
        heaven turned he away from me because of their agency;
        </span><verse>37</verse><span>and they were thrust down, and thus came the devil and his angels;
        </span><verse>38</verse><span>and,
        behold, there is a place prepared for them from the beginning, which place
        is hell.
        </span><verse>39</verse><span>And it must needs be that the devil should tempt the children of men,
        or they could not be agents unto themselves; for if they never should have
        bitter they could not know the sweet—
        </span><verse>40</verse><span>wherefore, it came to pass that the devil tempted Adam, and he partook
        of the forbidden fruit and transgressed the commandment, wherein he became
        subject to the will of the
        devil, because he yielded unto temptation.
        </span><verse>41</verse><span>Wherefore, I, the Lord God, caused that he should be cast out from the
        Garden of Eden, from my presence, because of his
        transgression, wherein he became spiritually dead, which is the first
        death, even that same death which is the last death, which is spiritual,
        which shall be pronounced upon the
        wicked when I shall say, “Depart, ye cursed.”

        his seed, that they should not die as to the temporal death, until I, the
        Lord God, should send forth angels to declare unto them repentance and
        redemption, through faith on the name of mine Only Begotten Son.

        <verse>43</verse><span>And thus did I, the Lord God, appoint unto man the days of his probation—that

                and after considerable investigation, Brother Page, as well as the whole Church who were present,
                renounced the said stone, and all things connected therewith, much to our mutual satisfaction and

                Thomas Marsh lived in Massachusetts and first learned of Joseph Smith during a visit to Palmyra in
                1829. He met with Martin Harris and Oliver Cowdery and returned home with the first sixteen printed
                pages of the
                Book of Mormon. After learning of the formal organization of the Church of Christ in April
                1830, Marsh moved to Palmyra in September.

                HC: At this time a great desire was manifested by several of the Elders respecting the remnants of the
                house of Joseph, the Lamanites, residing in the west—knowing that the purposes of God were great
                respecting that people, and hoping that the time had come when the promises of the Almighty in
                regard to them were about to be accomplished, and that they would receive the Gospel, and enjoy its blessings. The desire being so great, it was agreed that we should inquire of the Lord respecting the
                propriety of sending some Elders among them, which we accordingly did, and received the following:

                his brother, Parley P. Pratt, September 19th, about six weeks previous, came to inquire of the Lord what

                HC: Sidney Rigdon came to inquire of the Lord; and with him came Edward Partridge; the latter was a
                pattern of piety, and one of the Lord’s great men. Shortly after the arrival of these two brethren, thus
                spake the Lord:

                HC: The Lord greatly encouraged and strengthened the faith of His little flock, which had embraced the
                fulness of the everlasting Gospel, as revealed to them in the
                Book of Mormon, by giving some more
                extended information upon the Scriptures, a translation of which had already commenced. Much
                conjecture and conversations frequently occurred among the Saints, concerning the books mentioned,
                and referred to, in various places in the Old and New Testaments, which were now nowhere to be
                found. The common remark was, “They are lost books;” but it seems the Apostolic Church had some of
                these writings, as Jude mentions or quotes the Prophecy of Enoch, the seventh from Adam. To the joy
                of the little flock ... did the Lord reveal the following doings of olden times, from the prophecy of Enoch.

        <verse>2</verse><span>Now, in the days of the apostles the law of circumcision was had among
        all the Jews who believed not the gospel of Jesus Christ.
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>And it came to pass that there arose a great contention among the people
        concerning the law of circumcision, for the unbelieving husband was desirous
        that his children should be circumcised and become subject to the
        law of Moses, which law was fulfilled.
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>And it came to pass that the children, being brought up in subjection
        to the law of Moses, gave heed to the traditions of their fathers and believed
        not the gospel of Christ, wherein they became unholy.

    <block>
        <verse>5</verse><span>Wherefore, for this cause the apostle wrote unto the church, giving unto
        them a commandment, not of the Lord, but of himself, that a believer should
        not be united to an unbeliever; except the law of Moses should be done
        away among them,
        </span><verse>6</verse><span>that their
        children might remain without circumcision; and that the tradition might
        be done away, which saith that little children are unholy; for it was had
        among the Jews;
        </span><verse>7</verse><span>but little
        children are holy, being sanctified through the atonement of Jesus Christ;
        and this is what the scriptures mean.

        was made;

        and in mine own name, by the virtue of the blood which I have spilt,
        have I pleaded before the Father for them.

        until the judgment of the great day, which shall come at the end of the

        the veil of darkness shall soon be rent, and he that is not purified shall
        not abide the day.

        <verse>9</verse><span>Wherefore, gird up your loins and be prepared. Behold, the kingdom is

        with whom I am well pleased;

        I made, and all flesh is mine, and I am no respecter of persons.
        </span><verse>17</verse><span>And I have made the earth rich, and behold it is my footstool, wherefore,
        again I will stand upon it.
        </span><verse>18</verse><span>And I hold forth and deign to give unto you greater riches, even a land
        of promise, a land flowing with milk and honey, upon
        which there shall be no curse when the Lord cometh;

        ye shall possess it again in eternity, no more to pass away.
        </span><verse>21</verse><span>But, verily I say unto you that in time ye shall have no king nor ruler,
        for I will be your king and watch over you.
        </span><verse>22</verse><span>Wherefore, hear my voice and follow me, and you shall be a free people,
        and ye shall have no laws but my laws when I come, for I am your lawgiver,

        holiness before me.
        </span><verse>25</verse><span>And again I say unto you, let every man esteem his brother as himself.
        </span><verse>26</verse><span>For what man among you having twelve sons, and is no respecter of them,

        and sit thou there,” and looketh
        upon his sons and saith I am just?
        </span><verse>27</verse><span>Behold, this I have given unto you as a parable, and it is even as I am.
        I say unto you, be one; and if ye are not one ye are not mine.

    <block>
        <verse>28</verse><span>And again, I say unto you that the enemy in the secret chambers seeketh
        your lives.
        </span><verse>29</verse><span>Ye
        hear of wars in far countries, and you say

        there will soon be great wars in far
        countries, but ye know not the hearts of men in your own land.
        </span><verse>30</verse><span>I tell you these things because of your prayers; wherefore, treasure up
        wisdom in your bosoms, lest the
        wickedness of men reveal these things unto you by their wickedness, in
        a manner which shall speak in your ears with a voice louder than that which
        shall shake the earth; but if ye are prepared ye shall not fear.
        </span><verse>31</verse><span>And that ye might escape the power of the enemy, and be gathered unto
        me a righteous people, without spot and blameless—
        </span><verse>32</verse><span>wherefore, for this
        cause I gave unto you the commandment that ye should go to the Ohio; and
        there I will give unto you my law; and there you shall be endowed with
        power from on high;
        </span><verse>33</verse><span>and from thence, whosoever I will shall go forth among all nations, and
        it shall be told them what they shall do; for I have a great work laid
        up in store, for Israel shall be saved, and I will lead them whithersoever
        I will, and no power shall stay my hand.

    <block>
        <verse>34</verse><span>And now, I give unto the church in these parts a commandment, that certain
        men among them shall be appointed, and they shall be appointed by the voice
        of the church;
        </span><verse>35</verse><span>and they shall look to the poor and the needy, and administer to their
        relief that they shall not suffer; and send them forth to the place which
        I have commanded them;
        </span><verse>36</verse><span>and this shall be their work, to govern the affairs of the property of
        this church.

            <bc><span>are sent</span></bc><span>sent

        forth, all these things shall be gathered unto the bosom of the church.

                HC: Not long after this conference of the 2nd of January closed, there was a man came to me by the
                name of James Covel, who had been a Baptist minister for about forty years, and covenanted with the
                Lord that he would obey any command that the Lord would give him through me, as His servant, and I
                received the following:

        </span><verse>2</verse><span>the light and the life of the world; a light which shineth in
        darkness and the darkness comprehendeth it not;
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>the same which came in the meridian of time unto mine own, and mine own
        received me not;
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>but to as many as received me, gave I power to become my sons; and even
        so will I give unto as many as will receive me,
        power to become my sons.
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>And verily, verily, I say unto you, he that receiveth my gospel receiveth
        me; and he that receiveth not my gospel receiveth not me.
        </span><verse>6</verse><span>And this is my gospel—repentance and baptism by water, and then cometh
        the baptism of fire and the
        Holy Ghost, even the Comforter, which showeth all things, and teacheth
        the peaceable things of the kingdom.

        time; and, behold, I have bestowed great blessings upon thy head;
        </span><verse>9</verse><span>nevertheless, thou hast seen great sorrow, for thou hast rejected me many

            Arise and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on my name, and

        covenant which I have sent forth to recover my people, which are of the
        house of Israel.
        </span><verse>12</verse><span>And it shall come to pass that power shall rest upon thee; thou shalt
        have great faith, and I will be with thee and go before thy face.

        <verse>13</verse><span>Thou art called to labor in my vineyard, and to build up my church, and
        to bring forth Zion, that it may rejoice upon the hills and flourish.
        </span><verse>14</verse><span>Behold, verily, verily, I say unto thee, thou art not called to go into
        the eastern countries, but thou art called to go to the Ohio.
        </span><verse>15</verse><span>And inasmuch as my people shall assemble themselves at the Ohio, I have
        kept in store a blessing such as is not known among the children of men,
        and it shall be poured forth upon their heads. And from thence men shall
        go forth into all nations.

    <block>
        <verse>16</verse><span>Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, that the people in Ohio call upon
        me in much
        faith, thinking I will stay my hand in judgment upon the nations, but
        I cannot deny my word.
        </span><verse>17</verse><span>Wherefore lay to with your might and call faithful laborers into my vineyard,
        that it may be pruned for the last time.
        </span><verse>18</verse><span>And inasmuch as they do repent and receive the
        fulness of my gospel, and become sanctified, I will stay mine hand in

        God.”
        </span><verse>20</verse><span>Go forth
        baptizing with water, preparing the way before my face for the time of my coming;

        shall come.

        water, ye shall lay your hands, and they shall receive the gift of the
        Holy Ghost, and shall be looking forth for the signs of my coming, and
        shall know me.

                far as they knew it, though some strange notions and false spirits had crept in among them. With a
                little caution and some wisdom, I soon assisted the brethren and sisters to overcome them. The plan of

                embraced the everlasting Gospel, was readily abandoned for the more perfect law of the Lord; and the
                false spirits were easily discerned and rejected by the light of revelation. The Lord gave unto the
                Church the following:

                HC: A woman came making great pretensions of revealing commandments, laws, and other curious
                matters; and almost every person has advocates for both theory and practice in the various notions
                and projects of the age, it became necessary to inquire of the Lord, when I received the following:

        <verse>1</verse><span>O hearken, ye elders of my church, and give ear to the words which I shall
        speak unto you.
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>For behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, that ye have received a commandment
        for a law unto my church, through him whom I have appointed unto you to
        receive commandments and revelations from my hand.
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>And this ye shall know assuredly—that there is none other appointed unto
        you to receive commandments and revelations until he be taken, if he abide
        in me.
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>But verily, verily, I say unto you, that none else shall be appointed
        unto this gift except it be through him; for if it be taken from him he
        shall not have power except to appoint another in his stead.
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>And this shall be a law unto you, that ye receive not the teachings of
        any that shall come before you as revelations or
        commandments;
        </span><verse>6</verse><span>and this I give unto you that you may not be deceived, that you may know
        they are not of me.
        </span><verse>7</verse><span>For verily I say unto you, that he that is ordained of me shall come in
        at the gate and be ordained as I have told you before, to teach those revelations
        which you have received and shall receive through him whom I have appointed.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>8</verse><span>And now, behold, I give unto you a commandment, that when ye are assembled
        together ye shall

        how to act and

            direct my church, how
        </span></under><span>
        to act upon the points of my law and commandments, which I have given.
        </span><verse>9</verse><span>And thus
        </span><under>
            <bc><span>it shall become a law unto you, being / that</span></bc><span>
            ye shall become instructed in the law of my church, and be
        </span></under><span>
        sanctified by that which ye have received,
        </span><under><span>
            and
        </span></under><span>
        ye shall bind yourselves to act in all holiness before me—
        </span><verse>10</verse><span>that
        inasmuch as ye do this, glory shall be added to the kingdom which ye have
        received. Inasmuch as ye do it not, it shall be taken, even that which
        ye have received.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>11</verse><span>Purge ye out the iniquity which is among you; sanctify yourselves before me;
        </span><verse>12</verse><span>and if ye desire the glories of the kingdom, appoint ye my servant Joseph

            Smith, Jun.
        </span></dunder><span>
        , and uphold him before me by the prayer of faith.
        </span><verse>13</verse><span>And again, I say unto you, that if ye desire the mysteries of the kingdom,
        provide for him food and raiment, and whatsoever thing he needeth to accomplish
        the work wherewith I have commanded him;
        </span><verse>14</verse><span>and if ye do it not he shall remain unto them that have received him,
        that I may reserve unto myself a pure people before me.

        <verse>15</verse><span>Again I say, hearken ye elders of my church, whom I have appointed:

            Ye are not sent forth to be taught, but to teach the children of men the
            things which I have put into your hands by the power of my Spirit;

                that I have made unto your fathers,

                HC: The next day after the above was received, I also received the following revelation, relative to the
                gifts of the Holy Ghost:
            </span></block>

        <verse>1</verse><span>Hearken, O ye people of my church; for verily I say unto you that these
        things were spoken unto you for your profit and learning.
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>But notwithstanding those things which are written, it always has been
        given to the elders of my church from the beginning, and ever shall be,
        to conduct all meetings as they are directed and guided by the Holy Spirit.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>3</verse><span>Nevertheless ye are commanded never to cast any one out from your public
        meetings, which are held before the world.
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>Ye are also commanded not to cast anyone who belongeth to the church out
        of your sacrament meetings; nevertheless, if any have
        trespassed, let him not partake until he makes reconciliation.
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>And again I say unto you, ye shall not cast any out of your sacrament
        meetings who are earnestly seeking the kingdom—I speak this concerning
        those who are not of the church.
        </span><verse>6</verse><span>And again I say unto you, concerning your confirmation meetings, that
        if there be any that are not of the
        church, that are earnestly seeking after the kingdom, ye shall not cast
        them out.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>7</verse><span>But ye are commanded in all things to ask of God, who giveth liberally;
        and that which the Spirit testifies unto you even so I would that ye should
        do in all holiness of heart,
        walking uprightly before me, considering the end of your salvation, doing
        all things with prayer and thanksgiving, that ye may not be seduced by
        evil spirits, or doctrines of devils, or the commandments of men; for some
        are of men, and others of devils.

        <verse>8</verse><span>Wherefore, beware lest ye are deceived; and that ye may not be deceived
        seek ye
        earnestly the best gifts, always remembering for what they are given;
        </span><verse>9</verse><span>for verily I say unto you, they are given for the benefit of those who
        love me and keep all my commandments, and him that seeketh so to do; that
        all may be benefited that seek or that ask of me, that ask and not for
        a sign that they may consume it upon their lusts.
        </span><verse>10</verse><span>And again, verily I say unto you, I would that ye should always remember,
        and always retain in your minds what those gifts are, that are given unto
        the church.
        </span><verse>11</verse><span>For all have not every gift given unto them; for there are many gifts,
        and to every man is given a gift by the Spirit of God.
        </span><dot>
            <verse>12</verse><span>To some is given one, and to some is given another, that all may be profited

            <verse>14</verse><span>To others it is given to believe on their words, that they also might

        </span></dot>
        <dot>
            <verse>15</verse><span>And again, to some it is given by the Holy Ghost to know the differences
            of administration, as it will be pleasing unto the same Lord, according as
            the Lord will, suiting his mercies according to the conditions of the children
            of men.
        </span></dot>
        <dot>
            <verse>16</verse><span>And again, it is given by the Holy Ghost to some to know the diversities
            of operations, whether they be of God, that the manifestations of the Spirit
            may be given to every man to profit withal.
        </span></dot>
        <dot>
            <verse>17</verse><span>And again, verily I say unto you, to some is given, by the Spirit of God,
            the word of wisdom.
        </span></dot>
        <dot>
            <verse>18</verse><span>To another is given the word of knowledge, that all may be taught to be

        </span></dot>
        <dot>
            <verse>19</verse><span>And again, to some it is given to have faith to be healed;
        </span></dot>
        <dot>
            <verse>20</verse><span>and to others it is given to have faith to heal.
        </span></dot>
        <dot>
            <verse>21</verse><span>And again, to some is given the working of miracles;
        </span></dot>
        <dot>
            <verse>22</verse><span>and to others it is given to prophesy;
        </span></dot>
        <dot>
            <verse>23</verse><span>and to others the discerning of spirits.
        </span></dot>
        <dot>
            <verse>24</verse><span>And again, it is given to some to speak with tongues;
        </span></dot>
        <dot>
            <verse>25</verse><span>and to another is given the interpretation of tongues.

                HC: At about this time came Leman Copley, one of the sect called Shaking Quakers, and embraced the
                fulness of the everlasting Gospel, apparently honest-hearted, but still retaining the idea that the
                Shakers were right in some particulars of their faith. In order to have more perfect understanding on
                the subject, I inquired of the Lord, and received the following:

    </sectionheader><chapter style="display: none">1</chapter>
    <block>
        <verse>1</verse><span>Hearken unto my word, my servants Sidney, and Parley, and Leman; for behold,
        verily I say unto you, that I give unto you a commandment that you shall
        go and preach my gospel which ye have received, even as ye have received
        it, unto the Shakers.
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>Behold, I say unto you, that they desire to know the truth in part, but
        not all, for they are not right before me and must needs repent.
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>Wherefore, I send you, my servants Sidney and Parley, to preach the gospel
        unto them.
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>And my servant Leman shall be ordained unto this work, that he may reason
        with them, not according to that which he has received of them, but according
        to that which shall be taught him by you my servants; and by so doing I
        will
        bless him, otherwise he shall not prosper.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>5</verse><span>Thus saith the Lord; for I am God, and have sent mine Only Begotten Son
        into the world for the redemption of the world, and have decreed that he
        that receiveth him shall be
        saved, and he that receiveth him not shall be damned—
        </span><verse>6</verse><span>and they have done unto the Son of Man even as they listed; and he has
        taken his power on the right hand of his glory, and now reigneth in the
        heavens, and will reign till he descends on the earth to put all enemies
        under his feet, which time is nigh at hand—
        </span><verse>7</verse><span>I, the Lord God, have spoken it; but the hour and the day no man knoweth,
        neither the angels in heaven, nor shall they know until he comes.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>8</verse><span>Wherefore, I will that all men shall repent, for all are under sin, except
        those which I
        have reserved unto myself, holy men that ye know not of.
        </span><verse>9</verse><span>Wherefore, I say unto you that I have sent unto you mine everlasting covenant,
        even that which was from the beginning.
        </span><verse>10</verse><span>And that which I have promised I have so fulfilled, and the nations of
        the earth shall bow to it; and, if not of themselves, they shall come down,
        for that which is now exalted of itself shall be laid low of power.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>11</verse><span>Wherefore, I give unto you a commandment that ye go among this people,
        and say unto them, like unto mine apostle of old, whose name was Peter:
        </span><quote>
            <verse>12</verse><span>Believe on the name of the Lord Jesus, who was on the earth, and is to
            come, the beginning and the end;

            commandment, for the remission of sins;
            </span><verse>14</verse><span>and whoso doeth this shall
            receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, by the laying on of the hands of the
            elders of the church.
        </span></quote>

    <block>
        <verse>15</verse><span>And again, verily I say unto you, that whoso forbiddeth to marry is not
        ordained of God, for marriage is ordained of God unto man.
        </span><verse>16</verse><span>Wherefore, it is lawful that he should have one wife, and they twain shall
        be one flesh, and all this that the earth might answer the end of its creation;
        </span><verse>17</verse><span>and that it might be filled with the measure of man, according to his
        creation before the world was made.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>18</verse><span>And whoso forbiddeth to abstain from meats, that man should not eat the
        same, is not ordained of God;
        </span><verse>19</verse><span>for, behold, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air, and that
        which cometh of the earth, is ordained for the use of man for food and
        for raiment, and that he might have in abundance.
        </span><verse>20</verse><span>But it is not given that one man should possess that which is above another,
        wherefore the world lieth in sin.
        </span><verse>21</verse><span>And wo be unto man that sheddeth blood or that wasteth flesh and hath
        no need.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>22</verse><span>And again, verily I say unto you, that the Son of Man cometh not in the
        form of a woman, neither of a man traveling on the earth.
        </span><verse>23</verse><span>Wherefore, be not deceived, but continue in steadfastness, looking forth
        for the heavens to be shaken, and the earth to
        tremble and to reel to and fro as a drunken man, and for the valleys to
        be exalted, and for the mountains to be made low, and for the rough places
        to become smooth—and all this when the angel shall sound his trumpet.
        </span><verse>24</verse><span>But before the great day of the Lord shall come, Jacob shall flourish
        in the wilderness, and the Lamanites shall blossom as the rose.
        </span><verse>25</verse><span>Zion shall flourish upon the hills and rejoice upon the mountains, and
        shall be assembled together unto the place which I have appointed.

        you.
        </span><verse>27</verse><span>Behold, I will go before you and be your rearward; and I will be in your

                HC: In May, a number of Elders being present, and not understanding different spirits abroad in the

            </span></block>

        </sectioninfo>
    </sectionheader><chapter style="display: none">1</chapter>
    <block>
        <verse>1</verse><span>Hearken, O ye elders of my church, and give ear to the voice of the living
        God; and
        attend to the words of wisdom which shall be given unto you, according
        as ye have asked and are agreed as touching the church, and the spirits
        which have gone abroad in the earth.
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>Behold, verily I say unto you, that there are many spirits which are false
        spirits,
        which have gone forth in the earth, deceiving the world.
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>And also Satan hath sought to deceive you, that he might overthrow you.
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>Behold, I, the Lord, have looked upon you, and have seen abominations
        in the church that profess my name.
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>But blessed are they
        who are faithful and endure, whether in life or in death, for they shall
        inherit eternal life.
        </span><verse>6</verse><span>But wo unto them that are deceivers and hypocrites, for, thus saith the
        Lord, I will bring them to judgment.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>7</verse><span>Behold, verily I say unto you, there are hypocrites among you, who have
        deceived some, which has given the adversary power; but behold such shall
        be reclaimed;
        </span><verse>8</verse><span>but the
        hypocrites shall be detected and shall be cut off, either in life or in
        death, even as I will; and wo unto them who are cut off from my church,
        for the same are overcome of the world.
        </span><verse>9</verse><span>Wherefore, let every man beware lest he do that which is not in truth
        and righteousness before me.

    <heading><span>
        Receiving the Spirit of truth
    </span></heading>

    <block>
        <verse>10</verse><span>And now come, saith the Lord, by the Spirit, unto the elders of his church,
        and let us reason together, that ye may understand;
        </span><verse>11</verse><span>let us reason even as a man reasons one with another face to face.
        </span><verse>12</verse><span>Now, when a man reasons he is understood of man, because he
        reasons as a man; even so will I, the Lord, reason with you that you may
        understand.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>13</verse><span>Wherefore, I the Lord ask you this question—unto what were ye ordained?
        </span><verse>14</verse><span>To preach my gospel by the Spirit, even the Comforter which was sent forth
        to teach the truth.
        </span><verse>15</verse><span>And then received ye spirits which ye could not understand, and received
        them to be of God; and in this are ye justified?
        </span><verse>16</verse><span>Behold ye shall answer this question yourselves;
        nevertheless, I will be merciful unto you; he that is weak among you hereafter
        shall be made strong.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>17</verse><span>Verily I say unto you, he that is ordained of me and sent forth to preach
        the word of
        truth by the Comforter, in the Spirit of truth, doeth he preach it by
        the Spirit of truth or some other way?
        </span><verse>18</verse><span>And if it be by some other way it is not of God.
        </span><verse>19</verse><span>And again, he that
        receiveth the word of truth, doeth he receive it by the Spirit of truth
        or some other way?
        </span><verse>20</verse><span>If it be some other way it is not of God.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>21</verse><span>Therefore, why is it that ye cannot understand and know, that he that
        receiveth the word by the Spirit of truth receiveth it as it is preached
        by the Spirit of truth?
        </span><verse>22</verse><span>Wherefore, he that preacheth and he that receiveth, understand one another,
        and both are edified and rejoice together.
        </span><verse>23</verse><span>And that which doeth not edify is not of God, and is darkness.
        </span><verse>24</verse><span>That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth
        in
        God, receiveth more light; and that light grows brighter and brighter
        until the perfect day.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>25</verse><span>And again, verily I say unto you, and I say it that you may know the truth,
        that you may chase darkness from among you;
        </span><verse>26</verse><span>he that is ordained of God and sent forth, the same is appointed to be
        the greatest, notwithstanding he is the least and the servant of all.
        </span><verse>27</verse><span>Wherefore, he is possessor of all things; for all things are subject unto
        him, both in
        heaven and on the earth, the life and the light, the Spirit and the power,
        sent forth by the will of the Father through Jesus Christ, his Son.
        </span><verse>28</verse><span>But no man is possessor of all things
        except he be purified and cleansed from all sin.
        </span><verse>29</verse><span>And if ye are purified and cleansed from all sin, ye shall ask whatsoever
        you will in the name of Jesus and it shall be done.
        </span><verse>30</verse><span>But know this, it shall be given you what you shall ask; and as ye are
        appointed to the head, the spirits shall be subject unto you.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>31</verse><span>Wherefore, it shall come to pass, that if you behold a spirit manifested

                HC: Not long after the foregoing was received, the Saints from the State of New York began to come
                on, and it seemed necessary to settle them; therefore at the solicitation of Bishop Partridge, I inquired,
                and received the following:

        he receive directions
        how to organize this people.
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>For it must needs be that they be organized according to my laws; if otherwise,
        they will be cut off.

                Wherefore let my servant Edward receive the properties of this people which have
                covenanted with me to obey the law which I have given. And let my servant Edward
                receive the money as it shall be laid before him according to the covenant and go and
                obtain a deed or article of this land unto himself, for I have appoint him to receive these
                things. And thus through him the properties of this church shall be covenanted unto me.

            on that portion that is deeded unto him.

        unto this people, to take the money to provide food and raiment, according

        pay unto this church again according as they shall agree;

        </span><verse>14</verse><span>And let him also reserve unto himself for his own wants, and for the wants

                    of June, the Elders from the various parts of the country where they were
                    laboring, came in; and the conference before appointed, convened in Kirtland; and the
                    Lord displayed His power to the most perfect satisfaction of the Saints. The man of sin
                    was revealed, and the authority of the Melchizedek Priesthood was manifested and
                    conferred for the first time upon several of the Elders.

                    It was clearly evident that the Lord gave us power in proportion to the work to be done,
                    and strength according to the race set before us, and grace and help as our needs
                    required. Great harmony prevailed; several were ordained; faith was strengthened; and
                    humility, so necessary for the blessing of God to follow prayer, characterized the Saints.

                Conference was opened by prayer and exhortation by Joseph Smith Jr. the Revelator.
                After the business of the church was attended to according to the Covenants, The Lord
                made manifest to Joseph that it was necessary that such of the elders as were
                considered worthy, should be ordained to the high priesthood. The spirit of the Lord fell
                upon Joseph in an unusual manner…After he had prophesied, he laid his hands upon
                Lyman Wight to the High Priesthood after the holy order of God. And the Spirit fell upon
                Lyman and he prophesied concerning the coming of Christ.

                On the 4</span><superscript><span>th</span></superscript><span>
                of June 1831, a conference was held at Kirtland, represented by all the again
                saw the visible manifestations of the power of God as plain as could have been on the
                day of Pentecost and here for the first time I saw the Melchisedec priesthood introduced
                into the church of Jesus Christ as anciently; whereunto I was ordained under the hands
                of Joseph Smith, and I then ordained Joseph and Sidney and sixteen others such as he
                chose unto the same priesthood. The spirit of God was made manifest to the heeling of
                the sick, casting out devils, speaking in unknown tongues, discerning of spirits, and
                prophesying with mighty power, After the two days the conference broke up receiving
                the revelation which appointed 28 elders their Mission to Missouri.

                The Melchizedek priesthood was then for the first time introduced, and conferred on
                several of the elders. In this chiefly consisted the endowment—it being a new order— and bestowed authority. However, some doubting took place among the elders, and
                considerable conversation was held on the subject. The elders not fairly understanding
                the nature of the endowments, it took some time to reconcile all their feelings.

                Several were then selected by revelation, through President Smith, and ordained to the
                High Priesthood after the order of the Son of God; which is after the order of
                Melchizedek. This was the first occasion in which this priesthood had been revealed and
                conferred upon the Elders in this dispensation, although the office of an Elder is the
                same in a certain degree, but not in the fulness.

                did, and received the following:

        the same shall not be saved.

        of my people which are in Thompson, and their rebellions.
        </span><verse>7</verse><span>Wherefore, let my servant Newel

        “The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and my soul is not saved! “

        <verse>17</verse><span>Wo unto you poor men, whose hearts are not broken, whose spirits are not
        contrite, and whose bellies are not satisfied, and whose hands are not
        stayed from laying hold upon other men’s goods, whose eyes are full of
        greediness, and who will not labor with your own hands!

    <block>
        <verse>18</verse><span>But blessed are the poor who are pure in heart, whose hearts are broken,

        every man, and the poor shall rejoice;

                HC: Our reflections were many, coming as we had from a highly cultivated state of society in the east,
                and standing now upon the confines or western limits of the United States, and looking into the vast
                wilderness of those that sat in darkness; how natural it was to…exclaim in the language of the
                prophets, “When will the wilderness blossom as the rose? When will Zion be built up in her glory, and
                where will Thy temple stand, unto which all nations shall come in the last days?” Our anxiety was soon
                relieved by receiving the following:

        <verse>1</verse><span>Hearken, O ye elders of my church, saith the Lord your God, who have assembled
        yourselves together, according to my commandments, in this land, which
        is the land of Missouri, which is the land which I have appointed and consecrated
        for the gathering of the saints.
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>Wherefore, this is the land of promise, and the place for the city of
        Zion.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>3</verse><span>And thus saith the Lord your God, if you will receive wisdom here is wisdom.
        Behold, the place which is now called Independence is the center place;
        and a spot for the temple is lying westward, upon a lot which is not far
        from the courthouse.
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>Wherefore, it is wisdom that the land should be purchased by the saints,
        and also every tract lying westward, even unto the line running directly
        between Jew and Gentile;
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>and also every tract bordering by the prairies, inasmuch as my disciples
        are enabled to buy lands. Behold, this is wisdom, that they may obtain
        it for an everlasting inheritance.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>6</verse><span>And let my servant Sidney Gilbert stand in the office to which I have
        appointed him, to receive moneys, to be an agent unto the church, to buy
        land in all the regions round about, inasmuch as can be done in righteousness,
        and as wisdom shall direct.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>7</verse><span>And let my servant Edward Partridge stand in the office to which I have
        appointed him, and divide unto the saints their inheritance, even as I
        have commanded; and also those
        whom he has appointed to assist him.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>8</verse><span>And again, verily I say unto you, let my servant Sidney Gilbert plant
        himself in this place, and establish a store, that he may sell goods without
        fraud, that he may obtain money to buy lands for the good of the saints,
        and that he may obtain whatsoever things the
        disciples may need to plant them in their inheritance.
        </span><verse>9</verse><span>And also let my servant Sidney
        Gilbert obtain a license—behold here is wisdom, and whoso readeth let
        him understand— that he may send goods also unto the people, even by whom
        he will as clerks employed in his service;
        </span><verse>10</verse><span>and thus provide for my saints, that my gospel may be preached unto those
        who sit in darkness and in the region and shadow of death.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>11</verse><span>And again, verily I say unto you, let my servant William W. Phelps be
        planted in this place, and be established as a printer unto the church.
        </span><verse>12</verse><span>And lo, if the world receive his writings—behold here is wisdom—let him
        obtain whatsoever he can obtain in
        righteousness, for the good of the saints.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>13</verse><span>And let my servant Oliver Cowdery assist him, even as I have commanded,
        in
        whatsoever place I shall appoint unto him, to copy, and to correct, and
        select, that all things may be right before me, as it shall be proved by
        the Spirit through him.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>14</verse><span>And thus let those of whom I have spoken be planted in the land of Zion,
        as speedily as can be, with their families, to do those things even as
        I have spoken.
        </span><verse>15</verse><span>And now
        concerning the gathering—Let the bishop and the agent make preparations
        for those
        families which have been commanded to come to this land, as soon as possible,
        and plant them in their inheritance.
        </span><verse>16</verse><span>And unto the residue of both elders and members further

                HC: During this week the Colesville branch, referred to in the latter part of the last revelation [D&amp;C
                57:15], and Sidney Rigdon, Sidney Gilbert and wife, and Elders Morley and Booth, arrived. I received
                the following:
            </span></block>

    </sectionheader><chapter style="display: none">1</chapter>
    <block>
        <verse>1</verse><span>Hearken, O ye elders of my church, and give ear to my word, and learn
        of me what I will concerning you, and also concerning this land unto which
        I have sent you.
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>For verily I say unto you, blessed is he that keepeth my commandments,
        whether in life or in death; and he that is faithful in tribulation, the
        reward of the same is greater in the kingdom of
        heaven.
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>Ye cannot behold with your natural eyes, for the present time, the design
        of your God concerning those things which shall come hereafter, and the
        glory which shall follow after much tribulation.
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>For after much tribulation come the blessings. Wherefore the day cometh
        that ye shall be crowned with much glory; the hour is not yet, but is nigh
        at hand.
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>Remember this, which I tell you before, that you may lay it to heart,
        and receive that
        which is to follow.
        </span><verse>6</verse><span>Behold, verily I say unto you, for this cause I have sent you—
        </span><dot><span>
            that you might be obedient,
        </span></dot>
        <dot><span>
            and that your hearts might be prepared to bear testimony of the things
            which are to come;
        </span></dot>
        <dot>
            <verse>7</verse><span>and also that you might be honored in laying the foundation, and in bearing
            record of the land upon which the Zion of God shall stand;
        </span></dot>
        <dot>
            <verse>8</verse><span>and also that a feast of fat things might be prepared for the poor; yea,
            a feast of fat things, of wine on the lees well refined, that the earth
            may know that the mouths of the prophets shall not fail;
            </span><verse>9</verse><span>yea, a supper of the house of the Lord, well prepared, unto which all
            nations shall be invited.
            </span><verse>10</verse><span>First, the rich and the learned, the wise and the noble;
            </span><verse>11</verse><span>and after that cometh the day of my power; then shall the poor, the lame,
            and the blind, and the deaf, come in unto the marriage of the Lamb, and
            partake of the
            supper of the Lord, prepared for the great day to come.
            </span><verse>12</verse><span>Behold, I, the Lord, have spoken it.
        </span></dot>
        <dot>
            <verse>13</verse><span>And that the testimony might go forth from Zion, yea, from the mouth of
            the city of the heritage of God.
        </span></dot>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>14</verse><span>Yea, for this cause I have sent you hither, and have selected my servant
        Edward
        Partridge, and have appointed unto him his mission in this land.
        </span><verse>15</verse><span>But if he repent not of his sins, which are unbelief and blindness of
        heart, let him take heed lest he fall.
        </span><verse>16</verse><span>Behold his mission is given unto him, and it shall not be given again.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>17</verse><span>And whoso standeth in this mission is appointed to be a judge in Israel,
        like as it was in ancient days, to divide the lands of the heritage of
        God unto his children;
        </span><verse>18</verse><span>and to judge his people by the testimony of the just, and by the assistance
        of his counselors, according to the laws of the kingdom which are given
        by the prophets of God.
        </span><verse>19</verse><span>For verily I say unto you, my law shall be kept on this land.
        </span><verse>20</verse><span>Let no man think he is ruler; but let God rule him
        that judgeth, according to the counsel of his own will, or, in other words,
        him that counseleth or sitteth upon the judgment seat.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>21</verse><span>Let no man break the laws of the land, for he that keepeth the laws of
        God hath no need to break the laws of the land.
        </span><verse>22</verse><span>Wherefore, be subject to the powers that be, until he reigns whose right
        it is to reign, and subdues all enemies under his feet.
        </span><verse>23</verse><span>Behold, the laws which ye have received from my hand are the laws of the
        church, and in this light ye shall hold them forth. Behold, here is wisdom.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>24</verse><span>And now, as I spake concerning my servant Edward
        </span><dunder><span>
            Partridge
        </span></dunder><span>
        , this land is the land of his residence, and those whom he has appointed
        for his counselors; and also the land of the
        residence of him whom I have appointed to keep my storehouse;
        </span><verse>25</verse><span>wherefore, let them bring their families to this land, as they shall counsel
        between themselves and me.
        </span><verse>26</verse><span>For behold, it is not meet that I should command in all things; for he
        that is compelled in all things, the same is a slothful and not a wise
        servant; wherefore he receiveth no reward.
        </span><verse>27</verse><span>Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do
        many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness;
        </span><verse>28</verse><span>for the power is in them,
        wherein they are agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men do good they
        shall in nowise lose their reward.
        </span><verse>29</verse><span>But he that doeth not anything until he is commanded, and
        receiveth a commandment with doubtful heart, and keepeth it with slothfulness,
        the same is damned.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>30</verse><span>Who am I that made man, saith the Lord, that will hold him guiltless that
        obeys not my commandments?
        </span><verse>31</verse><span>Who am I, saith the Lord, that have promised and have not fulfilled?
        </span><verse>32</verse><span>I command and men obey not; I revoke and they receive not the blessing.
        </span><verse>33</verse><span>Then they say in their hearts, “This is not the work of the Lord, for
        his promises are not fulfilled.” But wo unto such, for their reward lurketh
        beneath, and not from above.

        Directions concerning the land of Zion
    </span></heading>

    <block>
        <verse>34</verse><span>And now I give unto you further directions concerning this land.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>35</verse><span>It is wisdom in me that my servant Martin Harris should be an example
        unto the church, in laying his moneys before the bishop of the church.
        </span><verse>36</verse><span>And also, this is a law unto every man that cometh unto this land to receive
        an inheritance; and he shall do with his moneys according as the law directs.
        </span><verse>37</verse><span>And it is wisdom also that there should be lands purchased in Independence,
        for the place of the storehouse, and also for the house of the printing.
        </span><verse>38</verse><span>And other directions concerning my servant Martin
        </span><dunder><span>
            Harris
        </span></dunder><span>
        shall be given him of the
        Spirit, that he may receive his inheritance as seemeth him good;
        </span><verse>39</verse><span>and let him repent of his sins, for he seeks the praise of the world.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>40</verse><span>And also let my servant William W. Phelps stand in the office to which
        I have appointed him, and receive his inheritance in the land;
        </span><verse>41</verse><span>and also he hath need to repent, for I, the Lord, am not
        </span><dunder><span>
            well
        </span></dunder><span>
        pleased with him, for he seeketh to excel, and he is not sufficiently
        meek before me.
        </span><verse>42</verse><span>Behold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I,
        the Lord, remember them no more.
        </span><verse>43</verse><span>By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins— behold, he will confess
        them and forsake them.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>44</verse><span>And now, verily, I say concerning the residue of the elders of my church,
        the time has not yet come, for many years, for them to receive their inheritance
        in this land, except they desire it through
        </span><dunder><span>
            the
        </span></dunder><span>
        prayer
        </span><dunder><span>
            of faith
        </span></dunder><span>
        , only as it shall be appointed unto them of the Lord.
        </span><verse>45</verse><span>For, behold, they shall push the people together from the ends of the
        earth.
        </span><verse>46</verse><span>Wherefore, assemble yourselves together; and they who are not appointed
        to stay in this land, let them preach the gospel in the regions round about;
        and after that let them return to their homes.
        </span><verse>47</verse><span>Let them preach by the way, and bear testimony of the truth in all places,
        and call upon the rich, the high and the low, and the poor to repent.
        </span><verse>48</verse><span>And let them build up churches, inasmuch as the inhabitants of the earth
        will repent.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>49</verse><span>And let there be an agent appointed by the voice of the church, unto the
        church in Ohio, to receive moneys to purchase lands in Zion.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>50</verse><span>And I give unto my servant Sidney Rigdon a commandment, that he shall
        write a
        description of the land of Zion, and a statement of the will of God, as
        it shall be made known by the Spirit unto him;
        </span><verse>51</verse><span>and an epistle and subscription, to be presented unto all the churches
        to obtain moneys, to be put into the hands of the bishop, of himself or
        the agent, as seemeth him good or as he shall direct, to purchase lands
        for an inheritance for the children of God.
        </span><verse>52</verse><span>For, behold, verily I say unto you, the Lord willeth that the
        disciples and the children of men should open their hearts, even to purchase
        this whole
        region of country, as soon as time will permit.
        </span><verse>53</verse><span>Behold, here is wisdom. Let them do this lest they receive none inheritance,
        save it be by the shedding of blood.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>54</verse><span>And again, inasmuch as there is land obtained, let there be workmen sent
        forth of all kinds unto this land, to labor for the saints of God.
        </span><verse>55</verse><span>Let all these things be done in order; and let the privileges of the lands
        be made known from time to time, by the bishop or the agent of the church.
        </span><verse>56</verse><span>And let the work of the gathering be not in haste, nor by flight; but
        let it be done as it shall be counseled by the elders of the church at
        the conferences,
        according to the knowledge which they receive from time to time.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>57</verse><span>And let my servant Sidney
        </span><dunder><span>
            Rigdon
        </span></dunder><span>
        consecrate and dedicate this land, and the spot for the temple, unto the
        Lord.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>58</verse><span>And let a conference meeting be called; and after that let my servants
        Sidney Rigdon and Joseph Smith, Jun., return, and also Oliver Cowdery with
        them, to accomplish the residue of the work which I have appointed unto
        them in their own land, and the residue as shall be ruled by the conferences.
        </span><verse>59</verse><span>And let no man return from this land except he bear record by the way,
        of that which he knows and most assuredly believes.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>60</verse><span>Let that which has been bestowed upon Ziba Peterson be taken from him;
        and let him stand as a member in the church, and labor with his own hands,
        with the brethren, until he is sufficiently chastened for all his sins;
        for he confesseth them not, and he thinketh to hide them.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>61</verse><span>Let the residue of the elders of this church, who are coming to this land,
        some of whom are exceedingly blessed even above measure, also hold a conference
        upon this land.
        </span><verse>62</verse><span>And

        I, Sidney, a servant of Jesus Christ by the will of God the Father and
        through the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ unto the Saints who are scattered
        abroad in the last days, may grace, mercy and peace, rest upon you from
        God the Father and from our Lord Jesus Christ,
        who is greatly to be feared, among his Saints and to be had in reverence
        of all them who obey him.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Beloved Brethren,
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        It has pleased God even the Father to make known unto us in these last
        days, the good
        pleasure of his will concerning his Saints; and to make known unto us,
        the things which he has decreed upon the nations even wasting and destruction.
        Until they are utterly
        destroyed, and the earth made desolate by reason of the wickedness of
        its inhabitants according as he has made known in times past by the prophets
        and apostles, that such calamities should befall the inhabitants of the
        earth in the last days, unless they should repent and turn to the living
        God. And as the time is now near at hand, for the
        accomplishment of his purposes and the fulfillment of his prophecies,
        which have been spoken by all the holy prophets ever since the world began,
        he has sent and signified, unto us by the mouths of his holy prophets,
        that he has raised up in these last days—the speedy accomplishment of his
        purposes which shall be accomplished, on the heads of the
        rebellious of this generation—among whom he has been pleased in much mercy
        and goodness to send forth the fullness of his gospel in order that they
        might repent and turn to the living God, and be made partakers of his Holy
        Spirit. But by reason of their
        wickedness and rebellion against him, and wicked and unbelieving hearts
        the Lord withdrew his spirit from them, and gives them up to work all uncleanliness
        with
        greediness, and to bring swift destruction on themselves--and through
        their wickedness to hasten the day of calamity, that they may be left without
        excuse in the day of vengeance.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        But it has pleased our Heavenly Father to make known some better things,
        concerning his Saints, and those who serve him in fear and rejoice in meekness
        before him, even things
        which pertain to life everlasting, for godliness has the promise of the
        life, that now is, and that which is to come; Even so it has pleased our
        Heavenly Father to make provisions for his Saints in these last days of
        tribulation that they through faith and patience, and by continuing in
        well-doing may preserve their lives; and attain unto rest and endless felicity-
        -but by no other means, than that of a strict observance of his commandments
        and
        teachings in all things as there is and can be no ruler or lawgiver in
        the kingdom of God save it be God our Savior himself—and before him he
        requires that all his saints and those who have named the name of Jesus,
        should be careful to depart from iniquity—and serve him with fear, rejoicing
        and trembling, least he be angry and they perish from their way.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        According to the prediction of the ancient prophets that the Lord would
        send his messengers in the last days, and gather his elect (which is the
        elect according to the covenant, viz., those who like Abraham are faithful
        to God and the word of his grace) from the four winds even from one end
        of the earth to the other as testified of by the
        Savior himself—so in these last days, he has commenced to gather together,
        into a place provided before of God and had in reserve in days of old being
        kept by the power and providence of God, for this purpose and which he
        now holds in his own hands, that they through faith, and patience may inherit
        the promises—a land which God by his own commandment has consecrated to
        himself where he has said that his laws shall be kept, and where his saints
        can dwell in safety, through their perseverance in well-doing, and their
        unfeigned repentance of all their sins, our Heavenly Father has provided
        this land himself because it was the one which was the best adapted for
        his children, where Jew and Gentile might dwell together: for God has the
        same respect to all those who call upon him
        in truth and righteousness whether they be Jew and Gentile; for there
        is no respect of person with him.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        This land being situated in the center of the continent on which we dwell
        with an exceeding fertile soil and ready cleared for the hand of the cultivator
        bespeaks the
        goodness of our God, in providing so goodly a heritage, and its climate
        suited for persons from every quarter of this continent, either East, West,
        North and South. Yea I think I may say, for all constitutions from any
        portion the world, and its productions nearly all
        varieties of both grain and vegetables which are common in this country,
        together with all means, clothing: in addition to this it abounds with
        fountains of pure water, the soil
        climate at surface are all adapted, to health indeed I may say that the
        whole properties of the country invite the Saints to come, and partake
        of their blessings, but what more need I say about a country which our
        Heavenly Father holds in his hands, for if it were unhealthy he could make
        it healthy and if barren he could make it fruitful. Such is the land which
        the Lord has provided for us, in the last days for an inheritance, and
        truly it is a goodly
        land, and none other as well suited for all the Saints as this and all
        those who have faith and confidence in God who has ever seen this land
        will bear the same testimony. In order that you may understand the will
        of God respecting this land and the way and means of possessing it, I can
        only refer you to commandments which the Lord has delivered by the mouth
        of his prophets which will be read, to you, by our brethren Oliver Cowdery
        and Newel K. Whitney whom the Lord has appointed, to visit the Churches
        and obtain means for purchasing this our inheritance that we may escape
        in the day of tribulation which is coming on the earth. I conclude by exhorting
        you to hear the voice of the Lord your God who is speaking to you in much
        mercy and who is sending forth, his word and his
        revelation in these last days, in order that we may escape impending vengeance;
        and the judgments which await this generation, and which will speedily
        overtake them—brethren pray for me, that I may be counted worthy to obtain
        an inheritance in the land of Zion and to overcome, the World through faith,
        and dwell with the sanctified, forever, and
        ever Amen.

                On the 2nd day of August 1831, Brother Sidney Rigdon stood up and asked saying: Do you receive this
                land for the land of your inheritance with thankful hearts from the Lord? Answer from all: We do.
            </span></block>

            <block><span>
                Do you pledge yourselves to keep the laws of God on this land, which you never have kept in your own
                lands? We do.
            </span></block>

            <block><span>
                Do you pledge yourselves to see that others of your brethren who shall come hither do keep the laws
                of God? We do.
            </span></block>

            <block><span>
                After prayer he arose and said: I now pronounce this land consecrated and dedicated to the Lord for a
                possession and inheritance for the Saints (in the name of Jesus Christ having authority from him.) And
                for all the faithful servants of the Lord to the remotest ages of time.</span><break></break><span>Amen.
            </span></block>

            <block><span>
                The day following, eight elders, viz., Joseph Smith, Jr., Oliver Cowdery, Sidney Rigdon, Peter Whitmer,
                Frederick G. Williams, William W. Phelps, Martin Harris, and Joseph Coe, assembled together where
                the temple is to be erected. Sidney Rigdon dedicated the ground where the city is to stand, and Joseph
                Smith, Jr., laid a stone at the northeast corner of the contemplated temple in the name of the Lord
                Jesus of Nazareth. After all present had rendered thanks to the great ruler of the universe, Sidney
                Rigdon pronounced this spot of ground wholly dedicated unto the Lord forever, Amen.

                William Phelps wrote in a July 1831 letter that Jackson County residents were “emigrants from
                Tennessee, Kentucky, Virginia, and the Carolinas, &amp;c., with customs, manners, modes of living and a
                climate entirely different from the northerners.” Joseph Smith later characterized many of the
                residents as “the basest of men” who “had fled from the face of civilized society, to the frontier
                country to escape the hand of justice, in their midnight revels, their sabbath breaking, horseracing, and
                gambling.” A traveler to western Missouri in 1833 made a similar observation, stating that “the only
                indications of its being Sunday” in the area was “the unusual gambling &amp; noise, &amp; assemblies around
                taverns.”

                HC: I left Independence for Kirtland. We started down the river in canoes…nothing important occurred
                until the third day, when many of the dangers so common upon the western waters manifested
                themselves; and after we had encamped upon the banks of the river…Brother Phelps, in open vision by
                daylight, saw the destroyer in his most horrible power, ride upon the face of the waters; others heard
                the noise, but saw not the vision. The next morning after prayer, I received the following:

        everlasting to everlasting, even Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the
        end.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>2</verse><span>Behold, verily thus saith the Lord unto you, O ye elders of my church,
        who are assembled upon this spot, whose sins are now forgiven you, for
        I, the Lord, forgive sins, and am merciful unto those who confess their
        sins with humble hearts;
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>but verily I say unto you, that it is not needful for this whole company
        of mine elders to be moving
        swiftly upon the waters, whilst the inhabitants on either side are perishing
        in unbelief.
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>Nevertheless, I suffered it that ye might bear record; behold, there are
        many dangers upon the waters, and more especially hereafter;
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>for I, the Lord, have decreed in mine anger many destructions upon the
        waters; yea, and especially upon these waters.
        </span><verse>6</verse><span>Nevertheless, all flesh is in mine hand, and he that is faithful among
        you shall not perish by the waters.

    <block>
        <verse>7</verse><span>Wherefore, it is expedient that my servant Sidney Gilbert and my servant
        William W.
        Phelps be in haste upon their errand and mission.
        </span><verse>8</verse><span>Nevertheless, I would not suffer that ye should part until you were chastened
        for all your sins, that you might be one, that you might not perish in
        wickedness;
        </span><verse>9</verse><span>but now, verily I say, it behooveth me that ye should part. Wherefore
        let my servants Sidney

            Gilbert
        </span></dunder><span>
        and William
        </span><dunder><span>
            W. Phelps
        </span></dunder><span>
        take their former company, and let them take their journey in haste that
        they may fill their mission, and through faith they shall overcome;
        </span><verse>10</verse><span>and inasmuch as they are faithful they shall be
        preserved, and I, the Lord, will be with them.
        </span><verse>11</verse><span>And let the residue take that which is needful for clothing.

            Gilbert

        take that which is not needful with him, as you shall agree.

        <verse>13</verse><span>And now, behold, for your good I gave unto you a commandment concerning
        these things; and I, the Lord, will reason with you as with men in days
        of old.
        </span><verse>14</verse><span>Behold, I, the Lord, in the beginning blessed the waters; but in the last
        days, by the mouth of my servant John, I cursed the waters.
        </span><verse>15</verse><span>Wherefore, the days will come that no flesh shall be safe upon the waters.
        </span><verse>16</verse><span>And it shall be said in days to come that none is able to go up to the
        land of Zion upon the waters, but he that is upright in heart.
        </span><verse>17</verse><span>And, as I, the Lord, in the beginning cursed the land, even so in the
        last days have I blessed it, in its time, for the use of my saints, that
        they may partake the fatness thereof.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>18</verse><span>And now I give unto you a commandment that what I say unto one I say unto
        all, that you shall forewarn your brethren concerning these waters, that
        they come not in
        journeying upon them, lest their faith fail and they are caught in snares;
        </span><verse>19</verse><span>I, the Lord, have decreed, and the destroyer rideth upon the face thereof,
        and I revoke not the decree.
        </span><verse>20</verse><span>I, the Lord, was angry with you yesterday, but today mine anger is turned
        away.
        </span><verse>21</verse><span>Wherefore, let those concerning whom I have spoken, that should take their
        journey in haste—again I say unto you, let them take their journey in haste.
        </span><verse>22</verse><span>And it mattereth not unto me, after a little, if it so be that they fill
        their mission, whether they go by water or
        by land; let this be as it is made known unto them according to their
        judgments hereafter.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>23</verse><span>And now, concerning my servants, Sidney Rigdon, Joseph
        </span><dunder><span>
            Smith, Jun.
        </span></dunder><span>
        , and Oliver Cowdery, let them come not again upon the waters, save it
        be upon the canal, while journeying unto their homes; or in other words
        they shall not come upon the waters to journey, save upon the canal.
        </span><verse>24</verse><span>Behold, I, the Lord, have appointed a way for the
        journeying of my saints; and behold, this is the way—that after they leave
        the canal they shall journey by land, inasmuch as they are commanded to
        journey and go up unto the
        land of Zion;
        </span><verse>25</verse><span>and they shall do like unto the children of Israel, pitching their tents
        by the way.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>26</verse><span>And, behold, this commandment you shall give unto all your brethren.
        </span><verse>27</verse><span>Nevertheless,
        unto whom is given power to command the waters, unto him it is given by
        the Spirit to know all his ways;
        </span><verse>28</verse><span>wherefore, let him do as the Spirit of the living God commandeth him,
        whether upon the land or upon the waters, as it remaineth with me to do
        hereafter.
        </span><verse>29</verse><span>And unto you is given the course for the saints, or the way for the saints
        of the camp of the Lord, to journey.

            Cowdery
        </span></dunder><span>
        , shall not open their mouths in the congregations of the wicked until
        they arrive at Cincinnati;
        </span><verse>31</verse><span>and in that place they shall lift up their voices unto God against that
        people, yea, unto him whose anger is kindled against their wickedness,
        a people who are well-nigh ripened for destruction.
        </span><verse>32</verse><span>And from thence let them journey for the
        congregations of their brethren, for their labors even now are wanted
        more abundantly among them than among the congregations of the wicked.

        <verse>33</verse><span>And now, concerning the residue, let them journey and declare the word
        among the congregations of the wicked, inasmuch as it is given;

        be spotless before me.
        </span><verse>35</verse><span>And let them journey together, or two by two, as seemeth them good, only

        be of good cheer, little children; for I am in your midst, and I have not
        forsaken you;
        </span><verse>37</verse><span>and inasmuch as you have humbled yourselves before me, the blessings of

                HC: In these infant days of the Church, there was a great anxiety to obtain the word of the Lord upon
                every subject that in any way concerned our salvation; and as the land of Zion was now the most
                important temporal object in view, I inquired of the Lord for further information upon the gathering of
                the Saints, and the purchase of the land, and other matters, and received the following:

        <verse>1</verse><span>Hearken, O ye people, and open your hearts and give ear from afar; and
        listen, you that call yourselves the people of the Lord, and hear the word
        of the Lord and his will
        concerning you.
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>Yea, verily, I say, hear the word of him whose anger is kindled against
        the wicked and rebellious;
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>who willeth to take even them whom he will take, and
        preserveth in life them whom he will preserve;
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>who buildeth up at his own will and
        pleasure; and destroyeth when he pleases, and is able to cast the soul
        down to hell.
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>Behold, I, the Lord, utter my voice, and it shall be obeyed.
        </span><verse>6</verse><span>Wherefore, verily I say, let the wicked take heed, and let the rebellious
        fear and tremble; and let the unbelieving hold their lips, for the day
        of wrath shall come upon them as a whirlwind, and all flesh shall know
        that I am God.

    <block>
        <verse>7</verse><span>And he that seeketh signs shall see signs, but not unto salvation.
        </span><verse>8</verse><span>Verily, I say unto you, there are those among you who seek signs, and
        there have been such even from the beginning;
        </span><verse>9</verse><span>but, behold, faith cometh not by signs, but signs follow those that believe.
        </span><verse>10</verse><span>Yea, signs come by faith, not by the will of men, nor as they please,
        but by the will of God.
        </span><verse>11</verse><span>Yea, signs come by faith, unto mighty works, for without faith no man
        pleaseth God; and with whom God is angry he is not well pleased; wherefore,
        unto such he showeth no signs, only in wrath unto their condemnation.
        </span><verse>12</verse><span>Wherefore, I, the Lord, am
        not pleased with those among you who have sought after signs and wonders
        for faith, and not for the good of men unto my glory.

        <verse>13</verse><span>Nevertheless, I give commandments, and many have turned away from my commandments
        and have not kept them.

        adulteresses; some of whom have turned away from you, and others remain

        as a snare, and their folly shall be made manifest, and their works shall
        follow them in the eyes of the people.
        </span><verse>16</verse><span>And verily I say unto you, as I have said before, he that looketh on a
        woman to lust after her, or if any shall commit adultery in their hearts,
        they shall not have the Spirit, but shall deny the faith and shall fear.
        </span><verse>17</verse><span>Wherefore, I, the Lord, have said that the fearful, and the unbelieving,

        </span><verse>21</verse><span>when the earth shall be transfigured, even according to the pattern which
        was shown unto mine apostles upon the mount; of which account the fulness
        ye have not yet received.

        <verse>22</verse><span>And now, verily I say unto you, that as I said that I would make known
        my will unto you, behold I will make it known unto you, not by the way
        of commandment, for there are many who observe not to keep my commandments.
        </span><verse>23</verse><span>But unto him that keepeth my commandments I will give the mysteries of
        my kingdom, and the same shall be in him a well of living water, springing
        up unto everlasting life.

        <verse>24</verse><span>And now, behold, this is the will of the Lord your God concerning his
        saints, that they should assemble themselves together unto the land of
        Zion, not in haste, lest there should be confusion, which bringeth pestilence.
        </span><verse>25</verse><span>Behold, the land of Zion—I, the Lord, hold it in mine own hands;
        </span><verse>26</verse><span>nevertheless, I, the Lord, render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s.
        </span><verse>27</verse><span>Wherefore, I the Lord will that you should purchase the lands, that you
        may have advantage of the world, that you may have claim on the world,
        that they may not be stirred up unto anger.
        </span><verse>28</verse><span>For Satan putteth it into their hearts to anger against you, and to the
        shedding of blood.
        </span><verse>29</verse><span>Wherefore, the land of Zion shall not be obtained but by
        purchase or by blood, otherwise there is none inheritance for you.
        </span><verse>30</verse><span>And if by purchase, behold you are blessed;
        </span><verse>31</verse><span>and if by blood, as you are forbidden to shed blood, lo, your enemies
        are upon you, and ye shall be scourged from city to city, and from synagogue
        to synagogue, and but few shall stand to receive an inheritance.

        <verse>32</verse><span>I, the Lord, am angry with the wicked; I am holding my Spirit from the

        </span><verse>33</verse><span>I have sworn in my wrath, and decreed wars upon the face of the earth,
        and the wicked shall slay the wicked, and fear shall come upon every man;
        </span><verse>34</verse><span>and the saints also shall hardly escape; nevertheless, I, the Lord, am
        with them, and will come down in

    <block>
        <verse>36</verse><span>Wherefore, seeing that I, the Lord, have decreed all these things upon
        the face of the earth, I will that my saints should be assembled upon the
        land of Zion;
        </span><verse>37</verse><span>and that every man should take righteousness in his hands and faithfulness
        upon his loins, and lift a

        <verse>47</verse><span>He that is faithful and endureth shall overcome the world.

        an inheritance before the Lord, in the holy
        city.
        </span><verse>50</verse><span>And he that liveth when the Lord shall come, and hath kept the faith,
        blessed is he; nevertheless, it is appointed to him to die at the age of

        </span><verse>51</verse><span>Wherefore, children shall grow up until they become old; old men shall
        die; but they shall not sleep in the dust, but they shall be changed in

        </span><verse>52</verse><span>Wherefore, for this cause preached the apostles unto the world the resurrection

    <block>
        <verse>53</verse><span>These things are the things that ye must look for; and, speaking after
        the manner of the Lord, they are now nigh at hand, and in a time to come,
        even in the day of the coming of the Son of Man.
        </span><verse>54</verse><span>And until that hour there will be foolish virgins among the wise; and
        at that hour cometh an entire separation of the righteous and the wicked;

        <verse>55</verse><span>And now behold, verily I say unto you, I, the Lord, am not pleased with

        </span><verse>56</verse><span>wherefore his writing is not acceptable unto the Lord, and he shall make

        who use the name of the

        </span><verse>63</verse><span>Wherefore, let the church repent of their

        The country is unlike the timbered states of the East. As far as the eye
        can reach the beautiful rolling prairies lie spread out like a sea of meadows;
        and are decorated with a growth of flowers so gorgeous and grand as to
        exceed description; and nothing is more
        fruitful, or a richer stockholder in the blooming prairie than the honey
        bee. Only on the water courses is timber to be found. There in strips from
        one to three miles in width, and following faithfully the meanderings of
        the streams, it grows in luxuriant forests. The forests are a mixture of
        oak, hickory, black walnut, elm, ash, cherry, honey locust,
        mulberry, coffee bean, hackberry, boxelder, and bass wood; with the addition
        of cottonwood, butterwood, pecan, and soft and hard maple upon the bottoms.
        The
        shrubbery is beautiful, and consists in part of plums, grapes, crab apple,
        and persimmons.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        The soil is rich and fertile; from three to ten feet deep, and generally
        composed of a rich black mould, intermingled with clay and sand. It yields
        in abundance, wheat, corn, sweet potatoes, cotton and many other common
        agricultural products. Horses, cattle and hogs, though of an inferior breed,
        are tolerably plentiful and seem nearly to raise themselves by grazing
        in the vast prairie range in summer, and feeding upon the bottoms in winter.
        The wild game is less plentiful of course where man has commenced the cultivation
        of the soil, than in the wild prairies. Buffalo, elk, deer, bear, wolves,
        beaver and many smaller animals here roam at pleasure. Turkeys, geese,
        swans, ducks, yea a variety of the feathered tribe,
        are among the rich abundance that grace the delightful regions of this
        goodly land—the heritage of the children of God.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        The season is mild and delightful nearly three quarters of the year, and
        as the land of Zion, situated at about equal distances from the Atlantic
        and Pacific oceans, as well as from the Alleghany and Rocky mountains,
        in the thirty-ninth degree of north latitude, and between the sixteenth
        and seventeenth degrees of west longitude, it bids fair—when the
        curse is taken from the land—to become one of the most blessed places
        on the globe. The winters are milder than the Atlantic states of the same
        parallel of latitude, and the weather is more agreeable; so that were the
        virtues of the inhabitants only equal to the blessings of the Lord which
        He permits to crown the industry of those inhabitants, there would be a
        measure of the good things of life for the benefit of the Saints, full,
        pressed down, and
        running over, even an hundredfold.

                HC: The early part of September was spent in making preparations to remove to the town of Hiram,
                and renew our work on the translation of the Bible. The brethren who were commanded to go up to
                Zion were earnestly engaged in getting ready to start in the coming October. On the 11th of September,
                I received the following:

        <verse>1</verse><span>Behold, thus saith the Lord your God unto you, O ye elders of my church,
        hearken ye and hear, and receive my will concerning you.
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>For verily I say unto you, I will that ye should overcome the world; wherefore
        I will have compassion upon you.
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>There are those among you who have sinned; but verily I say, for this
        once, for mine own glory, and for the salvation of souls, I have forgiven
        you your sins.
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>I will be merciful unto you, for I have given unto you the kingdom.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>5</verse><span>And the keys of the mysteries of the kingdom shall not be taken from my

            Smith, Jun., through the means I have appointed,
        </span></dunder><span>
        while he liveth, inasmuch as he obeyeth mine ordinances.
        </span><verse>6</verse><span>There are those who have sought occasion against him without cause;
        </span><verse>7</verse><span>nevertheless, he has sinned; but verily I say unto you, I, the Lord, forgive
        sins unto those who confess their sins before me and ask forgiveness, who
        have not sinned unto death.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>8</verse><span>My disciples, in days of old, sought occasion against one another and
        forgave not one another in their hearts; and for this evil they were afflicted
        and sorely chastened.
        </span><verse>9</verse><span>Wherefore, I say unto you, that ye ought to forgive one another; for he
        that forgiveth not his brother his trespasses standeth condemned before
        the Lord; for there remaineth in him the greater sin.
        </span><verse>10</verse><span>I, the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive, but of you it is required
        to forgive all men.
        </span><verse>11</verse><span>And ye ought to say in your hearts, “Let God judge between me and thee,
        and reward thee according to thy deeds.”
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>12</verse><span>And him that repenteth not of his sins, and confesseth them not, ye shall
        bring before the church, and do with him as the scripture saith unto you,
        either by commandment or by
        revelation.
        </span><verse>13</verse><span>And this ye shall do that God may be glorified—not because ye forgive
        not, having not compassion, but that ye may be justified in the eyes of
        the law, that ye may not offend him who is your lawgiver—
        </span><verse>14</verse><span>verily I say, for this cause ye shall do these things.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>15</verse><span>Behold, I, the Lord, was angry with him who was my servant Ezra Booth,
        and also my servant Isaac Morley, for they kept not the law, neither the
        commandment;
        </span><verse>16</verse><span>they sought evil in their hearts, and I, the Lord, withheld my Spirit.
        They condemned for evil that thing in which there was no evil; nevertheless
        I have forgiven my servant Isaac Morley.
        </span><verse>17</verse><span>And also my servant Edward Partridge, behold, he hath sinned, and Satan
        seeketh to
        destroy his soul; but when these things are made known unto them, and
        they repent of the evil, they shall be forgiven.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>18</verse><span>And now, verily I say that it is expedient in me that my servant Sidney
        Gilbert, after a
        few weeks, shall return upon his business, and to his agency in the land
        of Zion;
        </span><verse>19</verse><span>and that which he hath seen and heard may be made known unto my disciples,
        that they perish not. And for this cause have I spoken these things.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>20</verse><span>And again, I say unto you, that my servant Isaac
        </span><dunder><span>
            Morley
        </span></dunder><span>
        may not be tempted above that which he is able to bear, and counsel wrongfully
        to your hurt, I gave commandment that his farm should be sold.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>21</verse><span>I will not that my servant Frederick G. Williams should sell his farm,
        for I, the Lord,
        will to retain a strong hold in the land of Kirtland, for the space of
        five years, in the which I will not overthrow the wicked, that thereby
        I may save some.
        </span><verse>22</verse><span>And after that day, I, the
        Lord, will not hold any guilty that shall go with an open heart up to
        the land of Zion; for I, the Lord, require the hearts of the children of
        men.

        </span></dunder><span>
        , and verily it is a day of sacrifice, and a day for the tithing of my
        people; for he that is tithed shall not be burned
        </span><dunder><span>
            at his coming
        </span></dunder><span>.
        </span><verse>24</verse><span>For after today cometh the burning—this is speaking after the manner of
        the Lord—for verily I say, tomorrow all the proud and they that do wickedly
        shall be as stubble; and I will burn them up, for I am the Lord of Hosts;
        and I will not spare any that remain in Babylon.
        </span><verse>25</verse><span>Wherefore, if ye believe me, ye will labor while it is called today.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>26</verse><span>And it is not meet that my servants, Newel K. Whitney and Sidney Gilbert,
        should sell their store and their possessions here; for this is not wisdom
        until the residue of the church, which remaineth in this place, shall go
        up unto the land of Zion.

        <verse>27</verse><span>Behold, it is said in my laws, or forbidden, to get in debt to thine enemies;
        </span><verse>28</verse><span>but behold, it is not said at any time that the Lord should not take when
        he please, and pay as seemeth him good.
        </span><verse>29</verse><span>Wherefore, as ye are agents, ye are on the Lord’s errand; and whatever
        ye do according to the will of the Lord is the Lord’s business.

            <bc><span>it is the Lord’s business</span></bc><span>
            he hath set you

        to provide for his saints in these last days, that they may obtain an

        <verse>34</verse><span>Behold, the Lord requireth the heart and a willing mind; and the willing
        and obedient shall eat the good of the land of Zion in these last days.
        </span><verse>35</verse><span>And the rebellious shall be cut off out of the land of Zion, and shall
        be sent away, and shall not inherit the land.
        </span><verse>36</verse><span>For, verily I say that the rebellious are not of the blood of Ephraim,
        wherefore they shall be plucked out.

        <verse>37</verse><span>Behold, I, the Lord, have made my church in these last days like unto
        a judge sitting on a hill, or in a high place, to judge the nations.
        </span><verse>38</verse><span>For it shall come to pass that the inhabitants of Zion shall judge all

        shall be condemned, and others shall be planted in their stead.

        the Lord shall be upon her;

        her out of every nation under heaven.

        <verse>1</verse><span>Behold, thus saith the Lord unto my servant William E. McLellin:
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Blessed are you, inasmuch as you have turned away from your iniquities,
        and have received my truths, saith the Lord your Redeemer, the Savior of the world,
        even of as many as believe on my name.
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>Verily I say unto you, blessed are you for receiving mine everlasting
        covenant, even the fulness of my gospel, sent forth unto the children of
        men, that they might have life and be made partakers of the glories which
        are to be revealed in the last days, as it was written by the prophets
        and apostles in days of old.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>3</verse><span>Verily I say unto you, my servant William, that you are clean, but not
        all; repent,
        therefore, of those things which are not pleasing in my sight, saith the
        Lord, for the Lord will show them unto you.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>4</verse><span>And now, verily, I, the Lord, will show unto you what I will concerning
        you, or what is my will concerning you.
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>Behold, verily I say unto you, that it is my will that you should proclaim
        my gospel from land to land, and from city to city, yea, in those regions
        round about where it has not been proclaimed.
        </span><verse>6</verse><span>Tarry not many days in this place; go not up
        unto the land of Zion as yet; but inasmuch as you can send, send; otherwise,
        think not of thy property.
        </span><verse>7</verse><span>Go unto the eastern lands, bear testimony in every place, unto every people
        and in their synagogues, reasoning with the people.
        </span><verse>8</verse><span>Let my servant Samuel H. Smith go with you, and forsake him not, and give
        him thine instructions; and he that is faithful shall be made strong in
        every place; and I, the Lord, will go with you.
        </span><verse>9</verse><span>Lay your hands upon the sick, and they shall recover. Return not till
        I, the Lord, shall send you.

        Be patient in affliction. Ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall

        temptation with which thou hast been troubled.
        </span><verse>11</verse><span>Keep these sayings, for they are true and faithful; and thou shalt magnify
        thine office, and push many people to Zion with songs of everlasting joy
        upon their heads.
        </span><verse>12</verse><span>Continue in these things even unto the end, and you shall have a crown

        truth.

                HC: After this revelation was received, some conversation was had concerning revelations and
                language. I received the following:
            </span></block>

        </sectioninfo>
    </sectionheader><chapter style="display: none">1</chapter>
    <block>
        <verse>1</verse><span>Behold and hearken, O ye elders of my church, who have assembled yourselves
        together, whose prayers I have heard, and whose hearts I know, and whose
        desires have come up before me.
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>Behold and lo, mine eyes are upon you, and the heavens and the earth are
        in mine hands, and the riches of eternity are mine to give.
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>Ye endeavored to believe that ye should receive the blessing which was
        offered unto you; but behold, verily I say unto you there were fears in
        your hearts, and verily this is the reason that ye did not receive.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>4</verse><span>And now I, the Lord, give unto you a testimony of the truth of these commandments
        which are lying before you.
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>Your eyes have been upon my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and his language
        you have known, and his imperfections you have known; and you have sought
        in your hearts knowledge that you might express beyond his language; this
        you also know.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>6</verse><span>Now, seek ye out of the
        Book Of Commandments,
        even the least that is among them, and appoint him that is the most
        wise among you;
        </span><verse>7</verse><span>or, if there be any among you that shall make one like unto it, then ye
        are justified in saying that ye do not know that they are
        true;
        </span><verse>8</verse><span>but if ye cannot make one like unto it, ye are under condemnation if ye
        do not bear record that they are true.
        </span><verse>9</verse><span>For ye know that there is no unrighteousness in them, and that which is
        righteous cometh down from above, from the Father of lights.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>10</verse><span>And again, verily I say unto you that it is your privilege, and a promise
        I give unto you that have been ordained unto this ministry, that inasmuch
        as you strip yourselves from
        jealousies and fears, and humble yourselves before me, for ye are not
        sufficiently humble, the veil shall be rent and you shall see me and know
        that I am—not with the carnal neither natural mind, but with the spiritual.
        </span><verse>11</verse><span>For no man has seen God at any time in the flesh,
        except quickened by the Spirit of God.
        </span><verse>12</verse><span>Neither can any natural man abide the presence of God, neither after the
        carnal mind.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>13</verse><span>Ye are not able to abide the presence of God now, neither the ministering
        of angels;
        wherefore, continue in patience until ye are perfected.
        </span><verse>14</verse><span>Let not your minds turn back; and when ye are worthy, in mine own due
        time, ye shall see and know that which was
        conferred upon you by the hands of my servant Joseph Smith, Jun.</span><break></break><span>Amen.

                HC: After the foregoing was received, William McLellin…endeavored to write a commandment like
                unto one of the least of the Lord’s, but failed; it was an awful responsibility to write in the name of the
                Lord. The Elders and all present that witnessed this vain attempt of a man to imitate the language of
                Jesus Christ, renewed their faith in the fulness of the Gospel, and in the truth of the commandments
                and revelations which the Lord had given to the Church through my instrumentality; and the Elders
                signified a willingness to bear testimony of their truth to all the world. Accordingly, I received the
                following:

        We the undersigners feel willing to bear testimony to all the world of
        mankind, to every creature upon all the face of all the earth, upon the
        islands of the sea, that God hath born
        record to our souls through the Holy Ghost shed forth upon us, that these
        commandments are given by inspiration of God and are profitable for all
        men and are verily true. We give this testimony unto the world, the Lord
        being our helper; and it is through the grace of God the Father and his
        Son Jesus Christ that we are permitted to have this privilege of
        bearing this testimony unto the world, in the which we rejoice exceedingly
        by praying the Lord always that the children of men may be profited thereby,</span><break></break><span>Amen.

                HC: At this time there were many things which the Elders desired to know relative to preaching the
                Gospel to the inhabitants of the earth, and concerning the gathering; and in order to walk by the true
                light, and be instructed from on high, on the 3rd of November 1831, I inquired of the Lord and received

                HC: In consequence of the book of revelations being the foundation of the Church in these last days,
                and a benefit to the world, showing that the keys of the mysteries of the kingdom of our Savior are
                again entrusted to man; and the riches of eternity within the compass of those who are willing to live
                by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God—therefore the conference voted that they
                prize the revelations to be worth to the Church the riches of the whole earth, speaking temporally. The
                great benefits to the world which result from the
                Book of Mormon
                and the revelations which the Lord
                has seen fit in His infinite wisdom to grant unto us for our salvation, and for the salvation of all that will
                believe, were duly appreciated; and in answer to an inquiry, I received the following:

        judgment.
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>Wherefore, I have appointed unto them, and this is their business in the
        church of God, to manage them and the concerns thereof, yea, the benefits
        thereof.
        </span><verse>6</verse><span>Wherefore, a commandment I give unto them, that they shall not give these
        things unto the church, neither unto the world;
        </span><verse>7</verse><span>nevertheless, inasmuch as they receive more than is needful for their
        necessities and their wants, it shall be given into my storehouse;

        unto their generations, inasmuch as they become heirs according to the
        laws of the kingdom.

        in temporal things;

        the manifestations of the Spirit.
        </span><verse>14</verse><span>Nevertheless, in your temporal things you shall be equal, and this not
        grudgingly, otherwise the abundance of the manifestations of the Spirit
        shall be withheld.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>15</verse><span>Now, this commandment I give unto my servants for their benefit while
        they remain, for a manifestation of my blessings upon their heads, and
        for a reward of their diligence and for their security;
        </span><verse>16</verse><span>for food and for raiment; for an inheritance; for houses and for

        as they have not sinned.

                the above revelation. On the 4th, several of the Elders and members assembled together to learn their

        </span><verse>3</verse><span>And verily in this thing ye have done wisely, for it is required of the

                HC: From this time until the 8th or 10th of January, 1832, myself and Elder Rigdon continued to preach
                in Shalersville, Ravenna, and other places, setting forth the truth, vindicating the cause of our
                Redeemer; showing that the day of vengeance was coming upon this generation like a thief in the
                night; that prejudice, blindness and darkness filled the minds of many, and caused them to persecute
                the true Church, and reject the true light; by which means we did much towards allaying the excited
                feelings which were growing out of the scandalous letters then being published in the Ohio Star, at
                Ravenna, by the before-mentioned apostate, Ezra Booth. On the 10th of January, I received the
                following revelation making known the will of the Lord concerning the Elders of the Church until the
                convening of the next conference.

                what would be most pleasing to Him for them to do, in order to bring men to a sense of their
                condition; for, as it was written, “all men have gone out of the way, so that none doeth good, no not
                one.” I inquired and received the following:

        according to the revelations and commandments which I have given you.

        the commission which I gave unto him to go unto the eastern countries;
        </span><verse>7</verse><span>and I give unto him a new
        commission and a new commandment, in the which I, the Lord, chasten him
        for the murmurings of his heart;
        </span><verse>8</verse><span>and he sinned; nevertheless, I forgive him and say unto him
        again, “Go ye into the south countries.”

        all things that are expedient for them—

    <block>
        <verse>18</verse><span>Yea, let all those take their journey, as I have commanded them, going
        from house to house, and from village to village, and from city to city.

        upon that house.
        </span><verse>20</verse><span>And in whatsoever house ye enter, and they receive you not, ye shall depart

        </span><verse>21</verse><span>And you shall be filled with joy and gladness; and know this, that in
        the day of judgment you shall be judges of that house, and condemn them;
        </span><verse>22</verse><span>and it shall be more tolerable for the heathen in the day of judgment,
        than for that house; therefore, gird up your loins and be faithful, and

                HC: I resumed the translation of the Scriptures. From sundry revelations which had been received, it
                was apparent that many important points touching the salvation of man had been taken from the
                Bible, or lost before it was compiled. It appeared self-evident from what truths were left, that if God
                rewarded everyone according to the deeds done in the body, the term ‘heaven’ as intended for the
                Saints’ eternal home must include more kingdoms that one. Accordingly, on the 16th of February, 1832,
                while translating St. John’s Gospel, myself and Elder Rigdon saw the following vision:

        about.
        </span><verse>20</verse><span>And we beheld the glory of the Son, on the right hand of the Father, and
        received of his fulness;

        bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father—

        down from the presence of God and the Son,

                HC: About the first of March, in connection with the translation of the Scriptures, I received the
                following explanation of the Revelation of St. John:
            </span></block>

    <verse>1</verse><question><span>
        What is the sea of glass spoken of by John, 4</span><superscript><span>th</span></superscript><span>
        chapter, and 6</span><superscript><span>th</span></superscript><span>
        verse of the Revelation?
    </span></question>
    <block><span>
        It is the earth, in its sanctified, immortal, and eternal state.
    </span></block>

    <verse>2</verse><question><span>What are we to understand by the four beasts, spoken of in the same verse?</span></question>
    <block><span>
        They are figurative expressions, used by the Revelator, John, in describing
        heaven, the paradise of God, the happiness of man, and of beasts, and of
        creeping things, and of the fowls of the air; that which is spiritual being
        in the likeness of that which is temporal; and that which is temporal in
        the likeness of that which is spiritual; the spirit of man in the
        likeness of his person, as also the spirit of the beast, and every other
        creature which God has created.
    </span></block>

    <verse>3</verse><question><span>Are the four beasts limited to individual beasts, or do they represent classes or orders?</span></question>
    <block><span>
        They are limited to four individual beasts, which were shown to John,
        to represent the glory of the classes of beings in their destined order
        or sphere of creation, in the enjoyment of their eternal felicity.
    </span></block>

    <verse>4</verse><question><span>What are we to understand by the eyes and wings, which the beasts had?</span></question>
    <block><span>
        Their eyes are a representation of light and knowledge, that is, they
        are full of knowledge; and their wings are a representation of power, to
        move, to act, etc.
    </span></block>

    <verse>5</verse><question><span>What are we to understand by the four and twenty elders, spoken of by John?</span></question>
    <block><span>
        We are to understand that these elders whom John saw, were elders who
        had been faithful in the work of the ministry and were dead; who belonged
        to the seven churches, and were then in the paradise of God.
    </span></block>

    <verse>6</verse><question><span>What are we to understand by the book which John saw, which was sealed on the back with seven seals?</span></question>
    <block><span>
        We are to understand that it contains the revealed will, mysteries, and
        the works of God; the hidden things of his economy concerning this earth
        during the seven thousand years of its continuance, or its temporal existence.
    </span></block>

    <verse>7</verse><question><span>What are we to understand by the seven seals with which it was sealed?</span></question>
    <block><span>
        We are to understand that the first seal contains the things of the first
        thousand years, and the second also of the second thousand years, and so
        on until the seventh.
    </span></block>

    <verse>8</verse><question><span>
        What are we to understand by the four angels, spoken of in the 7</span><superscript><span>th</span></superscript><span>
        chapter and 1</span><superscript><span>st</span></superscript><span>
        verse of Revelation?
    </span></question>
    <block><span>
        We are to understand that they are four angels sent forth from God, to
        whom is given power over the four parts of the earth, to save life and
        to destroy; these are they who have the everlasting gospel to commit to
        every nation, kindred, tongue, and people; having power to shut up the
        heavens, to seal up unto life, or to cast down to the regions of
        darkness.
    </span></block>

    <verse>9</verse><question><span>
        What are we to understand by the angel ascending from the east, Revelation 7</span><superscript><span>th</span></superscript><span>
        chapter and 2</span><superscript><span>nd</span></superscript><span>
        verse?
    </span></question>
    <block><span>
        We are to understand that the angel ascending from the east is he to whom
        is given the seal of the living God over the twelve tribes of Israel; wherefore,
        he crieth unto the four angels having the everlasting gospel, saying:
        </span><quote><span>
            Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed
            the servants of our God in their foreheads.
        </span></quote>
    </block>

    <block><span>
        And, if you will receive it, this is Elias which was to come to gather
        together the tribes of Israel and restore all things.
    </span></block>

    <verse>10</verse><question><span>What time are the things spoken of in this chapter to be accomplished?</span></question>
    <block><span>
        They are to be accomplished in the sixth thousand years, or the opening
        of the sixth seal.
    </span></block>

    <verse>11</verse><question><span>What are we to understand by sealing the one hundred and forty-four thousand, out of all the tribes of Israel—twelve thousand out of every tribe?</span></question>
    <block><span>
        We are to understand that those who are sealed are high priests, ordained
        unto the holy order of God, to administer the everlasting gospel; for they
        are they who are ordained out of every nation, kindred, tongue, and people,
        by the angels to whom is given power over the nations of the earth, to
        bring as many as will come to the church of the Firstborn.
    </span></block>

    <verse>12</verse><question><span>
        What are we to understand by the sounding of the trumpets, mentioned in the 8</span><superscript><span>th</span></superscript><span>
        chapter of Revelation?
    </span></question>
    <block><span>
        We are to understand that as God made the world in six days, and on the
        seventh day he
        finished his work, and sanctified it, and also formed man out of the dust
        of the earth, even so, in the beginning of the seventh thousand years will
        the Lord God sanctify the earth, and complete the salvation of man, and
        judge all things, and shall redeem all things, except that which he hath
        not put into his power, when he shall have sealed all things, unto the
        end of all things; and the sounding of the trumpets of the seven angels
        are the preparing and finishing of his work, in the beginning of the seventh
        thousand years—the preparing of the way before the time of his coming.
    </span></block>

    <verse>13</verse><question><span>
        When are the things to be accomplished, which are written in the 9</span><superscript><span>th</span></superscript><span>
        chapter of Revelation?
    </span></question>
    <block><span>
        They are to be accomplished after the opening of the seventh seal, before
        the coming of Christ.
    </span></block>

    <verse>14</verse><question><span>
        What are we to understand by the little book which was eaten by John, as mentioned in the 10</span><superscript><span>th</span></superscript><span>
        chapter of Revelation?
    </span></question>
    <block><span>
        We are to understand that it was a mission, and an ordinance, for him
        to gather the tribes of Israel; behold, this is Elias, who, as it is written,
        must come and restore all things.
    </span></block>

    <verse>15</verse><question><span>
        What is to be understood by the two witnesses, in the 11</span><superscript><span>th</span></superscript><span>
        chapter of Revelation?
    </span></question>
    <block><span>
        They are two prophets that are to be raised up to the Jewish nation in
        the last days, at the time of the restoration, and to prophesy to the Jews
        after they are gathered and have built the city of Jerusalem in the land
        of their fathers.

        <verse>1</verse><span>The Lord spake unto Joseph Smith, Jun., saying:
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Hearken unto me, saith the Lord your God, who are ordained unto the high
        priesthood of my church, who have assembled yourselves together;
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>and listen to the counsel of him
        who has ordained you from on high, who shall speak in your ears the words
        of wisdom, that salvation may be unto you in that thing which you have
        presented before me, saith the Lord God.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>3</verse><span>For verily I say unto you, the time has come, and is now at hand; and
        behold, and lo, it must needs be that there be an organization of my people,
        in regulating and establishing the affairs of the storehouse for the poor
        of my people, both in this place and in the land of Zion—
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>for a permanent and everlasting establishment and order unto my church,
        to
        advance the cause, which ye have espoused, to the salvation of man, and
        to the glory of your Father who is in heaven;
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>that you may be equal in the bonds of heavenly things, yea,
        and earthly things also, for the obtaining of heavenly things.
        </span><verse>6</verse><span>For if ye are not equal in earthly things ye cannot be equal in obtaining
        heavenly things;
        </span><verse>7</verse><span>for if you will that I give unto you a place in the celestial world, you
        must prepare yourselves by doing the things which I have commanded you
        and required of you.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>8</verse><span>And now, verily thus saith the Lord, it is expedient that all things be
        done unto my glory, by you who are joined together in this order;
        </span><verse>9</verse><span>or, in other words, let my servant Newel K. Whitney and my servant Joseph
        Smith, Jun., and my servant Sidney Rigdon sit in council with the saints
        which are in Zion;
        </span><verse>10</verse><span>otherwise Satan seeketh to turn their hearts away from the truth, that
        they become blinded and understand not the things which are prepared for
        them.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>11</verse><span>Wherefore, a commandment I give unto you, to prepare and organize yourselves
        by a bond or everlasting covenant that cannot be broken.
        </span><verse>12</verse><span>And he who breaks it shall lose his office and standing in the church,
        and shall be delivered over to the buffetings of Satan until the day of
        redemption.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>13</verse><span>Behold, this is the preparation wherewith I prepare you, and the foundation,
        and the ensample which I give unto you, whereby you may accomplish the
        commandments which are given you;
        </span><verse>14</verse><span>that through my providence, notwithstanding the tribulation which shall
        descend upon you, that the church may stand independent above all other
        creatures beneath the celestial world;
        </span><verse>15</verse><span>that you may come up unto the crown prepared for you, and be made rulers
        over many kingdoms, saith the Lord God, the Holy One of Zion, who hath
        established the foundations of Adam-ondi-Ahman;
        </span><verse>16</verse><span>who hath appointed
        Michael your prince, and established his feet, and set him upon high,
        and given unto him the keys of salvation under the counsel and direction
        of the Holy One, who is without beginning of days or end of life.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>17</verse><span>Verily, verily, I say unto you, ye are little children, and ye have not
        as yet understood how great blessings the Father hath in his own hands
        and prepared for you;
        </span><verse>18</verse><span>and ye
        cannot bear all things now; nevertheless, be of good cheer, for I will
        lead you along. The kingdom is yours and the blessings thereof are yours,
        and the riches of eternity are yours.
        </span><verse>19</verse><span>And he who receiveth all things with thankfulness shall be made glorious;
        and the things of this earth shall be added unto him, even an hundred fold,
        yea, more.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>20</verse><span>Wherefore, do the things which I have commanded you, saith your Redeemer,
        even the Son Ahman, who prepareth all things before he taketh you;
        </span><verse>21</verse><span>for ye are the church of the Firstborn, and he will take you up in a cloud,
        and appoint every man his portion.
        </span><verse>22</verse><span>And he that is a faithful and wise steward shall inherit all things.</span><break></break><span>Amen.

                Jared Carter spent much of late 1831 and early 1832 proselytizing in Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, and
                Vermont. A few weeks after returning home to Amherst, Ohio, he traveled to Hiram, Ohio, where
                Joseph Smith was living. Carter recorded in his journal that the purpose of his trip was to visit the Seer to inquire the will of the Lord concerning his ministry the ensuing season.

                Stephen Burnett was ordained to the high priesthood at the October 1831 conference when he was
                seventeen. At the January 25, 1832 conference in Amherst, Ohio, Joseph dictated a revelation
                appointing Burnett to travel and preach with Ruggles Eames. This revelation appointed Burnett to
                travel and preach again, this time with Eden Smith. However, the two did not preach together until
                August 1832 because Eden Smith became sick and remained ill for some time. Instead, two weeks after
                this revelation was dictated, Burnett began his mission with John Smith, Eden’s father.

                On March 8, 1832, Joseph appointed Jesse Gause and Sidney Rigdon as counselors “of the ministry of
                the presidency of the high Priesthood.” Gause had only recently been baptized sometime in late 1831
                or early 1832. This revelation initially addressed Gause and his duties as counselor. In January 1833,
                Frederick G. Williams replaced Gause as counselor. Sometime before the 1835
                Doctrine And Covenants
                was published, Gause’s name was crossed out in the manuscript and replaced with Williams’ name.

        private, also in thy ministry in proclaiming the gospel in the land of
        the living, and among thy brethren.
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>And in doing these things thou wilt do the greatest good unto thy fellow
        beings, and wilt promote the glory of him who is your Lord.
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>Wherefore, be faithful; stand in the office which I have appointed unto
        you; succor the weak, lift up the hands which hang down, and strengthen
        the feeble knees.
        </span><verse>6</verse><span>And if thou art faithful unto the end thou shalt have a crown of immortality,

                D&amp;C 78 called for the establishment of a firm to oversee the church’s publishing and mercantile
                efforts, declaring that such a firm would help the church in its quest to be “equal in earthly things.” The
                firm’s mandate overlapped somewhat with Whitney’s and Partridge’s financial responsibilities as
                bishops. Joseph received this revelation between March 8th and 24th.

        Verily thus saith the Lord unto you my servant Sidney Rigdon and Joseph.
        I reveal unto you, for your own profit and instruction, concerning the
        Bishops of my church: what is their duty in the church. Behold, it is their
        duty to stand in the office of their bishopric, and to fill the judgement
        seat which I have appointed unto them to, and to administer the benefits
        of the church or the overplus of all who are in their stewardships, according
        to the commandments as they are severly appointed. And the property, or
        that which they
        receive of the church, is not their own but belongeth to the church, wherefore
        it is the property of the Lord. And it is for the poor of the church, to
        be administered according to the law. For it is the will of the Lord that
        the church should be made equal in all things.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Wherefore the bishops are accountable before the Lord for their stewardships,
        to
        administer of their stewardship, in the which they are appointed by commandment
        jointly with you, my servants unto the Lord, as well as you my servants,
        or the rest of the church, that the benefits of all may be dedicated unto
        the Lord, that the Lords storehouse may be filled always, that ye may all
        grow in temporal as well as spiritual things.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        And now, verily I say unto you, the bishops must needs be separated unto
        their bishoprics and judgement seats from care of business, but not from
        claim neither from council.
        Wherefore I have given unto you commandment that you should be joined
        together by covenant and bond, wherefore see that ye do even as I have
        commanded.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        And unto the office of the presidency of the high Priesthood I have given
        authority to
        preside with the assistance of his councilors over all the concerns of
        the church, wherefore stand ye fast. Claim your priesthood in authority
        yet in meekness. And I am able to make you abound and be fruitful and you
        shall never fall, for unto you I have given the keys of the kingdom, and
        if you transgress not they shall never be taken from you, wherefore feed
        my sheep. Even so, Amen.

                HC: On the 26th, I called a general council of the Church ... During the intermission, a difficulty or
                hardness which had existed between Bishop Partridge and Elder Rigdon was amicably settled, and
                when we came together in the afternoon, all hearts seemed to rejoice and I received the following:

    <block>
        <verse>1</verse><span>Verily, verily, I say unto you, my servants, that inasmuch as you have
        forgiven one another your trespasses, even so I, the Lord, forgive you.
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>Nevertheless, there are those among you who have sinned exceedingly; yea,
        even all of you have sinned; but verily I say unto you, beware from henceforth,
        and refrain from sin, lest sore judgments fall upon your heads.
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>For of him unto whom much is given much is required; and he who sins against
        the greater light shall receive the greater condemnation.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>4</verse><span>Ye call upon my name for revelations, and I give them unto you; and inasmuch
        as ye keep not my sayings, which I give unto you, ye become transgressors;
        and justice and
        judgment are the penalty which is affixed unto my law.
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>Therefore, what I say unto one I say unto all:
        </span><quote><span>
            Watch, for the adversary spreads his dominions, and darkness reigneth;
            </span><verse>6</verse><span>and the anger of God kindleth against the inhabitants of the earth; and
            none doeth good, for all have gone out of the way.

        <verse>7</verse><span>And now, verily I say unto you, I, the Lord, will not lay any sin to your
        charge; go your ways and sin no more; but unto that soul who sinneth shall
        the former sins return, saith the Lord your God.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>8</verse><span>And again, I say unto you, I give unto you a new commandment, that you
        may
        understand my will concerning you;
        </span><verse>9</verse><span>or, in other words, I give unto you directions how you may act before
        me, that it may turn to you for your salvation.
        </span><verse>10</verse><span>I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say; but when ye do not what I
        say, ye have no promise.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>11</verse><span>Therefore, verily I say unto you, that it is expedient for my servants
        Edward Partridge and Newel K. Whitney, A. Sidney Gilbert and Sidney Rigdon,
        and my servant Joseph
        Smith, and John Whitmer and Oliver Cowdery, and W. W. Phelps and Martin
        Harris to be bound together by a bond and covenant that cannot be broken
        by transgression, except
        judgment shall immediately follow, in your several stewardships—
        </span><verse>12</verse><span>to manage the affairs of the poor, and all things pertaining to the bishopric
        both in the land of Zion and in the land of Kirtland;
        </span><verse>13</verse><span>for I have consecrated the land of Kirtland in mine own due time for the
        benefit of the saints of the Most High, and for a stake to Zion.
        </span><verse>14</verse><span>For Zion must
        increase in beauty, and in holiness; her borders must be enlarged; her
        stakes must be strengthened; yea, verily I say unto you, Zion must arise
        and put on her beautiful
        garments.
        </span><verse>15</verse><span>Therefore, I give unto you this commandment, that ye bind yourselves by
        this covenant, and it shall be done according to the laws of the Lord.
        </span><verse>16</verse><span>Behold, here is wisdom also in me for your good.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>17</verse><span>And you are to be equal, or in other words, you are to have equal claims
        on the properties, for the benefit of managing the concerns of your stewardships,
        every man
        according to his wants and his needs, inasmuch as his wants are just—
        </span><verse>18</verse><span>and all this for the benefit of the church of the living God, that every
        man may improve upon his talent, that every man may gain other talents,
        yea, even an hundred fold, to be cast into the Lord’s storehouse, to become
        the common property of the whole church—
        </span><verse>19</verse><span>every man seeking the interest of his neighbor, and doing all things with
        an eye single to the glory of God.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>20</verse><span>This order I have appointed to be an everlasting order unto you, and unto
        your
        successors, inasmuch as you sin not.
        </span><verse>21</verse><span>And the soul that sins against this covenant, and
        hardeneth his heart against it, shall be dealt with according to the laws
        of my church, and shall be delivered over to the buffetings of Satan until
        the day of redemption.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>22</verse><span>And now, verily I say unto you, and this is wisdom, make unto yourselves
        friends with the mammon of unrighteousness, and they will not destroy you.
        </span><verse>23</verse><span>Leave judgment alone with me, for it is mine and I will repay. Peace be
        with you; my blessings continue with you.
        </span><verse>24</verse><span>For even yet the kingdom is yours, and shall be forever, if you fall not
        from your steadfastness. Even so.</span><break></break><span>Amen.

                Following his baptism in Kirtland in November 1830, Murdock spent much time as a traveling
                missionary. In early 1831, Murdock decided to devote himself “full time to the ministry” and moved his
                family in with another family so that he could do so. In June 1831, D&amp;C 52 instructed him to go to Missouri, “preaching the word by the way.” Murdock departed for Missouri despite the recent death of
                his wife during childbirth, which left him with five children under the age of seven, including newborn
                twins. Before leaving, he arranged for several individuals to watch over his older children; Joseph and
                Emma Smith adopted the twins.

                When he returned to Hiram, Ohio, in June 1832, he found that one of the twins had died in March. In
                addition, those with whom he had left his three older children demanded payment for their help.

        not to continue faithful in all things, shall not be weary in
        mind, neither darkened, neither in body, limb, nor joint; and a hair of

        in your minds continually the words of life, and it shall be given you
        in the very hour that portion that shall be meted unto every man.
        </span><verse>86</verse><span>Therefore, let no man among you, for this commandment is unto all the

        <verse>1</verse><span>It is the duty of the Lord’s clerk, whom he has appointed, to keep a history,

        <verse>3</verse><span>It is contrary to the will and commandment of God that those who receive
        not their inheritance by consecration, agreeable to his law, which he has
        given, that he may tithe his people, to prepare them against the day of
        vengeance and burning, should have their names enrolled with the people
        of God.
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>Neither is their genealogy to be kept, or to be had where it may be found
        on any of the records or history of the church.

        the Lord of Hosts.

        <verse>6</verse><span>Yea, thus saith the still small voice, which whispereth through and pierceth

            a covering, whose mouth shall utter words, eternal words; while his bowels
            shall be a fountain of truth, to set in order the house of God, and to
            arrange by lot the inheritances of the saints
            whose names are found, and the names of their fathers, and of their children,
            enrolled in the book of the law of God;

            his hand to steady the ark of God, shall fall by the shaft
            of death, like as a tree that is smitten by the vivid shaft of lightning.
            </span><verse>9</verse><span>And all they who are not found written in the book of remembrance shall
            find none inheritance in that day, but they shall be cut asunder, and their

            unbelievers, where are wailing and gnashing of teeth.

        been cut off from the church, as well as the lesser priesthood, or the

        <verse>1</verse><span>Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you my servants, concerning the parable
        of the wheat and of the tares:
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>2</verse><span>Behold, verily I say, the field was the world, and the apostles were the
        sowers of the seed;
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>and after they have fallen asleep the great persecutor of the church,
        the apostate, the whore, even Babylon, that maketh all nations to drink
        of her cup, in whose hearts the enemy, even Satan, sitteth to reign—behold
        he soweth the tares; wherefore, the tares choke the wheat and drive the
        church into the wilderness.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>4</verse><span>But behold, in the last days, even now while the Lord is beginning to
        bring forth the word, and the blade is springing up and is yet tender—
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>behold, verily I say unto you, the angels are crying unto the Lord day
        and night, who are ready and waiting to be sent forth to reap down the
        fields;
        </span><verse>6</verse><span>but the Lord says unto them:

            <note><span>KJV Matthew 13:30 Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn.</span></note><span>
            Pluck not up the tares while the blade is yet tender (for verily your
            faith is weak), lest you destroy the wheat also.
            </span><verse>7</verse><span>Therefore, let the wheat and the tares grow together
            until the harvest is fully ripe; then ye shall first gather out the wheat
            from among the tares, and after the gathering of the wheat, behold and
            lo, the tares are bound in
            bundles, and the field remaineth to be burned.

        the world with Christ in God—

                HC: Appearances of troubles among the nations became more visible this season than they had
                previously been since the Church began her journey out of the wilderness. The ravages of the cholera
                were frightful in almost all the large cities on the globe. The plague broke out in India, while the United
                States, amid all her pomp and greatness, was threatened with immediate dissolution. The people of
                South Carolina, in convention assembled in November, passed ordinances, declaring their state a free
                and independent nation; and appointed Thursday, the 31st day of January, 1833, as a day of
                humiliation and prayer, to implore Almighty God to vouchsafe His blessings, and restore liberty and
                happiness within their borders. President Jackson issued his proclamation against this rebellion, called
                out a force sufficient to quell it, and implored the blessings of God to assist the nation to extricate itself
                from the horrors of the approaching and solemn crisis. On Christmas day, I received the following
                revelation and prophecy on war.

        States, and the Southern States will call on other nations, even the nation
        of Great Britain, as it is called, and they shall also call upon other
        nations, in order to defend themselves against other nations; and then
        war shall be poured out upon all nations.

        of the earth be made to feel the wrath, and

        Parable of the twelve servants
    </span></heading>

    <block>
        <verse>46</verse><span>Unto what shall I liken these kingdoms, that ye may understand?
        </span><verse>47</verse><span>Behold, all these are kingdoms, and any man who hath seen any or the least
        of these hath seen God moving in his majesty and power.
        </span><verse>48</verse><span>I say unto you, he hath seen him; nevertheless, he who came unto his own
        was not comprehended.
        </span><verse>49</verse><span>The light shineth in darkness, and the darkness
        comprehendeth it not; nevertheless, the day shall come when you shall
        comprehend even God, being quickened in him and by him.
        </span><verse>50</verse><span>Then shall ye know that ye have seen me, that I am, and that I am the
        true light that is in you, and that you are in me; otherwise ye
        could not abound.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>51</verse><span>Behold, I will liken these kingdoms unto a man having a field, and he
        sent forth his
        servants into the field to dig in the field.
        </span><verse>52</verse><span>And he said unto the first, “Go ye and labor in the field, and in the
        first hour I will come unto you, and ye shall behold the joy of my countenance.”
        </span><verse>53</verse><span>And he said unto the second, “Go ye also into the field, and in the second
        hour I will visit you with the joy of my countenance.”
        </span><verse>54</verse><span>And also unto the third, saying, “I will visit you;”
        </span><verse>55</verse><span>and unto the fourth, and so on unto the twelfth.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>56</verse><span>And the lord of the field went unto the first in the first hour, and tarried
        with him all that hour, and he was made glad with the light of the countenance
        of his lord.
        </span><verse>57</verse><span>And then he withdrew from the first that he might visit the second also,
        and the third, and the
        fourth, and so on unto the twelfth.
        </span><verse>58</verse><span>And thus they all received the light of the
        countenance of their lord, every man in his hour, and in his time, and
        in his season—
        </span><verse>59</verse><span>beginning at the first, and so on unto the last, and from the last unto
        the first, and from the first unto the last;
        </span><verse>60</verse><span>every man in his own order, until his hour was finished, even
        according as his lord had commanded him, that his lord might be glorified
        in him, and he in his lord, that they all might be glorified.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>61</verse><span>Therefore, unto this parable I will liken all these kingdoms, and the
        inhabitants thereof— every kingdom in its hour, and in its time, and in
        its season, even according to the decree which God hath made.

        </span><verse>63</verse><span>draw near unto me and I will draw near unto you; seek me diligently and
        ye shall find me; ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened

        </span><verse>64</verse><span>Whatsoever ye ask the Father in my name it shall be given unto you, that
        is expedient for you;

        it shall abound.
        </span><verse>67</verse><span>And if your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled
        with light, and there shall be no
        darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light comprehendeth
        all things.
        </span><verse>68</verse><span>Therefore, sanctify yourselves that your minds become single to God, and
        the days will come that you shall see him; for he will unveil his face

        call a solemn assembly, even of those who are the first laborers in this

        </span><verse>73</verse><span>Behold, I will hasten my work in its time.
        </span><verse>74</verse><span>And I give unto you, who are the first laborers in this last kingdom,
        a commandment that you assemble yourselves together, and organize
        yourselves, and prepare yourselves, and sanctify yourselves; yea, purify
        your hearts, and cleanse your hands and your feet before me, that I may
        make you clean;
        </span><verse>75</verse><span>that I may
        testify unto your Father, and your God, and my God, that you are clean

        </span><verse>77</verse><span>And I give unto you a commandment that you shall teach one another the
        doctrine of the kingdom.
        </span><verse>78</verse><span>Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed
        more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the

        for you to
        understand;
        </span><verse>79</verse><span>of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things
        which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass;
        things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities
        of the nations, and the
        judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and
        of kingdoms—
        </span><verse>80</verse><span>that ye may be prepared in all things when I shall send you again to magnify
        the calling whereunto I have called you, and the mission with which I have
        commissioned you.

        </span><verse>83</verse><span>He that seeketh me early shall find me, and shall not be forsaken.
        </span><verse>84</verse><span>Therefore, tarry ye, and labor diligently, that you may be perfected in
        your ministry to go forth among the Gentiles for the last time, as many
        as the mouth of the
        Lord shall name, to bind up the law and seal up the testimony, and to
        prepare the saints for the hour of judgment which is to come;
        </span><verse>85</verse><span>that their souls may escape the wrath of God, the desolation of abomination
        which awaits the wicked, both in this world and in the world to come.

        Verily, I say unto you, let those who are not the first elders continue

                D&amp;C 88:81 said “I sent you out to testify and warn the people, and it becomes every man who has
                been warned to warn his neighbor.” Just a few days later, Joseph wrote this letter to Noah Saxton,
                editor of the American Revivalist, and Rochester Observer, which proclaimed that it was “DEDICATED
                TO THE INTERESTS OF ZION GENERALLY, AND ESPECIALLY TO REVIVALS OF RELIGION.” In February
                1833, Joseph wrote another letter to Saxton, complaining that the editor had published only a portion
                of the original letter. Joseph warned him to publish the entire letter, but Saxton did not.

        Considering the liberal principles upon which your interesting and valuable
        paper is published and myself being a subscriber and feeling a deep interest
        in the cause of Zion and in the happiness of my brethren of mankind, I
        cheerfully take up my pen to
        contribute my mite at this very interesting and important period.

        For some length of time I have been carefully viewing the state of things
        as now appear throughout our Christian land, and have looked at it with
        feelings of the most painful anxiety. While upon the one hand beholding
        the manifest withdrawal of God’s Holy
        Spirit and the veil of stupidity which seems to be drawn over the hearts
        of the people, and upon the other hand beholding the judgments of God that
        have swept and are still
        sweeping hundreds and thousands of our race (and I fear unprepared) down
        to the shades of death. With this solemn and alarming fact before me I
        am led to exclaim
        </span><quote>
            <reference>
                <referencenote><span>Jeremiah 9:1</span></referencenote><span>“O that my head were waters and mine eyes a fountain

    <block><span>
        I think that it is high time for a Christian world to awake out of sleep
        and cry mightily to that God day and night whose anger we have justly incurred.
        Are not these things a
        sufficient stimulant to arouse the faculties and call forth the energies
        of every man, woman, and child that possesses feeling of sympathy for his
        fellows, or that is in any degree endeared to the budding cause of our
        glorious Lord. I leave an intelligent community to answer this important
        question with a confession that this is what has
        caused me to overlook my own inability and expose my weakness to a learned
        world. But trusting in that God who has said these things are hid from
        the wise and prudent and
        revealed unto babes, I step forth into the field to tell you what the
        Lord is doing and what you must do to enjoy the smiles of your Savior in
        these last days.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        The time has at last arrived when the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of
        Jacob, has set his hand again the second time to recover the remnants of
        his people which have been left
        from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, etc., and from the islands
        of the sea, and with them to bring in the fulness of the Gentiles and establish
        that covenant with them
        which was promised when their sins should be taken away (see Romans 11:25
        27 and also Jeremiah 31:31
        32 and 33:11).
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        This covenant has never been established with the house of Israel nor
        with the house of
        Judah for it requires two parties to make a covenant, and those two parties
        must be agreed or no covenant can be made. Christ in the days of his flesh
        proposed to make a covenant with them but they rejected him and his proposals,
        and in consequence thereof they were broken off and no covenant was made
        with them at that time. But their unbelief has not
        rendered the promise of God of none effect; no, for there was another
        day limited in David which was the day of his power. And then his people
        Israel should be a willing
        people and he would write his laws in their hearts and print them in their
        thoughts. Their sins and their iniquities he would remember no more.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Thus after this chosen family had rejected Christ and his proposals, the
        heralds of salvation said to them, “Lo we turn unto the Gentiles,
        and the Gentiles received the covenant and were grafted in from whence
        the chosen family were broken off. But the Gentiles have not continued
        in the goodness of God but have departed from the faith that was once
        delivered to the saints and have broken the covenant in which their fathers
        were
        established (see Isaiah 24:5), and have become high minded and have not
        feared therefore but few of them will be gathered with the chosen family.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Has not the pride, high-mindedness, and unbelief of the Gentiles provoked
        the Holy One of Israel to withdraw his Holy Spirit from them and send forth
        his judgments to scourge them for their wickedness? This is certainly the
        case. Christ said to his disciples Mark 16:17–18 that, “these signs should
        follow them that believe; in my name shall they cast
        out devils, they shall speak with new tongues, they shall take up serpents,
        and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them, they shall lay
        hands on the sick and they shall
        recover.” And also in connection with this read 1 Corinthians 12. By the
        foregoing testimonies or through the glass of the foregoing testimonies
        we may look at the Christian world and see the apostacy there has been
        from the Apostolic platform, and who can look at this, and certainly not
        exclaim in the language of Isaiah,
        </span><quote>

                thereof because they have transgressed the Laws; changed the ordinances

        The plain fact is this, the power of God begins to fall upon the nations,
        and the light of the latter day glory begins to break forth through the
        dark atmosphere of sectarian wickedness and their iniquity rolls up into
        view. And the nations of the Gentiles are like the waves of the sea casting
        up mire and dirt or all in commotion. And they hastily are preparing to
        act the part allotted them when the Lord rebukes the nations, when he shall
        rule them with a rod of iron and break them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.
        The Lord has declared to his</span><note><span>D&amp;C 63:32</span></note>
        <note><span>The same newspaper issue that published this letter contained a report from the Cumberland Conference in Maine, which maintained that they had experienced little growth in 1832, stating, “No admissions to this church the past year;” “This church has increased but little in number the last year;” and, “Religion is low.”</span></note><span>
        servants some eighteen months since that he was then withdrawing his spirit
        from the earth, and we can see that such is the fact for not only the churches
        are dwindling away, but there are no conversions, or but very few. And
        this is not all, the governments of the earth are thrown into confusion
        and division, and destruction to the eye of the spiritual beholder seems
        to be written by the finger of an invisible hand in large capitals upon
        almost everything we behold.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        And now what remains to be done under circumstances like these? I will
        proceed to tell you what the Lord requires of all people high and low,
        rich and poor, male and female, ministers and people, professors of religion
        and nonprofessors, in order that they may enjoy the Holy Spirit of God
        to a fulness, and escape the judgments of God which are
        almost ready to burst upon the nations of the earth. Repent of all your
        sins and be baptized in water for the remission of them, in the name of
        the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, and receive the ordinance
        of the laying on of the hands of him who is
        ordained and sealed unto this power, that ye may receive the Holy Spirit
        of God. And this according to the holy scriptures, and of the
        Book of Mormon,
        and the only way that man can enter into the celestial kingdom. These are the
        requisitions of the new covenant or first principles of no professors the gospel of Christ;
        then add to your faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and to knowledge
        temperance, and to temperance patience, and to patience brotherly kindness,
        and to brotherly kindness charity (or love). And if these things be in
        you and abound, they make you to be neither baren nor unfruitful in the
        knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.

        The
        Book of Mormon
        is a record of the forefathers of our western tribes of Indians, having
        been found through the ministration of an holy angel, translated into our
        own language by the gift and power of God, after having been hid up in
        the earth for the last fourteen hundred years, containing the word of God,
        which was delivered unto them. By it we learn that our western tribes of
        Indians are descendants from that Joseph that was
        sold into Egypt, and that the land of America is a promised land unto
        them, and unto it all the tribes of Israel will come. with as many of the
        gentiles as shall comply with the
        requisitions of the new covenant, but the tribe of Judah will return to
        old Jerusalem. The city of Zion, spoken of by David in the 102 Psalm, will
        be built upon the land of America and the ransomed of the Lord shall return
        and come to it with songs and everlasting joy
        upon their heads, and then they will be delivered from the overflowing
        scourge that shall pass through the land. But Judah shall obtain deliverance
        at Jerusalem (see Joel 2:32, Isaiah 26:20–21, Jeremiah 31:12, Psalm 50:5,
        Ezekiel 34:11–13). These are testimonies that the good Shepherd will put
        forth his own sheep and lead them out from all nations where they have
        been scattered in a cloudy and dark day, to Zion and to Jerusalem, beside
        many more testimonies which might be brought.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        And now I am prepared to say by the authority of Jesus Christ, that not
        many years shall pass away before the United States shall present such
        a scene of bloodshed as has not a parallel in the history of our nation.
        Pestilence, hail, famine, and earthquake will sweep the wicked of this
        generation from off the face of this land, to open and prepare the way
        for the return of the lost tribes of Israel from the north country. The
        people of the Lord, those who have complied with the requisitions of the
        new covenant, have already commenced gathering together to Zion, which
        is in the State of Missouri. Therefore, I declare unto you the warning
        which the Lord has commanded me to declare unto this generation, remembering
        that the eyes of my maker are upon me and that to him I am accountable
        for every word I say, wishing nothing worse to my fellow men than their
        eternal salvation. Therefore, fear God and give glory to him, for the
        hour of his judgment is come. Repent ye, repent ye, and embrace the everlasting
        covenant and flee to Zion before the overflowing scourge overtakes you.
        For there are those now living upon the earth whose eyes shall not be closed
        in death until they see all these things which I have spoken fulfilled.
        Remember these things, call upon the Lord while he is near and seek him
        while he may be found, is the exhortation of your unworthy servant.

                Hyde, Ezra Thayer, Levi Hancock, and William Smith assembled in conference. The previous day had
                been a conference during which several members spoke in tongues and there were other divine
                manifestations of the Holy Spirit.

                HC: On the 23rd of January, we again assembled in conference; when, after much speaking, singing,
                praying, and praising God, all in tongues, we proceeded to the washing of feet (according to the
                practice recorded in the 13th chapter of John’s Gospel), as commanded of the Lord. Each Elder washed
                his own feet first, after which I girded myself with a towel and washed the feet of all of them, wiping
                them with the towel with which I was girded…I then said to the Elders, “As I have done so do ye; wash
                ye, therefore, one another’s feet;” and by the power of the Holy Ghost I pronounced them all clean
                from the blood of this generation; but if any of them should sin willfully after they were thus cleansed,
                and sealed up unto eternal life, they should be given over unto the buffetings of Satan until the day of
                redemption. Having continued all day in fasting, and prayer, and ordinances, we closed by partaking of
                the Lord’s supper. I blessed the bread and wine in the name of the Lord, when we all ate and drank,
                and were filled; then we sang a hymn, and the meeting adjourned.

                HC: Great joy and satisfaction continually beamed in the countenances of the School of the Prophets,
                and the Saints, on account of the things revealed, and our progress in the knowledge of God. The High
                Priests assembled in the school room of the Prophets, and were organized according to revelation;
                prayer by Sidney Rigdon.
            </span></block>

            <block><span>
                "Doctor" Hurlburt was ordained an Elder; after which Elder Rigdon expressed a desire that himself and
                Brother Frederick G. Williams should be ordained to the offices to which they had been called, viz.,
                those of Presidents of the High Priesthood, and to be equal in holding the keys of the kingdom with
                Brother Joseph Smith, Jun., according to the revelation given on the 8th of March, 1833. Accordingly I
                laid my hands on Brothers Sidney and Frederick, and ordained them to take part with me in holding the
                keys of this last kingdom, and to assist in the Presidency of the High Priesthood, as my Counselors;
                after which I exhorted the brethren to faithfulness and diligence in keeping the commandments of
                God, and gave much instruction for the benefit of the Saints, with a promise that the pure in heart
                should see a heavenly vision; and after remaining a short time in secret prayer, the promise was
                verified; for many present had the eyes of their understanding opened by the Spirit of God, so as to
                behold many things. I then blessed the bread and wine, and distributed a portion to each. Many of the
                brethren saw a heavenly vision of the Savior, and concourses of angels, and many other things, of
                which each one has a record of what he saw.

            <block><span>
                I saw his glory, that he was in the beginning, before the world was;

                </span><verse>9</verse><span>the light and the Redeemer of the world; the Spirit of truth, who came
                into the world, because the world was made by him, and in him was the life

                received grace for grace;

                to grace, until he received a fulness;

        they are to
        come;
        </span><verse>25</verse><span>and whatsoever is more or less than this is the spirit of that wicked
        one who was a liar from the beginning.
        </span><verse>26</verse><span>The Spirit of truth is of God. I am the Spirit of truth, and John bore
        record of me, saying, “He received a fulness of truth, yea, even of all
        truth;”
        </span><verse>27</verse><span>and no man receives a fulness unless he keepeth his commandments.
        </span><verse>28</verse><span>He that keepeth his

        <verse>29</verse><span>Man was also in the beginning with God. Intelligence, or the light of

        created or made, neither indeed can be.
        </span><verse>30</verse><span>All truth is independent in that sphere in which God has placed it, to
        act for itself, as all intelligence also; otherwise there is no existence.

        <verse>31</verse><span>Behold, here is the agency of man, and here is the condemnation of man;
        because that which was from the beginning is plainly manifest unto them,
        and they receive not the light.
        </span><verse>32</verse><span>And every man whose spirit receiveth not the light is under condemnation.

        <verse>33</verse><span>For man is spirit. The elements are eternal, and spirit and element, inseparably
        connected, receive a fulness of joy;
        </span><verse>34</verse><span>and when separated, man cannot receive a fulness of joy.
        </span><verse>35</verse><span>The elements are the tabernacle of God; yea, man is the tabernacle of
        God, even temples; and whatsoever temple is defiled, God shall destroy
        that temple.

        <verse>36</verse><span>The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth.
        </span><verse>37</verse><span>Light and truth forsake that evil one.
        </span><verse>38</verse><span>Every spirit of man was innocent in the beginning; and God having redeemed
        man from the fall, men became again, in their infant state, innocent before
        God.
        </span><verse>39</verse><span>And that wicked one cometh and taketh away light and truth, through disobedience,
        from the children of men, and because of the tradition of their fathers.
        </span><verse>40</verse><span>But I have commanded you to bring up your children in light and truth.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>41</verse><span>But verily I say unto you, my servant Frederick G. Williams, you have
        continued under this condemnation;
        </span><verse>42</verse><span>you have not taught your children light and truth, according to the commandments;
        and that wicked one hath power, as yet, over you, and this is the cause
        of your affliction.
        </span><verse>43</verse><span>And now a commandment I give unto you—if you will be delivered you shall
        set in order your own house, for there are many things that are not right
        in your house.

    <block>
        <verse>44</verse><span>Verily, I say unto my servant Sidney Rigdon, that in some things he has

        </span><verse>46</verse><span>I called you servants for the world’s sake, and ye are their servants
        for my sake—
        </span><verse>47</verse><span>and now, verily I say unto Joseph Smith, Jun.—You have not kept the commandments,
        and must needs stand
        rebuked before the Lord;
        </span><verse>48</verse><span>your family must needs repent and forsake some things, and give more earnest
        heed unto your sayings, or be removed out of their place.
        </span><verse>49</verse><span>What I say unto one I say unto all; pray always lest that wicked one have
        power in you, and remove you out of your place.

    <block>
        <verse>50</verse><span>My servant Newel K. Whitney also, a bishop of my church, hath need to

                HC: Great preparations were making to commence a house of the Lord; and notwithstanding the
                Church was poor, yet our unity, harmony and charity abounded to strengthen us to do the
                commandments of God. The building of the house of the Lord in Kirtland was a matter that continued
                to increase in its interest in the hearts of the brethren, and the building committee issued the following
                circular to the different branches of the Church:
            </span></block>

            <block><span>To the Church of Christ in —</span></block>

            <block><span>
                We feel under obligations to write to you as well as to all the brethren of the different branches; and
                we do this, that you, with us, may exert yourselves to bring about the fulfilment of the command of the
                Lord concerning the establishing, or preparing a house, wherein the Elders who have been commanded
                of the Lord so to do, may gather themselves together, and prepare all things, and call a solemn
                assembly, and treasure up words of wisdom, that they may go forth to the Gentiles for the last time;
                and now, in order to accomplish this, we are directed, yea, we are under the necessity, to call upon the
                whole Church as a body, that they make every possible exertion to aid temporally, as well as spiritually,
                in this great work that the Lord is beginning, and is about to accomplish. And unless we fulfil this
                command, viz: establish an house, and prepare all things necessary whereby the elders may gather into
                a school, called the School of the Prophets, and receive that instruction which the Lord designs they
                should receive, we may all despair of obtaining the great blessing that God has promised to the faithful
                of the Church of Christ; therefore it is as important, as our salvation, that we obey this above mentioned command, as well as all the commandments of the Lord.
            </span></block>

            <block><span>
                Therefore, brethren, we write this epistle to you, to stir up your minds to make that exertion which the
                Lord requires of you, to lend a temporal aid in these things above written…Our Heavenly Father is
                opening the hearts of our brethren beyond the expectation of many; and not one brother among us, as
                yet, refuses to exert himself to do something in a temporal way to bring about the establishing of this
                house and school; and we say, may our Heavenly Father open your hearts also, that you, with us, may
                gather together something to aid as a temporal benefit…May the Lord help you to exert yourselves
                with us, in raising the means to bring about the glorious work of the Lord; and may we all be kept by
                the grace of God unto eternal life.</span><break></break><span>Amen.

    <block>
        <verse>1</verse><span>Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you whom I love, and whom I love I also
        chasten that their sins may be forgiven, for with the chastisement I prepare
        a way for their deliverance in all things out of temptation, and I have
        loved you—
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>wherefore, ye must needs be
        chastened and stand rebuked before my face;
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>for ye have sinned against me a very
        grievous sin, in that ye have not considered the great commandment in
        all things, that I have given unto you concerning the building of mine
        house;
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>for the preparation
        wherewith I design to prepare mine apostles to prune my vineyard for the
        last time, that I may bring to pass my strange act, that I may pour out
        my Spirit upon all flesh—
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>but behold, verily I say unto you, that there are many who have been ordained
        among you,
        whom I have called but few of them are chosen.
        </span><verse>6</verse><span>They who are not chosen have sinned a very grievous sin, in that they
        are walking in darkness at noon-day.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>7</verse><span>And for this cause I gave unto you a commandment that you should call
        your solemn assembly, that your fastings and your mourning might come up
        into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth, which is by interpretation, the creator
        of the first day, the beginning and the end.
        </span><verse>8</verse><span>Yea, verily I say unto you, I gave unto you a commandment that you should
        build a house, in the which house I design to endow those whom I have chosen
        with power from on high;
        </span><verse>9</verse><span>for this is the promise of the Father unto you; therefore I command you
        to tarry, even as mine apostles at Jerusalem.
        </span><verse>10</verse><span>Nevertheless, my servants sinned a very grievous sin; and contentions
        arose in the school of the prophets; which was very grievous unto me, says
        your Lord; therefore I sent them forth to be chastened.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>11</verse><span>Verily I say unto you, it is my will that you should build a house. If
        you keep my commandments you shall have power to build it.
        </span><verse>12</verse><span>If you keep not my commandments, the love of the Father shall not continue
        with you, therefore you shall walk in darkness.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>13</verse><span>Now here is wisdom, and the mind of the Lord—let the house be built, not
        after the manner of the world, for I give not unto you that ye shall live
        after the manner of the world;
        </span><verse>14</verse><span>therefore, let it be built after the manner which I shall show unto three
        of you,
        whom ye shall appoint and ordain unto this power.
        </span><verse>15</verse><span>And the size thereof shall be fifty and five feet in width, and let it
        be sixty-five feet in length, in the inner court thereof.
        </span><verse>16</verse><span>And
        let the lower part of the inner court be dedicated unto me for your sacrament
        offering, and for your preaching, and your fasting, and your praying, and
        the offering up of your most holy desires unto me, says your Lord.
        </span><verse>17</verse><span>And let the higher part of the inner court be dedicated unto me for the
        school of mine apostles, says Son Ahman; or, in other words, Alphus; or,
        in other words, Omegus; even Jesus Christ your Lord.</span><break></break><span>Amen.

                HC: A similar conference assembled at the same place and took into consideration how the French
                farm should be disposed of. The conference could not agree who should take charge of it, but all

        </span><verse>2</verse><span>Therefore, let my servant Newel K. Whitney take charge of the place which

        is necessary to benefit mine order, for the purpose of bringing forth my
        word to the children of men.
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>For behold, verily I say unto you, this is the most expedient in me, that
        my word should go forth unto the children of men, for the purpose of subduing

                In accordance with D&amp;C 88, members of the Church of Christ in Jackson County, Missouri, organized a
                local version school of the prophets in summer 1833 called the School in Zion. It met weekly and had
                about sixty students. By early July 1833, they desired to know God’s will concerning the school and
                sent two letters to Joseph. In response, the presidency of the high priesthood wrote a letter to
                Missouri leaders on August 6 that included this revelation, which they referred to as “the
                communication which we received from the Lord concerning the school in Zion.”

        <verse>1</verse><span>Verily I say unto you my friends, I speak unto you with my voice, even
        the voice of my Spirit, that I may show unto you my will concerning your
        brethren in the land of Zion, many of whom are truly humble and are seeking
        diligently to learn wisdom and to find
        truth.
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>Verily, verily I say unto you, blessed are such, for they shall obtain;
        for I, the Lord, show mercy unto all the meek, and upon all whomsoever
        I will, that I may be justified
        when I shall bring them unto judgment.

        <verse>3</verse><span>Behold, I say unto you, concerning the school in Zion, I, the Lord, am
        well pleased that there should be a school in Zion, and also with my servant
        Parley P. Pratt, for he abideth in me.
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>And inasmuch as he continueth to abide in me he shall continue to preside
        over the school in the land of Zion until I shall give unto him other commandments.
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>And I will bless him with a multiplicity of blessings, in expounding all
        scriptures and mysteries to the edification of the school, and of the church
        in Zion.

    <block>
        <verse>6</verse><span>And to the residue of the school, I, the Lord, am willing to show mercy;
        nevertheless, there are those that must needs be chastened, and their works
        shall be made known.
        </span><verse>7</verse><span>The ax is laid at the root of the trees; and every tree that bringeth
        not forth good fruit shall be hewn down and cast into the fire. I, the
        Lord, have spoken it.

        <verse>8</verse><span>Verily I say unto you, all among them who know their hearts are honest,
        and are broken, and their spirits contrite, and are willing to observe
        their covenants by sacrifice—yea,
        every sacrifice which I, the Lord, shall command—they are accepted of
        me.
        </span><verse>9</verse><span>For I, the Lord, will cause them to bring forth as a very fruitful tree
        which is planted in a goodly land, by a pure stream, that yields much precious
        fruit.

        <verse>10</verse><span>Verily I say unto you, that it is my will that a house should be built
        unto me in the land of Zion, like unto the pattern which I have given you.
        </span><verse>11</verse><span>Yea, let it be built speedily, by the tithing of my people.
        </span><verse>12</verse><span>Behold, this is the tithing and the sacrifice which I, the Lord,
        require at their hands, that there may be a house built unto me for the
        salvation of Zion—
        </span><verse>13</verse><span>for a place of thanksgiving for all saints, and for a place of instruction
        for all those who are called to the work of the ministry in all their several
        callings and offices;
        </span><verse>14</verse><span>that they may be perfected in the understanding of their ministry, in
        theory, in principle, and in
        doctrine, in all things pertaining to the kingdom of God on the earth,
        the keys of which kingdom have been conferred upon you.

        <verse>15</verse><span>And inasmuch as my people build a house unto me in the name of the Lord,
        and do not suffer any unclean thing to come into it, that it be not defiled,
        my glory shall rest upon it;
        </span><verse>16</verse><span>yea, and my presence shall be there, for I will come into it, and all
        the pure in heart that shall come into it shall see God.
        </span><verse>17</verse><span>But if it be defiled I will not come into it, and my glory shall not be
        there; for I will not come into unholy temples.

        <verse>18</verse><span>And, now, behold, if Zion do these things she shall prosper, and spread

                By summer 1833, church leaders planned for and began construction on a House of the Lord in
                Kirtland, which was to serve as both a chapel and a schoolhouse. The presidency of the high priesthood
                was assigned to create a design for the interior of the building. Three weeks later they sent to Missouri
                church leaders the architectural plans for another House of the Lord, similar in style and purpose, to be
                built in Independence, Missouri.
            </span></block>

            <block><span>
                Four days after Joseph dictated this revelation, the presidency copied it into a letter they sent to
                Missouri, which stated this revelation “is also binding on you, that is you at Zion have to build two
                houses as well as the one of which we have sent the pattern.” In other words, the Missouri church members should build three buildings in Independence: the House of the Lord, an administrative house
                for church business, and one for their printing establishment.
            </span></block>

                Daniel 9:24–25 prophecies about a 69 week period of time after the command to build Jerusalem is
                given and a 70 week period of time to make reconciliation for iniquity. 69 weeks after August 2, 1833
                was November 29, 1834, when Joseph and Oliver entered into a covenant of tithing for the
                continuation of blessings. 70 weeks after that was April 3, 1836, when the Messiah appeared to Joseph
                and Oliver in Kirtland.

                Tensions in Missouri had been increasing, and though Joseph didn’t know it yet, the church printing
                office in Independence had been destroyed. Less than two weeks after this revelation was received,
                Joseph wrote that “We are no safer here in Kirtland then you are in Zion, the cloud is gathering around
                us with great fury and all pharaoh’s host or in other words all hell and the combined powers of Earth

        befriending that law which is the constitutional law of the land;
        </span><verse>7</verse><span>and as pertaining to law of man, whatsoever is more or less than this,
        cometh of evil.
        </span><verse>8</verse><span>I, the Lord God, make you free, therefore ye are free indeed; and the

        your family, even your children’s children unto the third and fourth generation.
        </span><verse>29</verse><span>And then, if he shall come upon you or your
        children, or your children’s children unto the third and fourth generation,
        I have delivered thine enemy into thine hands;
        </span><verse>30</verse><span>and then if thou wilt spare him, thou shalt be rewarded for thy righteousness;
        and also thy children and thy children’s children unto the third and fourth
        generation.
        </span><verse>31</verse><span>Nevertheless, thine enemy is in thine hands; and if thou rewardest him
        according to his works thou art justified; if he has sought thy life, and
        thy life is
        endangered by him, thine enemy is in thine hands and thou art justified.

        well; they are in mine hands, and I will do with them as seemeth me good;
        for in me there is all power.

        </span><verse>4</verse><span>Therefore, I, the Lord, have suffered you to come unto this place; for
        thus it was expedient in me for the salvation of souls.
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>Therefore, verily I say unto you, lift up your voices unto this people;
        speak the thoughts that I shall put into your hearts, and you shall not
        be confounded before men;
        </span><verse>6</verse><span>for it shall be given you in the very hour, yea, in the very moment, what
        ye shall say.
        </span><verse>7</verse><span>But a commandment I give unto you, that ye shall declare whatsoever thing
        ye declare in my name, in solemnity of heart, in the spirit of meekness,
        in all things.
        </span><verse>8</verse><span>And I give unto you this promise, that inasmuch as ye do this the Holy

        <verse>9</verse><span>And it is expedient in me that you, my servant Sidney, should be a spokesman

        to be a spokesman unto my servant Joseph.
        </span><verse>10</verse><span>And I will give unto him power to be mighty in testimony.
        </span><verse>11</verse><span>And I will give unto thee power to be mighty in expounding all scriptures,
        that thou mayest be a spokesman unto him, and he shall be a revelator unto
        thee, that thou mayest know the
        certainty of all things pertaining to the things of my kingdom on the

        <verse>13</verse><span>And now I give unto you a word concerning Zion. Zion shall be redeemed,

        </span><verse>14</verse><span>Thy brethren, my servants Orson Hyde and John Gould, are in my hands;
        and inasmuch as they keep my commandments they shall be saved.
        </span><verse>15</verse><span>Therefore, let your hearts be comforted; for all things shall work together
        for good to them that walk uprightly, and to the sanctification of the

                Joseph received two letters detailing the problems the members in Missouri were facing. This letter
                was his response.

        I cannot learn from any communication by the spirit to me that Zion has
        forfeited her claim to a celestial crown notwithstanding the Lord has caused
        her to be thus afflicted;
        except it may be some individuals who have walked in disobedience and
        forsaken the new covenants; all such will be made manifest by their works
        in due time. I have always
        expected that Zion would suffer sore affliction. From what I could learn
        from the commandments which have been given but I would remind you of a
        certain clause in one which says that after much tribulation cometh the
        blessing. By this and also others, and also one received of late, I know
        that Zion, in the own due time of the Lord will be
        redeemed, but how many will be the days of her purification, tribulation
        and affliction, the Lord has kept hid from my eyes; and when I enquire
        concerning this subject the voice of the Lord is:
        </span><quote><span>
            Be still, and know that I am God! All those who suffer for my name shall
            reign with me, and he that layeth down his life for my sake shall find
            it again.
        </span></quote>
    </block>

    <block><span>
        Now there are two things of which I am ignorant and the Lord will not
        show me— perhaps for a wise purpose in himself. I mean in some respects,
        and they are these:
        </span><dot><span>
            Why God hath suffered so great calamity to come upon Zion; or what the
            great moving cause of this great affliction is.
        </span></dot>
        <dot><span>
            And again, by what means he will return her back to her inheritance with
            songs of everlasting joy upon her head.
        </span></dot>
    </block>

    <block><span>
        These two things brethren, are in part kept back that they are not plainly
        shewn unto me. But there are some things that are plainly manifest, that
        has incurred the displeasure of the Almighty. When I contemplate upon all
        things that have been manifested, I am sensible that I ought not to murmur
        and do not murmur, only in this: that those who are innocent are compelled
        to suffer for the iniquities of the guilty. And I cannot account for this,
        only on this wise, that the saying of the Savior has not been strictly
        observed,

        Now the fact is, if any of the members of our body are disordered, the
        rest of our body will be effected with them and then all is brought into
        bondage together. And yet notwithstanding all this, it is with difficulty
        that I can restrain my feelings; when I know that you my brethren with
        whom I have had so many happy hours, sitting as it were in heavenly places
        in Christ Jesus, and also having the witness which I feel, and even have
        felt, of the purity of your motives—are cast out, and are as strangers
        and pilgrims on the earth, exposed to hunger, cold, nakedness peril, sword,
        etc. I say when I contemplate this, it is with difficulty that I can keep
        from complaining and murmurings against this
        dispensation; but I am sensible that this is not right and may God grant
        that notwithstanding your great afflictions and sufferings there may not
        anything separate us from the love of Christ.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Brethren, when we learn your sufferings it awakens every sympathy of our
        hearts; it
        weighs us down; we cannot refrain from tears [illegible] yet we are not
        able to realize only in part your sufferings. And I often hear the brethren
        saying they wish they were with you that they might bear a part of your
        sufferings; and I myself should have been with you had not God prevented
        it in the order of his providence, that the yoke of affliction might be
        less grievous upon you; God having forewarned me concerning these things
        for your sakes; and also brother Oliver Cowdery could not lighten your
        afflictions by tarrying longer
        with you, for his presence would have so much the more enraged your enemies;
        therefore, God hath deals dealt mercifully with us.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        O brethren, let us be thankful that it is as well with us as it is, and
        we are yet alive that
        peradventure, God hath laid up in store great good for us in this generation,
        and grant that we may yet glorify his name. I feel thankful that there
        have no more denied the faith. I
        pray God, in the name of Jesus, that you all may be kept in the faith
        unto the end. Let your sufferings be what they may, it is better that you
        should die in the eyes of God than that you should give up the land of
        Zion, the inheritances which you have purchased with your monies. For every
        man that giveth not up his inheritances though he should die yet, when
        the Lord shall come he shall stand upon it and with Job in his flesh he
        shall see God.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Therefore this is my council that you retain your lands even unto the
        uttermost, and seeking every lawful means to obtain redress of your enemies,
        etc., and pray to God day
        and night to return you in peace and in safety to the Lands of your inheritance,
        and when the Judge fails you, appeal unto the Executive, and when the Executive
        fails you, appeal unto the President, and when the President fails you,
        and all laws fail you and the
        humanity of the people fails you, and all things else fails you but God
        alone, and you continue to weary him with your importunings, as the poor
        woman the unjust Judge, he will not fail to execute judgment upon your
        enemies and to avenge his own elect that cry unto him day and night—Behold
        he will not fail you! He will come with ten thousand of his saints and
        all his adversaries shall be destroyed by the breath of his lips!
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        All those that keep their inheritances notwithstanding they should be
        pealed and driven shall be likened unto the wise virgins who took oil in
        their lamps. But all those who are unbelieving and fearful, will be likened
        unto the foolish virgins, who took no oil in their lamps; and when they
        shall return and say unto the saints, give us of your lands, behold there
        will be no room found for them.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        As respects giving deeds I would advise to give deeds as far as the brethren
        have legal and just claims for them and then let every man answer to God
        for the disposal of them. I would suggest some ideas to Brother William
        P., not knowing as they will be of any real benefit, but suggest them for
        consideration I would be glad that he were here, but dare not advise, were
        it possible for him to come, not knowing what shall befall us, as we are
        under very heavy and serious threatening from a great many people in this
        place. But
        perhaps the people in Liberty may feel willing, God having power to soften
        the hearts of all men, to have a press established there; and if not, in
        some other place; any place where it can be the most convenient and it
        is possible to get to it. God will be willing to have it in any place where
        it can be established in safety. We must be wise as serpents and harmless
        as doves. Again I desire that Brother William would collect all the information,
        and give us a true history of the beginning and rise of Zion and her calamities,
        etc.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Now hear the prayer of your unworthy brother in the bonds of the new and
        everlasting covenant:
        </span><quote>
            <block><span>
                O my God! Thou who has called and chosen a few through thy weak instrument
                by commandment and sent them to Missouri, a place which thou didst call
                Zion and commanded thy servants to consecrate unto thyself for a place
                of a refuge, and of
                safety for the gathering of thy saints, to be built up a holy city unto
                thyself.
            </span></block>

            <block><span>
                And as thou hast said that none other place should be appointed like unto
                this, therefore I ask thee in the name of Jesus Christ:
                </span><dot><span>
                    to return thy people unto their homes and their inheritances, to enjoy
                    the fruit of their labors;
                </span></dot>
                <dot><span>
                    that all the waste places may be built up;
                </span></dot>
                <dot><span>
                    that all the enemies of thy people, who will not return repent and return
                    unto thee be destroyed from off the face of that Land;
                </span></dot>
                <dot><span>
                    and let an house be built and established unto thy name,

                <dot><span>
                    and let all the losses that thy people have sustained be rewarded unto

                </span></dot>
                <dot><span>
                    that the borders of Zion be enlarged forever, and let her be established

                    and let all thy saints when they are scattered as sheep, and are persecuted,
                    and flee unto Zion, and be established in the midst of her, and let her
                    be organized according to thy law.

                And let this prayer even be recorded before thy face. Give thy holy spirit
                unto my
                brethren unto whom I write. Send thy angels to guard them and to deliver
                them from
                all evil. And when they turn their faces towards Zion and bow down before
                thee and pray, may their sins never come up before thy face, neither have
                place in the book of thy remembrance, and may they depart from all their
                iniquities. Provide food for them as thou doest for the ravens, provide
                clothing to cover their nakedness, and houses that they may dwell therein.
                Give unto them friends in abundance, and let their names be recorded in
                the Lamb’s book of life eternally before thy face.</span><break></break><span>Amen

                As details of the violent events in Missouri reached Kirtland, Ohio, in late fall, Joseph sought to
                understand why church members were expelled from Jackson County, what it meant for the gathering
                to Zion, and what church members should do to regain their lands. On December 10, Joseph wrote that
                the Lord was keeping hid from him the answers to those questions. After receiving this revelation,
                Joseph sent it to the church in Missouri in a letter dated January 22, 1834.

        they have been afflicted, in consequence of their

        <verse>6</verse><span>Behold, I say unto you, there were jarrings, and contentions, and envyings,
        and strifes, and lustful and covetous desires among them; therefore by
        these things they polluted their inheritances.
        </span><verse>7</verse><span>They were slow to hearken unto the voice of the Lord their God; therefore,
        the Lord their God is slow to hearken unto their prayers, to answer them
        in the day of their trouble.
        </span><verse>8</verse><span>In the day of their peace they esteemed lightly my counsel; but, in the
        day of their trouble, of necessity they feel after me.

    <block>
        <verse>9</verse><span>Verily I say unto you, notwithstanding their sins, my bowels are filled
        with compassion towards them. I will not utterly cast them off; and in
        the day of wrath I will remember mercy.
        </span><verse>10</verse><span>I have sworn, and the decree has gone forth by a former commandment which
        I have given unto you, that I would let fall the sword of mine indignation
        in behalf of my people; and even as I have said, it shall come to pass.
        </span><verse>11</verse><span>Mine indignation is soon to be
        poured out without measure upon all nations; and this will I do when the
        cup of their iniquity is full.

        <verse>12</verse><span>And in that day all who are found upon the watch-tower, or in other words,

        is in mine hands; be still and know that I am God.

        are scattered.
        </span><verse>18</verse><span>They that remain, and are pure in heart, shall return, and come to their
        inheritances, they and their children, with songs of
        everlasting joy, to build up the waste places of Zion—

        Parable of the vineyard tower
    </span></heading>

    <block>
        <verse>44</verse><span>A certain nobleman had a spot of land, very choice; and he said unto his
        servants:
        </span><quote><span>
            Go ye unto my vineyard, even upon this very choice piece of land, and
            plant twelve olive trees;
            </span><verse>45</verse><span>and set watchmen round about them, and build a tower, that one may overlook
            the land round about, to be a watchman upon the tower, that mine olive
            trees may not be broken down when the enemy shall come to spoil and take
            upon themselves the fruit of my vineyard.
        </span></quote>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>46</verse><span>Now, the servants of the nobleman went and did as their lord commanded
        them, and planted the olive trees, and built a hedge round about, and set
        watchmen, and began to
        build a tower.
        </span><verse>47</verse><span>And while they were yet laying the foundation thereof, they began to say
        among themselves, “And what need hath my lord of this tower?”
        </span><verse>48</verse><span>And consulted for a long time, saying among themselves, “What need hath
        my lord of this tower, seeing this is a time of peace?
        </span><verse>49</verse><span>Might not this money be given to the exchangers? For there is no need
        of these things.”
        </span><verse>50</verse><span>And while they were at variance one with another they became very slothful,
        and they hearkened not unto the commandments of their lord.

    <block>
        <verse>51</verse><span>And the enemy came by night, and broke down the hedge; and the servants
        of the nobleman arose and were affrighted, and fled; and the enemy destroyed
        their works, and broke down the olive trees.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>52</verse><span>Now, behold, the nobleman, the lord of the vineyard, called upon his servants,
        and said unto them:
        </span><quote><span>
            Why! What is the cause of this great evil?
            </span><verse>53</verse><span>Ought ye not to have done even as I commanded you, and—after ye had planted
            the vineyard, and built the hedge round about, and set watchmen upon the
            walls thereof—built the tower also, and set a
            watchman upon the tower, and watched for my vineyard, and not have fallen
            asleep, lest the enemy should come upon you?
            </span><verse>54</verse><span>And behold, the watchman upon the tower would have seen the enemy while
            he was yet afar off; and then ye could have made ready and kept the enemy
            from breaking down the hedge thereof, and saved my
            vineyard from the hands of the destroyer.
        </span></quote>

    <block>
        <verse>55</verse><span>And the lord of the vineyard said unto one of his servants:

            Go and gather together the residue of my servants, and take all the strength
            of mine house, which are my warriors, my young men, and they that are of
            middle age also among all my servants, who are the strength of mine house,
            save those only whom I have appointed to tarry;
            </span><verse>56</verse><span>and go ye straightway unto the land of my vineyard, and
            redeem my vineyard; for it is mine; I have bought it with money.
            </span><verse>57</verse><span>Therefore, get ye straightway unto my land; break down the walls of mine
            enemies; throw down their tower, and scatter their watchmen.
            </span><verse>58</verse><span>And inasmuch as they gather together against you, avenge me of mine enemies,
            that by and by I may come with the residue of mine house and possess the
            land.
        </span></quote>

    <block>
        <verse>59</verse><span>And the servant said unto his lord, “When shall these things be?”
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>60</verse><span>And he said unto his servant:
        </span><quote><span>
            When I will; go ye straightway, and do all things whatsoever I have commanded
            you;
            </span><verse>61</verse><span>and this shall be my seal and blessing upon you—a faithful and wise steward
            in the midst of mine house, a ruler in my kingdom.

    <block>
        <verse>62</verse><span>And his servant went straightway, and did all things whatsoever his lord
        commanded him; and after many days all things were fulfilled.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>63</verse><span>Again, verily I say unto you, I will show unto you wisdom in me concerning
        all the churches, inasmuch as they are willing to be guided in a right
        and proper way for their
        salvation—
        </span><verse>64</verse><span>that the work of the gathering together of my saints may continue, that
        I may build them up unto my name upon holy places; for the time of harvest
        is come, and my word must needs be fulfilled.
        </span><verse>65</verse><span>Therefore, I must gather together my people, according to the parable
        of the wheat and the tares, that the wheat may be secured in the garners
        to possess eternal life, and be crowned with celestial glory, when I shall
        come in the kingdom of my Father to reward every man according as his work
        shall be;
        </span><verse>66</verse><span>while the tares shall be bound in bundles, and their bands made strong,
        that they may be burned with
        unquenchable fire.

    <block>
        <verse>67</verse><span>Therefore, a commandment I give unto all the churches, that they shall
        continue to gather together unto the places which I have appointed.
        </span><verse>68</verse><span>Nevertheless, as I have said unto you in a former commandment, let not
        your gathering be in haste, nor by flight; but let all things be prepared
        before you.
        </span><verse>69</verse><span>And in order that all things be prepared before you,
        observe the commandment which I have given concerning these things—
        </span><verse>70</verse><span>which saith, or teacheth, to purchase all the lands with money, which
        can be purchased for money, in the region round about the land which I
        have appointed to be the land of Zion, for the beginning of the gathering
        of my saints;
        </span><verse>71</verse><span>all the land which can be purchased in Jackson county, and the counties
        round about, and leave the residue in mine hand.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>72</verse><span>Now, verily I say unto you, let all the churches gather together all their
        moneys; let these things be done in their time, but not in haste; and observe
        to have all things prepared before you.
        </span><verse>73</verse><span>And let honorable men be appointed, even wise men, and send them to
        purchase these lands.
        </span><verse>74</verse><span>And the churches in the eastern countries, when they are built up, if
        they will hearken unto this counsel they may buy lands and gather together
        upon them; and in this way they may establish Zion.
        </span><verse>75</verse><span>There is even now already in store sufficient,
        yea, even an abundance, to redeem Zion, and establish her waste places,
        no more to be thrown down, were the churches, who call themselves after
        my name, willing to hearken to my voice.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>76</verse><span>And again I say unto you, those who have been scattered by their enemies,
        it is my will that they should continue to importune for redress, and redemption,
        by the hands of those who are placed as rulers and are in authority over
        you—
        </span><verse>77</verse><span>according to the laws and constitution of the people, which I have suffered
        to be established, and should be maintained for the rights and protection
        of all flesh, according to just and holy principles;
        </span><verse>78</verse><span>that every man may act in doctrine and principle pertaining to futurity,
        according to the moral agency which I have given unto him, that every man
        may be accountable for his own sins in the day of judgment.
        </span><verse>79</verse><span>Therefore, it is not right that any man should be in bondage one to another.
        </span><verse>80</verse><span>And for this purpose have I established the Constitution of this land,
        by the hands of wise men whom I raised up unto this very purpose, and redeemed
        the land by the shedding of blood.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>81</verse><span>Now, unto what shall I liken the children of Zion? I will liken them unto
        the parable of the woman and the unjust judge, for men ought always to
        pray and not to faint, which saith—
    </span></block>

    <heading><span>
        Parable of the woman and the unjust judge
    </span></heading>

    <block>
        <verse>82</verse><span>There was in a city a judge which feared not God, neither regarded man.
        </span><verse>83</verse><span>And there was a widow in that city, and she came unto him, saying, “Avenge
        me of mine adversary.”
        </span><verse>84</verse><span>And he would not for a while, but afterward he said within himself,
        “Though I fear not God, nor regard man, yet because this widow troubleth
        me I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.”
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>85</verse><span>Thus will I liken the children of Zion.
        </span><verse>86</verse><span>Let them importune at the feet of the judge;
        </span><verse>87</verse><span>and if he heed them not, let them importune at the feet of the governor;
        </span><verse>88</verse><span>and if the
        governor heed them not, let them importune at the feet of the president;
        </span><verse>89</verse><span>and if the

        his hiding place, and in his fury vex the nation;
        </span><verse>90</verse><span>and in his hot displeasure, and in his fierce anger, in his time, will
        cut off those wicked, unfaithful, and unjust stewards, and appoint them
        their portion among hypocrites, and unbelievers;

        of teeth.

                On February 17, 1834, at a meeting in Kirtland that included priesthood holders and other members of
                the church, Joseph oversaw the initial organization of a standing “Presidents Church Council”. Orson Hyde noted in the minutes of that meeting that “many questions have been asked during the time of
                the organization of this Council and doubtless some errors have been committed, it was, therefore,
                voted by all present that Brother Joseph should make all necessary corrections by the spirit of
                inspiration hereafter.” Joseph worked on amending the minutes the following day and presented the
                revised minutes to a council of sixty-two priesthood holders and church members on February 19.
                Joseph’s revisions were significant and both added and deleted material from the original minutes. The
                council unanimously voted to accept the revised minutes as “a form, and constitution of the high
                Council of the Church of Christ hereafter.” At the February 19 meeting, Joseph reported that “the
                Council was organized according to the ancient order, and also according to the mind of the Lord.”

        <verse>1</verse><span>This day a general council of twenty-four high priests assembled at the
        house of Joseph Smith, Jun., by revelation, and proceeded to organize the
        high council of the Church of Christ, which was to consist of twelve high
        priests, and one or three presidents as the case might require.
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>The high council was appointed by revelation for the purpose of settling
        important difficulties which might arise in the church, which could not
        be settled by the Church or the bishop’s council to the satisfaction of
        the parties.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>3</verse><span>Joseph Smith, Jun., Sidney Rigdon and Frederick G. Williams were acknowledged
        presidents by the voice of the council; and Joseph Smith, Sen., John Smith,
        Joseph Coe, John Johnson, Martin Harris, John S. Carter, Jared Carter,
        Oliver Cowdery, Samuel H.
        Smith, Orson Hyde, Sylvester Smith, and Luke Johnson, high priests, were
        chosen to be a standing council for the Church, by the unanimous voice
        of the council.
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>The above named councilors were then asked whether they accepted their appointments,
        and whether they would act in that office according to the law of heaven,
        to which they all answered that they accepted their appointments, and would
        fill their offices according to the grace of God bestowed upon them.
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>The number composing the council, who voted in the name and for the church
        in appointing the above-named councilors were forty- three, as follows:
        nine high priests, seventeen elders, four priests, and thirteen members.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>6</verse><span>Voted: that the high council cannot have power to act without seven of
        the above-named councilors, or their regularly appointed successors are
        present.
        </span><verse>7</verse><span>These seven shall have
        power to appoint other high priests, whom they may consider worthy and
        capable to act in the place of absent councilors.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>8</verse><span>Voted: that whenever any vacancy shall occur by the death, removal from
        office for
        transgression, or removal from the bounds of this church government, of
        any one of the above-named councilors, it shall be filled by the nomination
        of the president or presidents, and sanctioned by the voice of a general
        council of high priests, convened for that purpose, to act in the name
        of the Church.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>9</verse><span>The president of the church, who is also the president of the council,
        is appointed by
        revelation, and acknowledged in his administration by the voice of the
        Church.
        </span><verse>10</verse><span>And it is according to the dignity of his office that he should preside
        over the
        </span><ddunder>
            <manuscript><span>high council</span></manuscript><span>
            council
        </span></ddunder><span>
        of the
        Church; and it is his privilege to be assisted by two other presidents,
        appointed after the same manner that he himself was appointed.
        </span><verse>11</verse><span>And in case of the absence of one or both of those who are appointed to
        assist him, he has power to preside over the council without an assistant;
        and in case he himself is absent, the other presidents have power to preside
        in his stead, both or either of them.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>12</verse><span>Whenever a high council of the Church of Christ is regularly organized,
        according to the foregoing pattern, it shall be the duty of the twelve
        councilors to cast lots by numbers, and thereby ascertain who of the twelve
        shall speak first, commencing with number one and so in succession to number
        twelve.
        </span><verse>13</verse><span>Whenever this council convenes to act upon any case, the twelve councilors
        shall consider whether it is a difficult one or not; if it is not, two
        only of the councilors shall speak upon it, according to the form above
        written.
        </span><verse>14</verse><span>But if it is thought to be difficult, four shall be appointed; and if
        more difficult, six; but in no case shall more than six be appointed to
        speak.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>15</verse><span>The accused, in all cases, has a right to one-half of the council, to
        prevent insult or injustice.
        </span><verse>16</verse><span>And the councilors appointed to speak before the council are to present
        the
        case, after the evidence is examined, in its true light before the council;
        and every man is to speak according to equity and justice.
        </span><verse>17</verse><span>Those councilors who draw even numbers, that is, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12,
        are the individuals who are to stand up in behalf of the accused, and prevent
        insult and injustice.
        </span><verse>18</verse><span>In all cases the accuser and the accused shall have a
        privilege of speaking for themselves before the council, after the evidences
        are heard and the councilors who are appointed to speak on the case have
        finished their remarks.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>19</verse><span>After the evidences are heard, the councilors, accuser and accused have
        spoken, the
        president shall give a decision according to the understanding which he
        shall have of the case, and call upon the twelve councilors to sanction
        the same by their vote.
        </span><verse>20</verse><span>But should the remaining councilors, who have not spoken, or any one of
        them, after hearing the
        evidences and pleadings impartially, discover an error in the decision
        of the president, they can manifest it, and the case shall have a re-hearing.
        </span><verse>21</verse><span>And if, after a careful re-hearing, any additional light is shown upon
        the case, the decision shall be altered accordingly.
        </span><verse>22</verse><span>But in case no additional light is given, the first decision shall stand,
        the majority of the council having power to determine the same.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>23</verse><span>In case of difficulty respecting doctrine or principle, if there is not
        a sufficiency written to make the case clear to the minds of the council,
        the president may inquire and obtain the mind of the Lord by revelation.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>24</verse><span>The high priests, when abroad, have power to call and organize a council
        after the manner of the foregoing, to settle difficulties, when the parties
        or either of them shall
        request it.
        </span><verse>25</verse><span>And the said council of high priests shall have power to appoint one of
        their own number to preside over such council for the time being.
        </span><verse>26</verse><span>It shall be the duty of said council to transmit, immediately, a copy
        of their proceedings, with a full statement of the testimony accompanying
        their decision, to the high council of the seat of the First
        Presidency of the Church.
        </span><verse>27</verse><span>Should the parties or either of them be dissatisfied with the decision
        of said council, they may appeal to the high council of the seat of the
        First
        Presidency of the Church, and have a re-hearing, which case shall there
        be conducted,
        according to the former pattern written, as though no such decision had
        been made.
        </span><verse>28</verse><span>This council of high priests abroad is only to be called on the most difficult
        cases of church
        matters; and no common or ordinary case is to be sufficient to call such
        council.
        </span><verse>29</verse><span>The traveling or located high priests abroad have power to say whether
        it is necessary to call such a council or not.

        in their decisions.
        </span><verse>31</verse><span>From the
        decision of the former there can be an appeal; but from the decision of
        the latter there
        cannot.

                    On February 24, 1834, Parley P. Pratt and Lyman Wight, who had traveled from Missouri to Kirtland,
                    Ohio, reported to the Kirtland high council on the condition of the Missouri members, most of whom
                    had taken refuge in Clay County. Pratt and Wight asked the high council “how and by what means Zion
                    was to be redeemed from our enemies.” Joseph dictated this revelation that instructed the church how
                    to restore Missouri members to their Jackson County lands. Joseph then volunteered to lead an
                    expedition to Missouri to assist in Zion’s redemption, and thirty or forty others stated they would go
                    with him. Before adjourning, the council appointed Joseph Smith as “Commander in Chief of the
                    Armies of Israel and the leader of those who volunteered to go.”

        unto me.
        </span><verse>23</verse><span>And let all the churches send up wise men with their moneys, and purchase
        lands even as I have commanded them.
        </span><verse>24</verse><span>And inasmuch as mine enemies come against you to drive you from my goodly
        land, which I have consecrated to be the land of Zion, even from your own
        lands after these testimonies, which ye have brought before me against
        them, ye shall curse them;
        </span><verse>25</verse><span>and whomsoever ye curse, I will curse, and ye shall avenge me of mine
        enemies.
        </span><verse>26</verse><span>And my presence shall be with you even in avenging me of mine enemies,
        unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me.
        </span><verse>27</verse><span>Let no man be
        afraid to lay down his life for my sake; for whoso layeth down his life
        for my sake shall
        find it again.
        </span><verse>28</verse><span>And whoso is not willing to lay down his life for my sake is not my disciple.

        <verse>29</verse><span>It is my will that my servant Sidney Rigdon shall lift up his voice in
        the congregations in the eastern countries, in preparing the churches to

        <verse>30</verse><span>It is my will that my servant Parley P. Pratt and my servant Lyman Wight

        to go up unto the land of Zion, by tens, or by twenties, or by fifties,
        or by an hundred, until they have obtained to the number of five hundred
        of the strength of my house.

        do my will.

        obtain three

        ye may obtain one hundred.

                United Firm operations in Missouri were abandoned as church members fled, leaving the members of
                the United Firm with significant debt. Operations in Kirtland were also struggling with financial issues.
                Facing such problems, members of the Kirtland branch of the United Firm met on 10 April 1834 and
                decided that the firm should be dissolved.

                HC: Assembled in council with Elders Sidney Rigdon, Frederick G. Williams, Newel K. Whitney, John
                Johnson, and Oliver Cowdery; and united in asking the Lord to give Elder Zebedee Coltrin influence over Brother Jacob Myres, to obtain the money which he has gone to borrow for us, or cause him to
                come to this place and bring it himself. I also received the following:

        <verse>1</verse><span>Verily I say unto you, my friends, I give unto you counsel, and a commandment,
        concerning all the properties which belong to the order which I commanded
        to be
        organized and established, to be a united order, and an everlasting order
        for the benefit of my church, and for the salvation of men until I come—
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>with promise immutable and
        unchangeable, that inasmuch as those whom I commanded were faithful they
        should be blessed with a multiplicity of blessings;
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>but inasmuch as they were not faithful they were nigh unto cursing.

        Cursings
    </span></heading>

    <block>
        <verse>4</verse><span>Therefore, inasmuch as some of my servants have not kept the commandment,
        but have broken the covenant through covetousness, and with feigned words,
        I have cursed them with a very sore and grievous curse.
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>For I, the Lord, have decreed in my heart, that inasmuch as any man belonging
        to the order shall be found a transgressor, or, in other
        words, shall break the covenant with which ye are bound, he shall be cursed
        in his life, and shall be trodden down by whom I will;
        </span><verse>6</verse><span>for I, the Lord, am not to be mocked in these things—
        </span><verse>7</verse><span>and all this that the innocent among you may not be condemned with the
        unjust; and that the guilty among you may not escape; because I, the Lord,
        have promised unto you a crown of glory at my right hand.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>8</verse><span>Therefore, inasmuch as you are found transgressors, you cannot escape
        my wrath in your lives.
        </span><verse>9</verse><span>Inasmuch as ye are cut off for transgression, ye cannot escape the buffetings
        of Satan until the day of redemption.
        </span><verse>10</verse><span>And I now give unto you power from this very hour, that if any man among
        you, of the order, is found a transgressor and repenteth not of the evil,
        that ye shall deliver him over unto the buffetings of Satan; and he shall
        not have power to bring evil upon you.

        Alternate plan

    <block>
        <verse>11</verse><span>It is wisdom in me; therefore, a commandment I give unto you, that ye
        shall organize yourselves and appoint every man his stewardship;
        </span><verse>12</verse><span>that every man may give an account unto me of the stewardship which is
        appointed unto him.
        </span><verse>13</verse><span>For it is expedient that I, the Lord, should make every man accountable,
        as a steward over earthly blessings, which I have made and prepared for
        my creatures.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>14</verse><span>I, the Lord, stretched out the heavens, and built the earth, my very handiwork;
        and all things therein are mine.
        </span><verse>15</verse><span>And it is my purpose to provide for my saints, for all things are mine.
        </span><verse>16</verse><span>But it must needs be done in mine own way; and behold this is the way
        that I, the Lord, have decreed to provide for my saints, that the poor
        shall be exalted, in that the rich are made low.
        </span><verse>17</verse><span>For the earth is full, and there is enough and to spare; yea, I prepared
        all things, and have given unto the children of men to be agents unto themselves.
        </span><verse>18</verse><span>Therefore, if any man shall take of the abundance which I have made, and
        impart not his portion,
        according to the law of my gospel, unto the poor and the needy, he shall,
        with the wicked, lift up his eyes in hell, being in torment.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>19</verse><span>And now, verily I say unto you, concerning the properties of the order—
        </span><verse>20</verse><span>let my servant Sidney Rigdon have appointed unto him the place where he
        now resides, and the lot of the tannery for his stewardship, for his support
        while he is laboring in my vineyard, even as I will, when I shall command
        him.
        </span><verse>21</verse><span>And let all things be done according to the counsel of the order, and
        united consent or voice of the order, which dwell in the land of Kirtland.
        </span><verse>22</verse><span>And this stewardship and blessing, I, the Lord, confer upon my servant
        Sidney Rigdon
        for a blessing upon him, and his seed after him;
        </span><verse>23</verse><span>and I will multiply blessings upon him, inasmuch as he will be humble
        before me.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>24</verse><span>And again, let my servant Martin Harris have appointed unto him, for his
        stewardship, the lot of land which my servant John Johnson obtained in
        exchange for his former inheritance, for him and his seed after him;
        </span><verse>25</verse><span>and inasmuch as he is faithful, I will multiply blessings
        upon him and his seed after him.
        </span><verse>26</verse><span>And let my servant Martin Harris devote his moneys for the proclaiming
        of my words, according as my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., shall direct.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>27</verse><span>And again, let my servant Frederick G. Williams have the place upon which
        he now dwells.
        </span><verse>28</verse><span>And let my servant Oliver Cowdery have the lot which is set off joining
        the house, which is to be for the printing office, which is lot number
        one, and also the lot upon which his father resides.
        </span><verse>29</verse><span>And let my servants Frederick G. Williams and Oliver Cowdery have the
        printing office and all things that pertain unto it.
        </span><verse>30</verse><span>And this shall be their stewardship which shall be appointed unto them.
        </span><verse>31</verse><span>And inasmuch as they are
        faithful, behold I will bless, and multiply blessings upon them.
        </span><verse>32</verse><span>And this is the beginning of the stewardship which I have appointed them,
        for them and their seed after them.
        </span><verse>33</verse><span>And, inasmuch as they are faithful, I will multiply blessings upon them
        and their seed after them, even a multiplicity of blessings.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>34</verse><span>And again, let my servant John Johnson have the house in which he lives,
        and the inheritance, all save the ground which has been reserved for the
        building of my houses, which pertains to that inheritance, and those lots
        which have been named for my servant Oliver Cowdery.
        </span><verse>35</verse><span>And inasmuch as he is faithful, I will multiply blessings upon him.
        </span><verse>36</verse><span>And it is my will that he should sell the lots that are laid off for the
        building up of the city of my saints, inasmuch as it shall be made known
        to him by the voice of the Spirit, and according to the counsel of the
        order, and by the voice of the order.
        </span><verse>37</verse><span>And this is the beginning of the stewardship which I have appointed unto
        him, for a blessing unto him and his seed after him.
        </span><verse>38</verse><span>And inasmuch as he is faithful, I will multiply a multiplicity of blessings
        upon him.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>39</verse><span>And again, let my servant Newel K. Whitney have appointed unto him the
        houses and lot where he now resides, and the lot and building on which
        the mercantile establishment stands, and also the lot which is on the corner
        south of the mercantile establishment, and also the lot on which the ashery
        is situated.
        </span><verse>40</verse><span>And all this I have appointed unto my servant Newel K. Whitney for his
        stewardship, for a blessing upon him and his seed after him, for the benefit
        of the mercantile establishment of my order which I have established for
        my stake in the land of Kirtland.
        </span><verse>41</verse><span>Yea, verily, this is the stewardship which I have appointed unto my servant
        N. K. Whitney, even this whole mercantile establishment, him and his agent,
        and his seed after him.
        </span><verse>42</verse><span>And inasmuch as he is faithful in keeping my
        commandments, which I have given unto him, I will multiply blessings upon
        him and his seed after him, even a multiplicity of blessings.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>43</verse><span>And again, let my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., have appointed unto him
        the lot which is laid off for the building of my house, which is forty
        rods long and twelve wide, and also the inheritance upon which his father
        now resides;
        </span><verse>44</verse><span>and this is the beginning of the
        stewardship which I have appointed unto him, for a blessing upon him,
        and upon his father.
        </span><verse>45</verse><span>For behold, I have reserved an inheritance for his father, for his support;
        therefore he shall be reckoned in the house of my servant Joseph Smith,
        Jun.
        </span><verse>46</verse><span>And I will multiply blessings upon the house of my servant Joseph Smith,
        Jun., inasmuch as he is faithful, even a multiplicity of blessings.

    <block>
        <verse>47</verse><span>And now, a commandment I give unto you concerning Zion, that you shall
        no longer be bound as a united order to your brethren of Zion, only on
        this wise—
        </span><verse>48</verse><span>after you are
        organized, you shall be called the United Order of the Stake of Zion,
        the City of Kirtland. And your brethren, after they are organized, shall
        be called the United Order of the City of Zion.
        </span><verse>49</verse><span>And they shall be organized in their own names, and in their own name;
        and they shall do their business in their own name, and in their own names;
        </span><verse>50</verse><span>and you shall do your business in your own name, and in your own names.
        </span><verse>51</verse><span>And this I have commanded to be done for your salvation, and also for
        their salvation, in consequence of their being
        driven out and that which is to come.
        </span><verse>52</verse><span>The covenants being broken through transgression, by covetousness and
        feigned words—
        </span><verse>53</verse><span>therefore, you are dissolved as a united order with your brethren, that
        you are not bound only up to this hour unto them, only on this wise, as
        I said, by loan as shall be agreed by this order in council, as your circumstances
        will admit and the voice of the council direct.

    <block>
        <verse>54</verse><span>And again, a commandment I give unto you concerning your stewardship which
        I have appointed unto you.
        </span><verse>55</verse><span>Behold, all these properties are mine, or else your faith is vain, and
        ye are found hypocrites, and the covenants which ye have made unto me are
        broken;
        </span><verse>56</verse><span>and if the properties are mine, then ye are stewards; otherwise ye are
        no stewards.
        </span><verse>57</verse><span>But, verily I say unto you, I have appointed unto you to be stewards over
        mine house, even stewards indeed.
        </span><verse>58</verse><span>And for this purpose I have commanded you to organize yourselves, even
        to
        print my words, the fulness of my scriptures, the revelations which I
        have given unto you, and which I shall, hereafter, from time to time give
        unto you—
        </span><verse>59</verse><span>for the purpose of
        building up my church and kingdom on the earth, and to prepare my people
        for the time when I shall dwell with them, which is nigh at hand.

    <block>
        <verse>60</verse><span>And ye shall prepare for yourselves a place for a treasury, and consecrate
        it unto my name.
        </span><verse>61</verse><span>And ye shall appoint one among you to keep the treasury, and he shall
        be ordained unto this blessing.
        </span><verse>62</verse><span>And there shall be a seal upon the treasury, and all the sacred things
        shall be
        delivered into the treasury; and no man among you shall call it his own,
        or any part of it, for it shall belong to you all with one accord.
        </span><verse>63</verse><span>And I give it unto you from this very hour; and now see to it, that ye
        go to and make use of the stewardship which I have appointed unto you,
        exclusive of the sacred things, for the purpose of printing these sacred
        things as I have said.
        </span><verse>64</verse><span>And the avails of the sacred things shall be had in the treasury, and
        a seal shall be
        upon it; and it shall not be used or taken out of the treasury by any
        one, neither shall the seal be loosed which shall be placed upon it, only
        by the voice of the order, or by
        commandment.
        </span><verse>65</verse><span>And thus shall ye preserve the avails of the sacred things in the treasury,
        for sacred and holy purposes.
        </span><verse>66</verse><span>And this shall be called the sacred treasury of the Lord; and a seal shall
        be kept upon it that it may be holy and consecrated unto the Lord.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>67</verse><span>And again, there shall be another treasury prepared, and a treasurer appointed
        to keep the treasury, and a seal shall be placed upon it;
        </span><verse>68</verse><span>and all moneys that you receive in your stewardships, by improving upon
        the properties which I have appointed unto you, in houses, or in lands,
        or in cattle, or in all things save it be the holy and sacred writings,
        which I have reserved unto myself for holy and sacred purposes, shall
        be cast into the treasury as fast as you receive moneys, by hundreds, or
        by fifties, or by twenties, or by tens, or by fives.
        </span><verse>69</verse><span>Or in other words, if any man among you obtain five dollars let him
        cast them into the treasury; or if he obtain ten, or twenty, or fifty,
        or an hundred, let him do likewise;
        </span><verse>70</verse><span>and let not any among you say that it is his own; for it shall not be
        called his, nor any part of it.
        </span><verse>71</verse><span>And there shall not any part of it be used, or taken out of the treasury,
        only by the voice and common consent of the order.
        </span><verse>72</verse><span>And this shall be the voice and common consent of the order—that any man
        among you say to the treasurer, “I have need of this to help me in my stewardship”—
        </span><verse>73</verse><span>if it be five dollars, or if it be ten dollars, or twenty, or fifty, or
        a hundred, the treasurer shall give unto him the sum which he requires
        to help him in his stewardship—
        </span><verse>74</verse><span>until he be found a transgressor, and it is manifest before the council
        of the order plainly that he is an unfaithful and an unwise steward.
        </span><verse>75</verse><span>But so
        long as he is in full fellowship, and is faithful and wise in his stewardship,
        this shall be his token unto the treasurer that the treasurer shall not
        withhold.
        </span><verse>76</verse><span>But in case of
        transgression, the treasurer shall be subject unto the council and voice
        of the order.
        </span><verse>77</verse><span>And in case the treasurer is found an unfaithful and an unwise steward,
        he shall be subject to the council and voice of the order, and shall be
        removed out of his place, and another shall be appointed in his stead.

        <verse>78</verse><span>And again, verily I say unto you, concerning your debts—behold it is my
        will that you shall pay all your debts.
        </span><verse>79</verse><span>And it is my will that you shall humble yourselves before me, and obtain
        this blessing by your diligence and humility and the prayer of faith.
        </span><verse>80</verse><span>And inasmuch as you are diligent and humble, and exercise the prayer of
        faith, behold, I will soften the hearts of those to whom you are in debt,
        until I shall send means unto you for your deliverance.
        </span><verse>81</verse><span>Therefore write speedily to New York and write according to that
        which shall be dictated by my Spirit; and I will soften the hearts of
        those to whom you are in debt, that it shall be taken away out of their
        minds to bring affliction upon you.
        </span><verse>82</verse><span>And inasmuch as ye are humble and faithful and call upon my name, behold,
        I will give you the victory.

        </span><verse>84</verse><span>Inasmuch as you obtain a chance to loan money by hundreds, or thousands,
        even until you shall loan enough to deliver yourself from bondage, it
        is your privilege.
        </span><verse>85</verse><span>And pledge the properties which I have put into your hands, this once,
        by giving your names by common consent or otherwise, as it shall seem good
        unto you.
        </span><verse>86</verse><span>I give unto you this privilege, this once; and behold, if you proceed
        to do the things which I have laid before you, according to my commandments,
        all these things are mine, and ye are my stewards, and the master will
        not suffer his house to be broken up. Even so.</span><break></break><span>Amen.

                On June 21, the sheriff of Clay County, along with a delegation of men from Clay and Ray counties, met
                with Joseph Smith and members of the camp, informing them of the great alarm the expedition had
                caused among western Missouri residents. The following day, Joseph held a council to determine what
                steps the camp should take. During the council, he dictated this revelation

    <block>
        <verse>1</verse><span>Verily I say unto you who have assembled yourselves together that you
        may learn my will concerning the redemption of mine afflicted people—
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>2</verse><span>Behold, I say unto you, were it not for the transgressions of my people,
        speaking
        concerning the church and not individuals, they might have been redeemed
        even now.
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>But behold, they have not learned to be obedient to the things which I
        required at their hands, but are full of all manner of evil, and do not
        impart of their substance, as becometh saints, to the poor and afflicted
        among them;
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>and are not united according to the union
        required by the law of the celestial kingdom;
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>and Zion cannot be built up unless it is by the principles of the law
        of the celestial kingdom; otherwise I cannot receive her unto myself.
        </span><verse>6</verse><span>And my people must needs be chastened until they learn obedience, if it
        must needs be, by the things which they suffer.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>7</verse><span>I speak not concerning those who are appointed to lead my people, who
        are the first
        elders of my church, for they are not all under this condemnation;
        </span><verse>8</verse><span>but I speak concerning my churches abroad—there are many who will say,
        “Where is their God? Behold, he will
        deliver them in time of trouble, otherwise we will not go up unto Zion,
        and will keep our moneys.”
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>9</verse><span>Therefore, in consequence of the transgressions of my people, it is expedient
        in me that mine elders should wait for a little season for the redemption
        of Zion—
        </span><verse>10</verse><span>that they themselves may be prepared, and that my people may be taught
        more perfectly, and have experience, and know more perfectly concerning
        their duty, and the things which I
        require at their hands.
        </span><verse>11</verse><span>And this cannot be brought to pass until mine elders are endowed with
        power from on high.
        </span><verse>12</verse><span>For behold, I have prepared a great endowment and blessing to be poured
        out upon them, inasmuch as they are faithful and continue in humility before
        me.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>13</verse><span>Therefore it is expedient in me that mine elders should wait for a little
        season, for the redemption of Zion.
        </span><verse>14</verse><span>For behold, I do not require at their hands to fight the battles of Zion;
        for, as I said in a former commandment, even so will I fulfil —I will fight
        your battles.
        </span><verse>15</verse><span>Behold, the destroyer I have sent forth to destroy and lay waste mine
        enemies;
        and not many years hence they shall not be left to pollute mine heritage,
        and to blaspheme my name upon the lands which I have consecrated for the
        gathering together of my saints.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>16</verse><span>Behold, I have commanded my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., to say unto the
        strength of my house, even my warriors, my young men, and middle-aged,
        to gather together for the redemption of my people, and throw down the
        towers of mine enemies, and scatter their watchmen;
        </span><verse>17</verse><span>but the strength of mine house have not hearkened unto my words.
        </span><verse>18</verse><span>But inasmuch as there are those who have hearkened unto my words, I have
        prepared a
        blessing and an endowment for them, if they continue faithful.
        </span><verse>19</verse><span>I have heard their prayers, and will accept their offering; and it is
        expedient in me that they should be brought thus far for a trial of their
        faith.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>20</verse><span>And now, verily I say unto you, a commandment I give unto you, that as
        many as have come up hither, that can stay in the region round about, let
        them stay;
        </span><verse>21</verse><span>and those that
        cannot stay, who have families in the east, let them tarry for a little
        season, inasmuch as my servant Joseph shall appoint unto them;
        </span><verse>22</verse><span>for I will counsel him concerning this matter, and all things whatsoever
        he shall appoint unto them shall be fulfilled.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>23</verse><span>And let all my people who dwell in the regions round about be very faithful,
        and
        prayerful, and humble before me, and reveal not the things which I have
        revealed unto them, until it is wisdom in me that they should be revealed.
        </span><verse>24</verse><span>Talk not of judgments, neither boast of faith nor of mighty works, but
        carefully gather together, as much in one
        region as can be, consistently with the feelings of the people;
        </span><verse>25</verse><span>and behold, I will give unto you favor and grace in their eyes, that you
        may rest in peace and safety, while you are
        saying unto the people, “Execute judgment and justice for us according
        to law, and redress us of our wrongs.”
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>26</verse><span>Now, behold, I say unto you, my friends, in this way you may find favor
        in the eyes of the people, until the army of Israel becomes very great.
        </span><verse>27</verse><span>And I will soften the hearts of the people, as I did the heart of Pharaoh,
        from time to time, until my servant Joseph
        Smith, Jun., and mine elders, whom I have appointed, shall have time to
        gather up the
        strength of my house,
        </span><verse>28</verse><span>and to have sent wise men, to fulfil that which I have commanded concerning
        the purchasing of all the lands in Jackson county that can be purchased,
        and in the adjoining counties round about.
        </span><verse>29</verse><span>For it is my will that these lands should be
        purchased; and after they are purchased that my saints should possess
        them according to the laws of consecration which I have given.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>30</verse><span>And after these lands are purchased, I will hold the armies of Israel
        guiltless in taking possession of their own lands, which they have previously
        purchased with their moneys,
        and of throwing down the towers of mine enemies that may be upon them,
        and scattering their watchmen, and avenging me of mine enemies unto the
        third and fourth generation of them that hate me.
        </span><verse>31</verse><span>But first let my army become very great, and let it be sanctified before
        me, that it may become fair as the sun, and clear as the moon, and that
        her banners may be terrible unto all nations;
        </span><verse>32</verse><span>that the kingdoms of this world may be constrained to acknowledge that
        the kingdom of Zion is in very deed the kingdom of our God and his Christ;
        therefore, let us become subject unto her laws.

        Endowment from on high in Kirtland
    </span></heading>

    <block>
        <verse>33</verse><span>Verily I say unto you, it is expedient in me that the first elders of
        my church should
        receive their endowment from on high in my house, which I have commanded
        to be built unto my name in the land of Kirtland.
        </span><verse>34</verse><span>And let those commandments which I have given concerning Zion and her
        law be executed and fulfilled, after her redemption.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>35</verse><span>There has been a day of calling, but the time has come for a day of choosing;
        and let those be chosen that are worthy.
        </span><verse>36</verse><span>And it shall be manifest unto my servant, by the voice of the Spirit,
        those that are chosen; and they shall be sanctified;
        </span><verse>37</verse><span>and inasmuch as they follow the counsel which they receive, they shall
        have power after many days to
        accomplish all things pertaining to Zion.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>38</verse><span>And again I say unto you, sue for peace, not only to the people that have
        smitten you, but also to all people;
        </span><verse>39</verse><span>and lift up an ensign of peace, and make a proclamation of peace unto
        the ends of the earth;
        </span><verse>40</verse><span>and make proposals for peace unto those who have smitten
        you, according to the voice of the Spirit which is in you, and all things
        shall work together for your good.
        </span><verse>41</verse><span>Therefore, be faithful; and behold, and lo, I am with you even unto the
        end. Even so.</span><break></break><span>Amen.

        Use every effort to prevail on the churches to gather to those regions
        and situate themselves to be in readiness to move into Jackson County in
        two years from the 11</span><superscript><span>th</span></superscript><span>
        of September next which is the appointed time for the redemption of Zion…Verily
        I say unto you, if the church with one united effort perform their duties;
        if they do this, the work shall be complete…
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Now, my beloved brethren, you will learn by this we have a great work
        to do, and but little time to do it in; and if we do not exert ourselves
        to the utmost in gathering up the
        strength of the Lord's house that this thing may be accomplished,
        behold there remaineth a scourge for the Church, even that they shall be
        driven from city to city, and but few shall remain to receive an inheritance;
        if those things are not kept, there remaineth a
        scourge also; therefore, be wise this once, O ye children of Zion! and
        give heed to my counsel, saith the Lord.

                an October 1834 letter, he told Oliver that he “had thoughts of requesting you to enquire what is the

                On November 28, representatives of the Lewis, New York, branch of the church arrived with money
                collected from the branch to purchase land in Missouri. After meeting with the leaders, the
                representatives agreed to loan the money, $430, to the church. Joseph, Oliver, and Frederick G.
                Williams cosigned notes to repay the loans the following spring.

                Oliver in Kirtland on April 3, 1836. Daniel 9:24 says “Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people
                and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make
                reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and

                This revelation was received at the same time Oliver Cowdery was ordained a president of the high
                priesthood and Joseph Smith, Sr., was ordained Patriarch of the church. One specific change that
                resulted from this revelation was an increased use of titles when referring to leaders. Minutes of
                meetings held prior to this time referred to Joseph and other church leaders by their first names, but

                his son, Joseph, myself, Sidney Rigdon, and Frederick G. Williams, presidents of the church.” When
                writing this around September 1835, Oliver gave the date for this event as December 18,1833. Later
                research has shown the correct date to be December 6, 1834. This date is exactly two years after the
                reception of Section 86, which stated “the priesthood hath continued through the lineage of your
                fathers, for ye are lawful heirs according to the flesh.”

                wanted an expression from the brethren, if they would be satisfied to have the Spirit of the Lord
                dictate in the choice of the Elders to be Apostles; whereupon all the Elders present expressed their

                to pray, each one, and then proceed to choose twelve

        These were ordained under the hands of the Three Witnesses and great blessings
        were pronounced upon the head of each one by the spirit of prophecy and
        to be obtained through faithfulness.

                    <block><span>
                        Dear Brethren, previous to delivering the charge I shall read a part of
                        a revelation. It is known to you that previous to the organizing of this
                        church in 1830, the Lord gave
                        revelations or the church could not have been organized. The people of
                        this church were weak in faith compared with the ancients. Those who embarked
                        in this cause, were
                        desirous to know how the work was to be conducted. They read many things
                        in the Book of Mormon
                        concerning their duty and the way the great work ought to be done; but
                        the minds of men are so constructed that they will not believe without
                        a testimony of seeing or hearing. The Lord gave us a revelation that in
                        process of time there should be
                        Twelve chosen to preach his gospel to Jew and Gentile.
                    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Our minds have been on a constant stretch to find who these Twelve were.
        When the time should come, we could not tell, but we sought the Lord by
        fasting and prayer, to have our lives prolonged to see this day, to see
        you, and to take a retrospect of the
        difficulties through which we have passed. but, having seen the day, it
        becomes my duty to deliver to you a charge. And first, a few remarks respecting
        your ministry. You have many revelations put into your hands. Revelations
        to make you acquainted with the
        nature of your mission. You will have difficulties by reason of your visiting
        all the nations of the world. You will need wisdom in a tenfold proportion
        to what you have ever had. You will have to combat all the prejudices of
        all nations.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <note><span>D&amp;C 18</span></note><span>
        He then read the revelation and proceeded to say: Have you desired this
        ministry with all your hearts? If you have desired it, you are called of
        God, not of man, to go into all the world. He read again, from the revelation,
        what the Lord said to the Twelve. Brethren, you have your duty presented
        in this revelation. You have been ordained to the Holy
        Priesthood, You have received it from those who had their power and authority
        from an angel. You are to preach the gospel to every nation. Should you
        in the least degree come short of your duty, great will be your condemnation.
        for the greater the calling, the
        greater the transgression. I, therefore, warn you to cultivate great humility,
        for I know the pride of the human heart. Beware, lest the flatterers of
        the world lift you up. Beware lest your affections are captivated by worldly
        objects. Let your ministry be first. Remember the souls of men are committed
        to your charge, and if you mind your calling you shall
        always prosper.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        You have been indebted to other men in the first instance for evidence,
        on that you have acted. But it is necessary that you receive a testimony
        from heaven for yourselves, so that you can bear testimony to the truth
        of the Book of Mormon, and that you have seen
        the face of God. That is more than the testimony of an angel. When the
        proper time
        arrives, you shall be able to bear this testimony to the world. When you
        bear testimony that you have seen God, this testimony God will never suffer
        to fall, but will bear you out, although many will not give heed, yet others
        will. You will, therefore, see the necessity of getting this testimony
        from heaven.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Never cease striving until you have seen God, face to face. Strengthen
        your faith, cast off your doubts, your sins and all your unbelief and nothing
        can prevent you from coming to God. Your ordination is not full and complete
        till God has laid his hand upon you. We
        require as much to qualify us as did those who have gone before us. God
        is the same. If the Savior in former days laid his hands on his disciples,
        why not in the latter days?
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        With regard to superiority I must make a few remarks. The ancient Apostles
        sought to be great; but, brethren, lest the seeds of discord be sown in
        this matter, understand
        particularly the voice of the spirit on this occasion. God does not love
        you better or more than others. You are to contend for the faith once delivered
        to the saints. Jacob, you know wrestled till he obtained. It was by fervent
        prayer and diligent search that you have obtained the testimony you are
        now able to bear. You are as one, you are equal in bearing the keys of
        the kingdom to all nations. You are called to preach the gospel of the
        son of God to the nations of the earth. It is the will of your Heavenly
        Father that you proclaim his gospel to the ends of the earth. and the islands
        of the sea.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Be zealous to save souls. The soul of one man is as precious as the soul
        of another. You are to bear this message to those who consider themselves
        wise. and such may persecute you, they may seek your life. The adversary
        has always sought the life of the servants of God. You are, therefore,
        to be prepared at all times to make a sacrifice of your lives, should God
        require them in the advancement and building up of his cause. Murmur not
        at God. Be
        always prayerful, be always watchful. You will bear with me while I relieve
        the feelings of my heart. We shall not see another day like this. The time
        has fully come; the voice of the spirit has come to set these men apart.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        You will see the time when you will desire to see such a day as this,
        and you will not see it. Every heart wishes you peace and prosperity. but
        the scene, with you, will inevitably
        change. Let no man take your bishopric, and beware that you lose not your
        crowns. It will require your whole souls. It will require courage like
        Enoch’s.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        The time is near when you will be in the midst of congregations, who will
        gnash their teeth upon you. This gospel must roll and will roll till it
        fill the whole Earth. Did I say congregations would gnash upon you? Yea
        I say nations will gnash upon you. You will be considered the worst of
        men. Be not discouraged at this. When God pours out his Spirit, the enemy
        will rage, but God, remember, is on your right hand and on your left. A
        man, though he may be considered the worst, has joy who is conscious that
        he pleases God.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        The lives of those who proclaim the true gospel will be in danger; this
        has been the case ever since the days of righteous Abel. The same opposition
        has been manifest whenever men came forward to publish the gospel. The
        time is coming when you will be considered the worst by many, and by some
        the best of men. The time is coming when you will be perfectly familiar
        with the things of God. This testimony will make those who do not
        believe your testimony, seek your lives. But there are whole nations who
        will receive your testimony. They will call you good men. Be not lifted
        up when you are called good men. Remember you are young men, and you shall
        be spared, I include the other three. Bear them in mind in your prayers
        carry their cases to a throne of grace. Although they are not present,
        yet you and they are equal. This appointment is calculated to create an
        affection in you, for each other, stronger than death.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        You will travel to other nations; bear each other in mind. If one or more
        is cast into
        prisons, let the others pray for him, and deliver him by their prayers.
        Your lives shall be in great jeopardy, but the promise of God is that you
        shall be delivered.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Remember you are not to go to other nations till you receive your endowment.
        Tarry at Kirtland until you are endowed with power from on high. You need
        a fountain of
        wisdom, knowledge, and intelligence such as you never had. Relative to
        the endowment, I make a remark or two, that there be no mistake. The world
        cannot receive the things of God. He can endow you without worldly pomp
        or great parade. He can give you that
        wisdom, that intelligence and that power which characterized the ancient
        Saints and now characterizes the inhabitants of the upper world.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        The greatness of your commission consists in this: you are to hold the
        keys of this ministry. You are to go to the nations afar off; nations that
        sit in darkness. The day is coming when the work of God must be done. Israel
        shall be gathered, The seed of Jacob shall be gathered from their long
        dispersion. There will be a feast to Israel, the elect of God. It is a
        sorrowful tale, but the gospel must be preached and God’s ministers be
        rejected. but where can Israel be found, and receive your testimony, and
        not rejoice? Nowhere. The prophecies are full of great things that are
        to take place in the last days.
        After the elect are gathered out, destruction shall come on the inhabitants
        of the Earth. All nations shall feel the wrath of God, after they have
        been warned by the saints of the Most High. If you will not warn them others
        will and you will lose your crowns.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        You must prepare your minds to bid a long farewell to Kirtland. even till
        the great day come. You will see what you never expected to see. You will
        need the mind of Enoch or Elijah and the faith of the brother of Jared.
        You must be prepared to walk by faith,
        however appalling the prospect to human view. You, and each of you, should
        feel the force of the imperious mandate, “Son, go labor in my vineyard”
        and cheerfully receive what comes. But in the end you will stand while
        others will fall.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        You have read in the revelation concerning ordination, “Beware how you
        ordain, for all nations are not like this nation.” They will willingly
        receive the ordinances at your hand to put you out of the way. There will
        be times, when nothing but the angels of God can deliver you out of their
        hand. We appeal to your intelligence, we appeal to your
        understanding, that we have so far discharged our duty to you. We consider
        it one of the greatest condescensions of our Heavenly Father in pointing
        you out to us. You will be stewards over this ministry. We have work to
        do, that no other men can do. You must proclaim the gospel in its simplicity
        and purity. and we commend you to God and the word of his grace. You have
        our best wishes, you have our most fervent prayers, that you may be able
        to bear this testimony, that you have seen the face of God. Therefore,
        call
        upon him in faith and mighty prayer, till you prevail, for it is your
        duty and your privilege to bear such testimony for yourselves.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        We now exhort you to be faithful to fulfil your calling, there must be
        no lack here. You must fulfil in all things, and permit us to repeat, all
        nations have a claim on you. You are bound together as the three witnesses
        were. You, notwithstanding can part and meet, and meet and part again,
        till your heads are silvered over with age.

                HC: President Smith proposed the following question: “What importance is there attached to the
                calling of these Twelve Apostles, different from other callings or officers of the Church?” After the
                question was discussed by Councilors Patten, Young, Smith, and McLellin, President Joseph Smith, Jr.,
                gave the following decision:

        They are the Twelve Apostles, who are called to the office of the Travelling

        presidency established; and they are to travel and preach among the Gentiles,
        until the Lord shall command them to go to the Jews. They are to hold the
        keys of this ministry, to unlock the door of the kingdom of heaven unto
        all nations, and to preach the gospel to every creature. This is the power,
        authority, and virtue of their apostleship.

                following are the names of those who were ordained and blessed at that time, to begin the
                organization of the first quorum of Seventies, according to the visions and revelations which I have
                received. The Seventies are to constitute traveling quorums, to go into all the earth, whithersoever the
                Twelve Apostles shall call them.

                HC: This afternoon (March 28</span><superscript><span>th</span></superscript><span>) the Twelve met in council, and had a time of general confession. On
                reviewing our past course we are satisfied, and feel to confess also, that we have not realized the
                importance of our calling to that degree that we ought; we have been light-minded and vain, and in
                many things have done wrong. For all these things we have asked the forgiveness of our heavenly
                Father; and wherein we have grieved or wounded the feelings of the Presidency, we ask their
                forgiveness. The time when we are about to separate is near; and when we shall meet again, God only
                knows; we therefore feel to ask of him whom we have acknowledged to be our Prophet and Seer, that
                he inquire of God for us, and obtain a revelation, (if consistent) that we may look upon it when we are
                separated, that our hearts may be comforted. Our worthiness has not inspired us to make this request,
                but our unworthiness. We have unitedly asked God our heavenly Father to grant unto us through His
                Seer, a revelation of His mind and will concerning our duty the coming season, even a great revelation,
                that will enlarge our hearts, comfort us in adversity, and brighten our hopes amidst the powers of
                darkness. In compliance with the above request, I inquired of the Lord, and received for answer the
                following:

        ORDERS OF THE PRIESTHOOD

    <block>
        <verse>1</verse><span>There are, in the church, two priesthoods, namely, the Melchizedek and
        Aaronic, including the Levitical Priesthood.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>2</verse><span>Why the first is called the Melchizedek Priesthood is because Melchizedek

        the too frequent repetition of his name, they, the church, in ancient days,

                HC: A grand council was held in Kirtland…after the conference was opened, and the Twelve had taken
                their seats, President Joseph Smith, Jr., said that it would be the duty of the Twelve, when in council, to
                take their seats together according to age, the oldest to be seated at the head, and preside in the first
                council, the next oldest in the second, and so on until the youngest had presided; and then begin at the
                oldest again. President Joseph Smith then stated that:
            </span></block>

    <block><span>
        The Twelve will have no right to go into Zion, or any of its stakes, and
        there undertake to regulate the affairs thereof, where there is a standing
        high council; but it is their duty to go abroad and regulate all matters
        relative to the different branches of the Church. When the Twelve are together,
        or a quorum of them, in any church, they will have authority to act independently,
        and make decisions, and those decision will be valid. But where there is
        not a quorum, they will have to do business by the voice of the Church.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        No standing High Council has authority to go into the churches abroad,
        and regulate the matters thereof, for this belongs to the Twelve.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        The Twelve and the Seventy have particularly to depend upon their ministry
        for their support, and that of their families; and they have a right, by
        virtue of their offices, to call upon the churches to assist them.

                1835 by the presidency of the Church of the Latter Day Saints, for the
                purpose of examining a Book Of Commandments
                and covenants, which has been compiled and written
                by the following committee, which was appointed by a general assembly of the Church in Kirtland Sept.

                1834 and instructing the writers of said book. This committee was nominated by the speaker of

                The names of the committee are as follows: Joseph Smith Jr., Sidney Rigdon, Oliver Cowdery, and Frederick G. Williams.

            <block><span>
                This committee having finished said book according to the instructions given them, it was deemed
                necessary to call the general assembly of the Church to see whether the book be approved or not by
                the authorities of the church, that it may, if approved, become a law unto the church, and a rule of
                faith and practice unto the same.

                        President Oliver Cowdery then arose with the book of Doctrine And Covenants
                        containing the faith articles and covenants of the Latter Day Saints,
                        then proceeded to take the vote of the whole House commencing with the
                        Presidents of Zion.
                    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        President William Phelps arose and spoke in high commendation of the book
        aforenamed and said that he had examined it carefully, that it was well
        arranged and calculated to
        govern the church in righteousness, if followed would bring the members
        to see eye to eye. And further that he had received the testimony from
        God, that the revelations and commandments contained therein are true,
        wherefore, he knew assuredly for himself having received witness from heaven,
        and not from men.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        President John Whitmer testified also that he was well acquainted with
        the work and knew it to be true and from God.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        President John Smith arose and testified his joy, that we have at length
        received the long wished for document to govern the church in righteousness
        and bring the Elders to see eye
        to eye: and further that he was present when some of the revelations contained
        therein were given, and was satisfied they came from God.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        President John Smith then called the vote of the Presidency which was
        carried as follows: that they would receive the book as the rule of their
        faith and practice, and put themselves under the guidance of the same and
        also that they were satisfied with the committee that were chosen to compile
        it, as having discharged their duty faithfully. The vote of the high council
        was then called and carried in confirmation of the above.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Counsellor Levi Jackman, then arose and said that he had examined as many
        of the
        revelations contained in the book as were printed in Zion and as firmly
        believes them as he does the Book of Mormon or the Bible
        and also the whole contents of the book. He then called for the vote of
        the High Council from Zion, which they gave in favor of the book and also
        of the committee.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        President Phelps, then arose and read the written testimony of the 12
        Apostles in favor of the book and the committee who compiled it. The Presidents
        of the 70 Apostles were then called upon to give their decision on the
        said book. President Leonard Rich, who was appointed to speak for the Seventy
        on this occasion, took the book and said that he had
        examined the Lectures and many of the revelations contained in it, and
        was perfectly satisfied with the same, and further, that he knew that they
        were true by the testimony of the Holy Spirit of God given unto him; he
        then called for the vote of as many of the
        Seventy as were present, which was unanimously given in favor of the book,
        and also that they were perfectly satisfied with the committee that compiled
        it.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        The book was then presented to Newel K. Whitney, Bishop of Kirtland, who
        received it and testified that he had examined the Lectures that were contained
        in it, and that he
        believed them beyond a doubt, and the revelations contained in it he knew
        were true, for God had testified to him by his holy Spirit, for many of
        them were given under his roof and in his presence through President Joseph
        committee Smith Jr., the prophet of Lord. He then called for the vote of
        his counsellors, which was given in favor of the book and also of the committee
        that compiled it as having discharged their duty faithfully.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        The book was then handed to counsellor John Corrill, who acted in the
        place of Edward Partridge, Bishop in Zion. He said that he received it
        with great joy and was perfectly satisfied with the same, and most cordially
        received it as a rule of faith and practice, and also his entire satisfaction
        with the labors of the committee. He also stated that he knew the work
        to be true, then called for the vote of his council which was given in
        favor of the book and of the committee.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Elder John Gould then took the book and said that he knew it was true,
        and also the Book of Mormon, because he had received the testimony
        of the Spirit in favor of them,
        and that he was well satisfied with the committee. He called for the voice
        of the Elders, which was given in favor of the work and that they were
        satisfied with the committee.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Priest Ira Ames took the book and said he was present in the general assembly
        which appointed the committee, and that he was well satisfied with the
        fruit of their labors. He then took the vote of the Priests, who gave their
        voice to receive it, being satisfied with the labors of the committee.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        The book being handed to Teacher Erastus Babbitt, he arose and said he
        had been present when one of the revelations contained in it was given,
        and that he received it at the time as coming from God, and that he was
        willing to be governed by the rules contained in the book, for he verily
        believed them to be good, and he was well satisfied with the labors of
        the committee. He also obtained the voice of all the Teachers present
        in favor of the work and the committee.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Deacon William Burgess took the book into his hands stating that he fully
        approved of the matter contained in it, and gave his voice in favor of
        the committee. There being only one Deacon present beside himself, he called
        upon him to give his voice concerning this book, and he said he received
        it with joy and was satisfied with the committee.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Brother Thomas Gates then took the book and expressed his satisfaction
        with it, and also called a vote of all the members present, both male and
        female, and they gave a decided voice in favor of it and also of the committee.
        There being a very large portion of the
        church present, all of the above testimonies and votes were voluntarily
        and unhesitatingly given with the utmost freedom of conscience on part
        of the assembly.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        President William W. Phelps then arose and read a chapter of Rules for
        Marriage among the Saints, and the whole church voted to receive it. It
        is therefore to be attached to the book.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        President Oliver Cowdery then arose and read an instrument containing
        certain principles or items upon laws in general and church government.
        Vote of the whole house called for and unanimously given by the usual sign
        of uplifted hands in favor of the same.

        </span><quote><span>
            The testimony of the witnesses to the book of the Lord’s commandments,
            which he gave to his church through Joseph Smith, Jr. who was appointed
            by the voice of the
            church for this purpose: we therefore feel willing to bear testimony to
            all the world of mankind, to every creature upon the face of all the earth,
            and upon the islands of the sea, that the Lord has borne record to our
            souls, through the Holy Ghost shed forth
            upon us, that these commandments were given by inspiration of God, and
            are
            profitable for all men, and are verily true. We give this testimony unto
            the world, the Lord being our helper: and it is through the grace of God
            the Father and his Son Jesus Christ, that we are permitted to have this
            privilege of bearing this testimony unto the world, in the which we rejoice
            exceedingly, praying the Lord always, that the
            children of men may be profited thereby.

        The venerable President Thomas Gates, then bore record of the truth of
        the book, and with his five silver-headed assistants, and the whole congregation,
        accepted and

        Doctrine And Covenants
        of their faith, by a unanimous

        <verse>1</verse><span>According to the custom of all civilized nations, marriage is regulated
        by laws and
        ceremonies: therefore we believe, that all marriages in this church of
        Christ of Latter Day Saints, should be solemnized in a public meeting,
        or feast, prepared for that purpose: and that the solemnization should
        be performed by a presiding high priest, high priest, bishop, elder, or
        priest, not even prohibiting those persons who are desirous to get married,
        of being married by other authority. We believe that it is not right to
        prohibit members of this church from marrying out of the church, if it
        be their determination so to do, but
        such persons will be considered weak in the faith of our Lord and Savior
        Jesus Christ.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>2</verse><span>Marriage should be celebrated with prayer and thanksgiving; and at the
        solemnization, the persons to be married, standing together, the man on
        the right, and the woman on the left, shall be addressed, by the person
        officiating, as he shall be directed by the holy Spirit; and if there be
        no legal objections, he shall say, calling each by their names: “You both
        mutually agree to be each other’s companion, husband and wife, observing
        the legal rights
        belonging to this condition; that is, keeping yourselves wholly for each
        other, and from all others, during your lives.” And when they have answered
        “Yes,” he shall pronounce them husband and wife in the name of the Lord
        Jesus Christ, and by virtue of the laws of the country and authority vested
        in him: “May God add his blessings and keep you to fulfill your covenants
        from henceforth and forever.</span><break></break><span>Amen.”
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>3</verse><span>The clerk of every church should keep a record of all marriages, solemnized
        in his branch.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>4</verse><span>All legal contracts of marriage made before a person is baptized into
        this church, should be held sacred and fulfilled.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Inasmuch as this church of Christ has been reproached with the crime of
        fornication, and polygamy: we declare that we believe, that one man should
        have one wife; and one woman, but one husband, except in case of death,
        when either is at liberty to marry again.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        It is not right to persuade a woman to be baptized contrary to the will
        of her husband, neither is it lawful to influence her to leave her husband.
        All children are bound by law to obey their parents; and to influence them
        to embrace any religious faith, or be baptized, or leave their parents
        without their consent, is unlawful and unjust. We believe that all persons
        who exercise control over their fellow beings, and prevent them from embracing
        the truth, will have to answer for that sin.

            <block><span>HC: President Oliver Cowdery then read the following article on Governments and Laws in General which was accepted and adopted and ordered to be printed in said book, by a unanimous vote:</span></block>

        </sectioninfo>
    </sectionheader><chapter style="display: none">1</chapter>
    <block>
        <verse>1</verse><span>We believe that governments were instituted of God for the benefit of
        man; and that he holds men accountable for their acts in relation to them,
        both in making laws and
        administering them, for the good and safety of society.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>2</verse><span>We believe that no government can exist in peace, except such laws are
        framed and held inviolate as will secure to each individual the free exercise
        of conscience, the right and control of property, and the protection of
        life.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>3</verse><span>We believe that all governments necessarily require civil officers and
        magistrates to enforce the laws of the same; and that such as will administer
        the law in equity and justice should be sought for and upheld by the voice
        of the people if a republic, or the will of the sovereign.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>4</verse><span>We believe that religion is instituted of God; and that men are amenable
        to him, and to him only, for the exercise of it, unless their religious
        opinions prompt them to infringe
        upon the rights and liberties of others; but we do not believe that human
        law has a right to interfere in prescribing rules of worship to bind the
        consciences of men, nor dictate forms for public or private devotion; that
        the civil magistrate should restrain crime, but never control conscience;
        should punish guilt, but never suppress the freedom of the soul.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>5</verse><span>We believe that all men are bound to sustain and uphold the respective
        governments in which they reside, while protected in their inherent and
        inalienable rights by the laws of such governments; and that sedition and
        rebellion are unbecoming every citizen thus protected, and should be punished
        accordingly; and that all governments have a right to enact such laws as
        in their own judgments are best calculated to secure the public interest;
        at the same time, however, holding sacred the freedom of conscience.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>6</verse><span>We believe that every man should be honored in his station, rulers and
        magistrates as such, being placed for the protection of the innocent and
        the punishment of the guilty; and that to the laws all men owe respect
        and deference, as without them peace and
        harmony would be supplanted by anarchy and terror; human laws being instituted
        for the express purpose of regulating our interests as individuals and
        nations, between man and man; and divine laws given of heaven, prescribing
        rules on spiritual concerns, for faith and worship, both to be answered
        by man to his Maker.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>7</verse><span>We believe that rulers, states, and governments have a right, and are
        bound to enact laws for the protection of all citizens in the free exercise
        of their religious belief; but we do not believe that they have a right
        in justice to deprive citizens of this privilege, or proscribe them in
        their opinions, so long as a regard and reverence are shown to the laws
        and such
        religious opinions do not justify sedition nor conspiracy.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>8</verse><span>We believe that the commission of crime should be punished according to
        the nature of the offense; that murder, treason, robbery, theft, and the
        breach of the general peace, in all respects, should be punished according
        to their criminality and their tendency to evil among men, by the laws
        of that government in which the offense is committed; and for the public
        peace and tranquility all men should step forward and use their ability
        in
        bringing offenders against good laws to punishment.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>9</verse><span>We do not believe it just to mingle religious influence with civil government,
        whereby one religious society is fostered and another proscribed in its
        spiritual privileges, and the individual rights of its members, as citizens,
        denied.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>10</verse><span>We believe that all religious societies have a right to deal with their
        members for
        disorderly conduct, according to the rules and regulations of such societies;
        provided that such dealings be for fellowship and good standing; but we
        do not believe that any religious society has authority to try men on the
        right of property or life, to take from them this world’s goods, or to
        put them in jeopardy of either life or limb, or to inflict any physical
        punishment upon them. They can only excommunicate them from their society,
        and
        withdraw from them their fellowship.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>11</verse><span>We believe that men should appeal to the civil law for redress of all
        wrongs and grievances, where personal abuse is inflicted or the right of
        property or character
        infringed, where such laws exist as will protect the same; but we believe
        that all men are justified in defending themselves, their friends, and
        property, and the government, from the unlawful assaults and encroachments
        of all persons in times of exigency, where immediate appeal cannot be made
        to the laws, and relief afforded.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>12</verse><span>We believe it just to preach the gospel to the nations of the earth, and
        warn the righteous to save themselves from the corruption of the world;
        but we do not believe it right to
        interfere with bond-servants, neither preach the gospel to, nor baptize
        them contrary to the will and wish of their masters, nor to meddle with
        or influence them in the least to
        cause them to be dissatisfied with their situations in this life, thereby
        jeopardizing the lives of men; such interference we believe to be unlawful
        and unjust, and dangerous to the peace of every government allowing human
        beings to be held in servitude.

                An explanatory note written by Cowdery in Patriarchal Blessing Book 1 states that he felt a personal
                desire to know the mind of the Spirit concerning Joseph Smith. Cowdery “besought the Lord in prayer
                and fasting,” and, according to Cowdery, God “opened the heavens upon me” and provided the
                blessing for Joseph Smith in the form of a heavenly vision.

        Blessed of the Lord is my brother, for the integrity of his heart and
        the steadfastness of his soul. Upheld by the arm of the Almighty he shall
        never fall, but shall be strengthened by his right hand till he overcomes.
        Like Jacob of old he shall wrestle with the angel, and as a prince shall
        he have power with God, and shall prevail.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Ever faithful to his friends and true to his word, the goodness of the
        Most High shall sustain him, and thousands shall stand up to defend him
        from the hand of his enemies, and put forth the hand and ward off the blow
        were it needful: but ere his foes are aware he shall be hid under the pavilion
        of the Lord Jehovah; for, with the voice of his thunder shall he strike
        terror to their hearts, and as with the wings of an eagle shall my brother
        be carried beyond all harm, by the power of the Anointed. From amid the burning
        bush, like Moses of old, shall he hear the voice, saying, “I am the God
        of thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, I have seen, I have seen, the
        affliction of my people and am come down to
        deliver them. Go, thou, and say to the strength of my house, ‘To your
        tents, O Israel: build up the wastes and raise up the foundation of desolation
        that this generation has made.’”
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Thus shall he be honored of the Lord, and thus shall it be recorded of
        him, that the generations to come may bless his name, in Israel, saying,
        “The Lord make thee as Joseph the Seer, who was of the house of Ephraim,
        the brother of Manasseh: the Lord do thee
        good and bring peace and blessings upon thy house as he brought them upon
        the house of Joseph the Seer, who was raised up of a choice vine from the
        stem of Jacob through the root of Joseph, even that Joseph who was separated
        from his brethren.”
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        For, like Joseph of old shall he be: he shall save the just from desolation,
        by the wise
        counsel of the Almighty; for by his direction shall they gather into store-houses
        and barns, till they overflow with the richness of the fruit of harvest:
        and by this means shall the just be saved from famine, while the nations
        of the wicked are distressed and faint.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        In due time shall he go forth toward the north, and by the power of his
        word shall the
        deep begin to give way and the ice melt before the sun. By the keys of
        the Kingdom shall he lead Israel into the land of Zion while the house
        of Jacob shouts in the dance and in the song—Joy, O my soul, in that day,
        for thou shalt be with him and bear thy part in the keys which are confirmed
        upon thee for an everlasting priesthood, forever and ever— Joy, O my heart,
        in that day, with thanks giving and with praise, for thou shalt stand with
        him before the hosts of Israel— the lame shall leap as a hart, the old
        shall renew his strength, and the virgin of Israel, with the youth, shall
        exalt the name of our God upon harps and instruments of tense strings.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        He shall be a sure arrow in the bow of his God, for he shall be hid under
        the shadow of his wing. His loins shall be like iron, girded by the hand
        of the Lord, and his feet shall be swift to execute the commandment of
        the Most High when he shall say, “Destroy.” His name shall be had in everlasting
        remembrance, and his name &lt;seed&gt; after him, for they shall be saved
        to the uttermost.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        His fame shall be sounded in foreign lands, even to the ends of the earth,
        as well as nigh at home: for in this the times shall change— a prophet
        shall have honor in his own country.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        His learning and wisdom shall astonish the great, for they shall acknowledge
        that by his intelligence he has far surpassed their learning and their
        science. In palaces of governors, rulers and kings shall he be honored,
        even in his person, for God shall give him power to prevail. He shall be
        a lawgiver to Israel and shall teach the house of Jacob the statutes of
        the Most High. His testimony shall shine like the sun, and the weight
        of his influence shall be like the great river that rises on the east of
        the lasting hills, and flows into the great
        deep—so shall his righteousness ever abound.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        He shall partake of the blessings of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob: the chief
        things of the
        ancient mountains, the precious things that couch beneath, and of the
        treasures hid in the sand. The records of past ages and generations, and
        the histories of ancient days shall he
        bring forth: even the record of the Nephites shall he again obtain, with
        all those hid up by Mormon, and others who were righteous, and many others,
        till he is overwhelmed with knowledge. No precious thing shall slumber
        from his possession, for he shall be covered
        with the most choice of all ages, till his soul shall be satisfied and
        his heart shall say, “Enough, Enough!”
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        In his hands shall the Urim and Thummim remain and the holy ministry,
        and the keys of the evangelical priesthood, also, for an everlasting priesthood
        forever, even the patriarchal; for, behold, he is the first patriarch in
        the last days. He shall sit in the great assembly and general council of
        patriarchs, and execute the will and commandment of God under the
        direction of the Ancient of Days; for he shall have his place and act
        in his station.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Behold, my brother Joseph is blessed: blessed are all who bless him, and
        blessed are all those whom he blesses. Multitudes, multitudes, shall come
        to a knowledge of the truth through his ministry, and he shall be welcomed
        into the presence of kings and the great ones of the earth; for he shall
        claim his place among the nobles of the earth and shall be
        reverenced by them. He shall also be filled with the abundance of the
        fat of the earth: his flocks shall bring forth thousands and tens of thousands:
        his vats shall overflow with wine and oil; his cattle shall increase to
        a multitude; he shall have horses and mules, asses, she asses and dromedaries,
        camels and elephants, and all swift beasts, and when he goes forth in haste
        his chariots shall roar like the approach of an army; he shall have gold
        and silver, precious stones, diamonds, pearls, and the pure platinum, with
        the antiquities of every kind.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Thus shall God bless, and thus shall he be prospered: and he shall have
        peace after a little; for his enemies shall be consumed, many of them,
        and many shall turn and be his friends in very deed: he shall remain to
        a good old age, even till his head is like the pure wool.
        Behold, there is no end to the vision, of the multiplicity of blessings
        and glories which shall come upon my brother Joseph. He shall possess a
        mansion on high and have an
        inheritance in that city which is like pure gold, even like transparent
        glass. His rest shall be glorious and his name remain forever.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Thus closes the vision, and thus it shall be; even so.</span><break></break><span>Amen.

    <block><span>
        Behold they are under condemnation, because they have not been sufficiently

        they have not dealt equally
        with each other in the division of the moneys which came into their hands.

        and in faith and wait on me in patience and my servant William shall return,
        and I will yet make him a polished shaft in my quiver, in bringing down
        the wickedness and abominations of men and their shall be none mightier
        than he in his day and generation. Nevertheless if he‌
        repent not speedily he shall be brought low and shall be chastened sorely
        for all his
        iniquities he has committed against me. Nevertheless the sin which he
        hath sinned against me is not even now more grievous than the sin with
        which my servant David W. Patten and my servant Orson Hyde and my servant
        William E. McLellin have sinned against me, and the residue are not sufficiently
        humble before me.

        Behold the parable which I spake concerning a man having twelve sons,
        for what man among you having twelve sons and is no respecter to them and
        they serve him obediently and he saith unto the one, “Be thou clothed in
        robes and sit thou here,” and to the other, “Be thou clothed in rags and
        sit thou there,” and looketh upon his sons and saith, “I am just,” ye will
        answer and say, “No man,” and ye answer truly, therefore.

        Verily thus saith the Lord your God, I appointed these twelve that they
        should be equal in their ministry and in their portion and in their evangelical
        rights, wherefore they have sinned a very grievous sin, inasmuch as they
        have made themselves unequal and have not hearkened unto my voice therefore
        let them repent speedily and prepare their hearts for the solemn assembly
        and for the great day which is to come. Verily thus saith the Lord.</span><break></break><span>Amen.

                On the morning of November 9, a man calling himself “Joshua the Jewish minister,” arrived at the
                home of Joseph Smith in Kirtland. Joseph hosted him for the next two days and invited him to expound
                on his religious views, but he ultimately denounced his visitor and told him to leave. History of the
                Church was edited to attribute this quotation to the visitor, whereas the original quotation in context
                seems to have come from Joseph.

                HC: This evening, at 6 o’clock, met with the Council of the Twelve, by their request. Nine of them were
                present. Council opened by singing and prayer. And I made some remarks as follows:

        The endowment you are so anxious about, you cannot comprehend now, nor
        could
        Gabriel explain it to the understanding of your dark minds; but strive
        to be prepared in your hearts, be faithful in all things, that when we
        meet in the solemn assembly, that is, when such as God shall name out of
        all the official members shall meet, we must be clean every whit. Let us
        be faithful and silent, brethren, and if God gives you a manifestation,
        keep it to yourselves; be watchful and prayerful, and you shall have a
        prelude of those joys that God will pour out on that day. Do not watch
        for iniquity in each other, if you do you will not get an endowment, for
        God will not bestow it on such. But if we are faithful, and live by every
        word that proceeds forth from the mouth of God, I will venture to prophesy
        that we shall get a blessing that will be worth remembering, if we should
        live as long as John the Revelator; our blessings will be such as we have
        not realized before, nor received in this generation. The order of the
        house of God has been, and ever will be, the same,
        even after Christ comes; and after the termination of the thousand years
        it will be the same; and we shall finally enter into the celestial Kingdom
        of God, and enjoy it forever.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        You need an endowment, brethren, in order that you may be prepared and
        able to
        overcome all things; and those that reject your testimony will be damned.
        The sick will be healed, the lame made to walk, the deaf to hear, and the
        blind to see, through your
        instrumentality. But let me tell you, that you will not have power, after
        the endowment to heal those that have not faith, nor to benefit them, for
        you might as well expect to benefit a devil in hell as such as are possessed
        of his spirit, and are willing to keep it; for they are habitations for
        devils, and only fit for his society. But when you are endowed and prepared
        to preach the Gospel to all nations, kindred, and tongues, in their own
        languages, you must faithfully warn all, and bind up the testimony, and
        seal up the law, and the
        destroying angel will follow close at your heels, and exercise his tremendous
        mission upon the children of disobedience; and destroy the workers of iniquity,
        while the Saints will be gathered out from among them, and stand in holy
        places ready to meet the Bridegroom when he comes.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        I feel disposed to speak a few words more to you, my brethren, concerning
        the
        endowment. All who are prepared, and are sufficiently pure to abide the
        presence of the Savior, will see Him in the solemn assembly.

                HC: At early candle-light I met with the Presidency at the west school room, in the Temple, to attend to
                the ordinance of anointing our heads with holy oil; also the Councils of Kirtland and Zion met in the
                two adjoining rooms, and waited in prayer while we attended to the ordinance. I took the oil in my left
                hand, Father Smith being seated before me, and the remainder of the Presidency encircled him round
                about. We then stretched our right hands towards heaven, and blessed the oil, and consecrated it in
                the name of Jesus Christ.
            </span></block>

            <block><span>
                We then laid our hands upon our aged Father Smith, and invoked the blessings of heaven. I then
                anointed his head with the consecrated oil, and sealed many blessings upon him. The Presidency then
                in turn laid their hands upon his head, beginning at the oldest, until they had all laid their hands upon
                him, and pronounced such blessings upon his head, as the Lord put into their hearts, all blessing him to
                be our Patriarch, to anoint our heads, and attend to all duties that pertain to that office.
            </span></block>

            <block><span>
                The Presidency then took the seat in their turn, according to their age, beginning at the oldest, and
                received their anointing and blessing under the hands of Father Smith. And in my turn, my father
                anointed my head, and sealed upon me the blessings of Moses, to lead Israel in the latter days, even as
                Moses led him in days of old; also the blessings of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. All of the Presidency laid
                their hands upon me, and pronounced upon my head many prophecies and blessings, many of which I
                shall not notice at this time. But as Paul said, so say I, let us come to visions and revelations.

                    I saw the Twelve Apostles of the Lamb, who are now upon the earth, who
                    hold the keys of this last ministry, in foreign lands, standing together
                    in a circle, much fatigued, with their clothes tattered and feet swollen,
                    with their eyes cast downward, and Jesus standing in their midst, and they
                    did not behold Him. The Savior looked upon them and wept. I also beheld
                    Elder McLellin in the south, standing upon a hill, surrounded by a vast
                    multitude, preaching to them, and a lame man standing before him supported
                    by his
                    crutches; he threw them down at his word and leaped as a hart, by the
                    mighty power of God. Also, I saw Elder Brigham Young standing in a strange
                    land, in the far south and west, in a desert place, upon a rock in the
                    midst of about a dozen men of color, who appeared hostile. He was preaching
                    to them in their own tongue, and the angel of God standing above his head,
                    with a drawn Sword in his hand, protecting him, but he did not see it.
                </span></block>

                <block><span>
                    And I finally saw the Twelve in the celestial kingdom of God. I also beheld
                    the
                    redemption of Zion, and many things which the tongue of man cannot describe
                    in full.
                </span></block>

                <block><span>
                    Many of my brethren who received the ordinance with me saw glorious visions
                    also.
                    Angels ministered unto them as well as to myself, and the power of the
                    Highest rested
                    upon us, the house was filled with the glory of God, and we shouted Hosanna
                    to God and the Lamb. My scribe also received his anointing with us, and
                    saw, in a vision, the armies of heaven protecting the Saints in their return
                    to Zion, and many things which I saw. The Bishop of Kirtland with his Counselors,
                    and the Bishop of Zion with his Counselors, were present with us, and received
                    their anointings under the hands of Father Smith, and this
                    was confirmed by the Presidency, and the glories of heaven were unfolded
                    to them also.
                </span></block>

                <block><span>
                    We then invited the High Councilors of Kirtland and Zion into our room,
                    and President Hyrum Smith anointed the head of the President of the Councilors
                    in Kirtland, and
                    President David Whitmer the head of the President of the Councilors of
                    Zion. The President of each quorum then anointed the heads of his colleagues,
                    each in his turn, beginning at the oldest.
                </span></block>

                <block><span>
                    The visions of heaven were opened to them also. Some of them saw the face
                    of the Savior, and others were ministered unto by holy angels, and the
                    spirit of prophecy and revelation was poured out in mighty power; and loud
                    hosannas, and glory to God in the highest,
                    saluted the heavens, for we all communed with the heavenly host. And I
                    saw in my vision all of the Presidency in the celestial kingdom of God,
                    and many others that were present.

        In the evening met the quorum of High Priests, in the west room of the
        upper loft of the Lord's house, and, in company with my counselors,
        consecrated and anointed the
        counselors of the presidents of the High Priests' quorum, and, having
        instructed them and set the quorum in order, I left them to perform the
        holy anointing, and went to the
        quorum of Elders at the other end of the room. I assisted in anointing
        the counselors of the president of the Elders, and gave the instruction
        necessary for the occasion, and left the
        president and his counselors to anoint the Elders while I should go to
        the adjoining room, and attend to organizing and instructing the quorum
        of the Seventy.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        I found the Twelve Apostles assembled with this quorum, and I proceeded,
        with the quorum of the Presidency, to instruct them, and also the seven
        presidents of the Seventy Elders, to call upon God with up-lifted hands,
        to seal the blessings which had been promised to them by the holy anointing.
        As I organized this quorum, with the presidency in this room, President
        Sylvester Smith saw a pillar of fire rest down and abide upon the heads
        of the quorum, as we stood in the midst of the Twelve.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        When the Twelve and the seven presidents were through with their sealing
        prayer, I
        called upon President Sidney Rigdon to seal them with uplifted hands;
        and when he had done this, and cried Hosanna, that all the congregation
        should join him, and shout Hosanna to God and the Lamb, and glory to God
        in the highest. It was done so, and Elder Roger Orton saw a mighty angel
        riding upon a horse of fire, with a flaming sword in his hand, followed
        by five others, encircle the house, and protect the Saints, even the Lord's
        anointed, from the power of Satan and a host of evil spirits, which were
        striving to disturb the Saints.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        President William Smith, one of the Twelve, saw the heavens opened, and
        the Lord's host protecting the Lord's anointed.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        President Zebedee Coltrin, one of the seven presidents of the Seventy,
        saw the Savior extended before him, as upon the cross, and a little after,
        crowned with glory upon his head above the brightness of the sun.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        After these things were over, and a glorious vision which I saw had passed,
        I instructed the seven presidents to proceed and anoint the Seventy, and
        returned to the room of the High Priests and Elders, and attended to the
        sealing of what they had done, with up-lifted hands.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        After these quorums were dismissed, I retired to my home, filled with
        the Spirit, and my soul cried Hosanna to God and the Lamb, through the
        silent watches of the night; and
        while my eyes were closed in sleep, the visions of the Lord were sweet
        unto me, and His glory was round about me.</span><break></break><span>Praise the Lord.

                <italic><span>Messenger and Advocate</span></italic><span>: Previous notice having been given, the Church of the Latter Day Saints met
                this day in the House of the Lord to dedicate it to him. The congregation began to assemble before 8
                o’clock A. M. and thronged the doors until 9, when the Presidents of the church who assisted in seating
                the congregation, were reluctantly compelled to order the door-keepers to close the doors; every seat
                and aisle were crowded. One thousand persons were now silently and solemnly waiting to hear the
                word of the Lord from the mouth of his servants in the sacred desk. President Sidney Rigdon began the
                services of the day, by reading the 96</span><superscript><span>th</span></superscript><span>
                and 24</span><superscript><span>th</span></superscript><span>
                Psalms…The speaker (S. Rigdon,) selected the 8</span><superscript><span>th</span></superscript><span>
                chapter of Matthew, the 18, 19 and 20</span><superscript><span>th</span></superscript><span>
                verses from which he proposed to address the congregation,
                confining himself more closely to the 20</span><superscript><span>th</span></superscript><span>
                verse. He spoke two hours and a half in his usual, forcible
                and logical manner…President J. Smith Jr. then addressed the congregation in a manner calculated to
                instruct the understanding, rather than please the ear. He then offered the dedication prayer, which
                was as follows:

        cloven tongues as of fire, and the interpretation thereof.

        of thy saints for all
        those judgments thou art about to send, in thy wrath, upon the inhabitants
        of the earth, because of their transgressions, that thy people may not
        faint in the day of trouble.

        receive their testimony, let thy peace and thy salvation be upon that city;

        people of that city receive not the testimony of thy servants, and thy
        servants warn them to save themselves from this untoward generation, let
        it be upon that city according to that which thou hast spoken by the mouths
        of thy prophets.
        </span><verse>42</verse><span>But deliver thou, O

        from their blood.

        assisting them, “Thy will be done, O Lord, and not ours.”
        </span><verse>45</verse><span>We know that thou hast spoken by the mouth of thy prophets terrible things

        </span><verse>48</verse><span>Thou knowest, O Lord, that they have been greatly oppressed and afflicted
        by wicked men; and our hearts flow out with sorrow because of their grievous
        burdens.
        </span><verse>49</verse><span>O Lord, how long wilt thou suffer this people to bear this affliction,
        and the cries of their innocent ones to ascend up in thine ears, and their
        blood come up in testimony before thee, and not make a display of thy testimony
        in their behalf?

                HC: Joseph Smith attended meeting in the Lord’s House, assisted the other Presidents of the Church in
                seating the congregation and then became an attentive listener to the preaching from the stand... In
                the PM he assisted the other Presidents in distributing the elements of the Lord’s Supper to the
                church, receiving them from the hands [of the] “Twelve” whose privilege it was to officiate in the
                sacred desk this day. After having performed this service to his brethren, he retired to the pulpit, the
                veils being dropped, and bowed himself with Oliver Cowdery, in solemn, but silent prayer to the Most
                High. After rising from prayer the following vision was opened to both of them.

                On July 25, 1836, Joseph Smith, Hyrum Smith, Oliver Cowdery, and Sidney Rigdon left Kirtland, Ohio, to
                travel to the eastern United States, briefly visiting New York City and Boston and staying in Salem,
                Massachusetts, before returning to Kirtland in mid-September. They arrived in Salem on August 5 and
                rented a house for three weeks.

                On April 6, 1837 a solemn assembly was held in the House of the Lord in Kirtland. During this meeting
                Joseph Smith corrected an error in calling presidents of the Seventy. D&amp;C 107:97 requires that
                presidents be chosen from among the Seventy, whereas several of the presidents had been chosen
                from the Elders quorum. When that was done, those Elders had the High Priesthood conferred upon
                them, in addition to being ordained and set apart to the office of President.

        It was ascertained that all but one or two of the presidents of the Seventies
        were High
        Priests, and when they had ordained and set apart any from the quorums
        of Elders into the quorum of Seventies, they had conferred upon them the
        High Priesthood also. This was
        declared to be wrong, and not according to the order of heaven. New Presidents
        of the Seventies were accordingly ordained to fill the places of such of
        them as were High
        Priests, and the ex-officio presidents and such of the Seventies as had
        been legally ordained to be High Priests were directed to unite with the
        High Priests’ quorum.

                Of the condition of affairs in Kirtland at this time Eliza Snow wrote: “ A spirit of speculation had crept
                into the hearts of some of the Twelve, and nearly, if not every quorum was more or less infected. Most
                of the Saints were poor, and now prosperity was dawning upon them—the Temple was completed and
                in it they had been recipients of marvelous blessings, and many who had been humble and faithful to
                the performance of every duty—ready to go and come at every call of the Priesthood, were getting
                haughty in their spirits, and lifted up in the pride of their hearts. As the Saints drank in the love and
                spirit of the world, the Spirit of the Lord withdrew from their hearts, and they were filled with pride
                and hatred toward those who maintained their integrity.”
            </span></block>

            <block><span>
                HC: At this time the spirit of speculation in lands and property of all kinds, which was so prevalent
                throughout the whole nation, was taking deep root in the church. As the fruits of this spirit, evil
                surmisings, fault-finding, disunion, dissension, and apostasy followed in quick succession, and it
                seemed as though all the powers of earth and hell were combining their influence in an especial manner to overthrow the church at once, and make a final end. Other banking institutions refused the
                “Kirtland Safety Society’s” notes. The enemy abroad, and apostates in our midst, united in their
                schemes, flour and provisions were turned towards other markets, and many became disaffected
                toward me as though I were the sole cause of those very evils I was most strenuously striving against,
                and which were actually brought upon us by the brethren not giving heed to my counsel.

        No quorum in the Church was entirely exempt from the influence of those
        false spirits who are striving against me for the mastery; even some of
        the Twelve were so far lost to their high and responsible calling, as to
        begin to take sides, secretly, with the enemy. In
        this state of things, and but a few weeks before the Twelve were expecting
        to meet in full quorum (some of them having been absent for some time),
        God revealed to me that something new must be done for the salvation of

        foreign mission of the Church of Christ in the last days.

                HC A new year dawned upon the Church in Kirtland in all the bitterness of the spirit of apostate
                mobocracy; which continued to rage and grow hotter and hotter, until Elder Rigdon and myself were
                obliged to flee from its deadly influence, as did the Apostles and Prophets of old, and as Jesus said,
                “when they persecute you in one city, flee to another.” On the evening of the 12th of January, about
                ten o’clock, we left Kirtland, on horseback, to escape mob violence, which was about to burst upon us
                under the color of legal process to cover the hellish designs of our enemies, and to save themselves
                from the just judgment of the law.
            </span></block>

            <block><span>
                We continued our travels during the night, and at eight o’clock on the morning of the 13th, arrived
                among the brethren in Norton Township, Medina county, Ohio, a distance of sixty miles from Kirtland.
                Here we tarried about thirty-six hours, when our families arrived; and on the 16th we pursued our
                journey with our families, in covered wagons towards the city of Far West, in Missouri. We passed
                through Dayton and Eaton, in Ohio, and Dublin, Indiana; in the latter place we tarried nine days, and
                refreshed ourselves.

                Sometime in March 1838, Joseph apparently answered a series of questions regarding the prophecies
                in Isaiah chapters 11 and 52. The questions and answers were inscribed in Joseph’s “Scriptory Book” by
                George Robinson. No authorship was attributed, although some of the answers begin with “thus saith
                the Lord.” Joseph Smith’s authorship is implied.

                In early 1838, Thomas Marsh and David Patten arrived in Far West, released the presidency, and
                installed themselves along with Brigham Young as the new presidency of Zion. One week after being
                sustained as the new presidency, they proceeded to excommunicate Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer,
                John Whitmer, William Phelps, and others. As members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, Marsh,
                Patten, and Young were expected to travel, proselytize, and supervise the church conferences and
                branches outside of Zion and its stakes—that is, outside of the main church congregation in Missouri
                and any other places designated for gathering. After arriving in Far West, Joseph dictated this
                revelation to David Patten.

                In early 1837, about a year before Joseph’s arrival, Zion presidency members William W. Phelps and
                John Whitmer drew up a plan for a house unto the Lord and appointed a committee to oversee
                construction. In April 1837, the high council questioned the Zion presidency’s authority to appoint such
                a committee and even to select the site for the city. When Joseph and Sidney Rigdon visited Far West
                in November, they participated in a council meeting in which the members resolved to suspend any
                construction work “till the Lord shall reveal it to be his will to be commenced.”

            <block><span>
                After Joseph moved Far West in March 1838, he and the high council turned their attention to
                developing Far West as the church’s gathering center. By this time, thousands of Saints were living in
                Far West and its vicinity and hundreds more were expected from Kirtland within the next few months.

                Following Joseph’s departure from Kirtland in January 1838, Williams Marks was designated to preside
                over the church there and to act as a financial agent for Joseph and Sidney Rigdon in arranging
                payment of their debts. Newel Whitney was the bishop in Kirtland, overseeing the temporal operations
                of the church there. It was apparently expected that Marks and Whitney would quickly settle the
                church’s affairs and then move to Missouri in accordance with the January 12, 1838 revelation
                directing faithful Saints to relocate there. Yet, neither Whitney nor Marks departed Kirtland with the
                large group of Saints that left Kirtland on July 6.

        Let them settle up their business speedily and journey from the land of
        Kirtland, before I, the Lord, send again the snows upon the earth.
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>Let them awake, and arise, and come forth, and not tarry, for I, the Lord,
        command it.

        </span><verse>4</verse><span>Let them repent of all their sins, and of all their covetous desires,

        </span><verse>5</verse><span>Let the properties of
        Kirtland be turned out for debts, saith the Lord. Let them go, saith the
        Lord, and whatsoever remaineth, let it remain in your hands, saith the
        Lord.

        <verse>6</verse><span>For have I not the fowls of heaven, and also the fish of the sea, and
        the beasts of the
        mountains? Have I not made the earth? Do I not hold the destinies of all
        the armies of the nations of the earth?
        </span><verse>7</verse><span>Therefore, will I not make solitary places to bud and to blossom, and
        to bring forth in abundance? saith the Lord.
        </span><verse>8</verse><span>Is there not room enough on the mountains of Adam-ondi-Ahman, and on the
        plains of Olaha Shinehah, or the land where Adam
        dwelt, that you should covet that which is but the drop, and neglect the
        more weighty matters?
        </span><verse>9</verse><span>Therefore, come up hither unto the land of my people, even Zion.
    </span></block>

        <verse>10</verse><span>Let my servant William Marks be faithful over a few things, and he shall
        be a ruler over many. Let him preside in the midst of my people in the

        a bishop unto my people, saith the Lord, not in name but in deed, saith
        the Lord.

        to generation, forever and ever, saith the Lord.
        </span><verse>13</verse><span>Therefore, let him contend earnestly for the redemption of the First Presidency
        of my Church, saith the Lord; and when he falls he shall rise again, for
        his sacrifice shall be more sacred unto me than his increase, saith the
        Lord.
        </span><verse>14</verse><span>Therefore, let him come up hither speedily, unto the land of Zion; and
        in the due time he shall be made a merchant unto my name, saith the Lord,

                D&amp;C 42 directed the church to consecrate their property to the bishop and then manage stewardships
                assigned to them. Church members attempted to follow this program of consecration and stewardship
                in Jackson County, Missouri, but their attempts ended when they were driven out of the county in
                1833. In September 1837, Bishop Newel Whitney and his counselors in Kirtland called on members
                everywhere to “bring their tithes into the store house” to relieve church debts and to help establish
                the community of Saints in Missouri.

                On June 17, Sidney Rigdon delivered what came to be known as the Salt Sermon. Without naming
                individuals, he denounced dissenters as salt that had lost its savor and that they must now be trodden under foot.
            </span></block>

            <block><span>
                On July 4, Sidney Rigdon delivered a sermon in which he vowed violence on their enemies. “We take
                God and all the holy angels to witness this day, that we warn all men in the name of Jesus Christ, to
                come on us no more forever. For from this hour, we will bear it no more, our rights shall no more be
                trampled on with impunity. The man or the set of men, who attempts it, does it at the expense of their
                lives. And that mob that comes on us to disturb us; it shall be between us and them a war of
                extermination; for we will follow them till the last drop of their blood is spilled, or else they will have to
                exterminate us: for we will carry the seat of war to their own houses, and their own families, and one
                party or the other shall be utterly destroyed.”

                On August 6, around 200 Missourians gathered in Gallatin to prevent Mormons from voting in that
                day’s election. A short skirmish ensued, but concluded without any loss of life.
            </span></block>

            <block><span>
                On September 20, about 150 armed men rode into DeWitt and demanded that all Mormons leave the
                county within ten days. On October 1, the Missourians cut off DeWitt from outside supplies. On
                October 11, the Mormons agreed to move to Caldwell County.
            </span></block>

            <block><span>
                In mid-October, Mormon militias retaliated by plundering houses and stores, burning buildings, and
                driving non-member women and children into the snowy night. John Corrill wrote, “the love of pillage
                grew upon them very fast, for they plundered every kind of property they could get a hold of.”
            </span></block>

            <block><span>
                On October 19, the day after Gallatin was burned, Thomas Marsh and Orson Hyde left the association
                of the Church. On October 24, they swore out affidavits concerning the burning and looting in Daviess
                County. They also reported the existence of the Danite group among the Mormons.
            </span></block>

            <block><span>
                On October 25, Mormon and state militias fought the Battle of Crooked River. The Mormons won the
                battle, but David Patten died from his wounds.

                Exaggerated reports of the battle combined with the n of Mormons burning and pillaging towns
                reached Governor Boggs. He mustered 2,500 troops to put down the violence. Perhaps referencing
                Rigdon’s July 4th sermon that talked of “a war of extermination,” Boggs issued Missouri Executive
                Order 44, known as the Extermination Order, on October 27, which stated that "the Mormons must be
                treated as enemies, and must be exterminated or driven from the State if necessary for the public
                peace.”

                On October 30, 250 armed men approached Haun’s Mill, where 30 to 40 Latter Day Saint families were
                living. In the ensuing battle, 17 Latter Day Saints were killed. When survivors reached Far West, the
                reports of the attack played a significant part in the decision of the Mormons to surrender.

                In response to the violence over the summer and the extermination order, the Missouri state militia
                surrounded and laid siege to Far West. The terms for surrender were: the Latter-day Saints were to

                was to sell his property to pay for the damages ; and the Mormons who had taken up arms were to

        <verse>7</verse><span>My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions
        shall be but a small moment;
        </span><verse>8</verse><span>and then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt
        triumph over all thy foes.
        </span><verse>9</verse><span>Thy friends do stand by thee, and they shall hail thee again
        with warm hearts and friendly hands.
        </span><verse>10</verse><span>Thou art not yet as Job; thy friends do not contend against thee, neither
        charge thee with transgression, as they did Job.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>11</verse><span>And they who do charge thee with transgression, their hope shall be blasted,
        and their prospects shall melt away as the hoar frost melteth before the
        burning rays of the rising sun;
        </span><verse>12</verse><span>and also that God hath set his hand and seal to change the times and seasons,
        and to blind their minds, that they may not understand his marvelous workings;
        that he may prove them also and take them in their own craftiness;
        </span><verse>13</verse><span>also because their hearts are
        corrupted, and the things which they are willing to bring upon others,
        and love to have others suffer, may come upon themselves to the very uttermost;
        </span><verse>14</verse><span>that they may be
        disappointed also, and their hopes may be cut off;
        </span><verse>15</verse><span>and not many years hence, that they and their posterity shall be swept
        from under heaven, saith God, that not one of them is left to stand by
        the wall.

        saith the Lord, and cry they have sinned when they have not sinned before
        me, saith the Lord, but have done that which was meet in mine eyes, and
        which I commanded them.
        </span><verse>17</verse><span>But those who cry
        transgression do it because they are the servants of sin, and are the
        children of disobedience themselves.
        </span><verse>18</verse><span>And those who swear falsely against my servants, that they might bring
        them into bondage and death—
        </span><verse>19</verse><span>wo unto them; because they have offended my little ones they shall be
        severed from the ordinances of mine house.
        </span><verse>20</verse><span>Their basket shall not be full, their houses and their barns shall perish,
        and they themselves shall be despised by those that
        flattered them.
        </span><verse>21</verse><span>They shall not have right to the priesthood, nor their posterity after
        them from generation to generation.
        </span><verse>22</verse><span>It had been better for them that a millstone had been hanged about their
        necks, and they drowned in the depth of the sea.
        </span><verse>23</verse><span>Wo unto all those that discomfort my people, and drive, and murder, and
        testify against them, says the Lord of Hosts; a generation of vipers shall
        not escape the damnation of hell.
        </span><verse>24</verse><span>Behold, mine eyes see and know all their works, and I have in reserve
        a swift judgment in the season thereof, for them all;
        </span><verse>25</verse><span>for there is a time appointed for every man, according as his works shall

        </span><verse>28</verse><span>a time to come in the which nothing shall be withheld, whether there be

        laws, and set times, shall be revealed in the days of the dispensation
        of the fulness of times—
        </span><verse>32</verse><span>according to that which was ordained in the midst of the Council of the
        Eternal God of all other gods before this world was, that should be reserved
        unto the finishing and the end thereof, when every man shall enter into
        his eternal presence and into his immortal rest.

        <verse>1</verse><span>And again, we would suggest for your consideration the propriety of all
        the saints
        gathering up a knowledge of all the facts, and sufferings and abuses put
        upon them by the people of this State;
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>and also of all the property and amount of damages which they have sustained,
        both of character and personal injuries, as well as real property;
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>and also the names of all persons that have had a hand in their oppressions,
        as far as they can get hold of them and find them out.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>4</verse><span>And perhaps a committee can be appointed to find out these things, and
        to take statements and affidavits; and also to gather up the libelous publications
        that are afloat;
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>and all that are in the magazines, and in the encyclopedias, and all the
        libelous histories that are published, and are writing, and by whom, and
        present the whole concatenation of diabolical rascality and nefarious and
        murderous impositions that have been practiced
        upon this people—
        </span><verse>6</verse><span>that we may not only publish to all the world, but present them to the
        heads of government in all their dark and hellish hue, as the last effort
        which is enjoined on us by our Heavenly Father, before we can fully and
        completely claim that promise
        which shall call him forth from his hiding place; and also that the whole
        nation may be left without excuse before he can send forth the power of
        his mighty arm.

    <block>
        <verse>7</verse><span>It is an imperative duty that we owe to God, to angels, with whom we shall
        be brought to stand, and also to ourselves, to our wives and children,
        who have been made to bow down with grief, sorrow, and care, under the
        most damning hand of murder, tyranny, and oppression, supported and urged
        on and upheld by the influence of that spirit which hath so strongly riveted
        the creeds of the fathers, who have inherited lies, upon the hearts of
        the children, and filled the world with confusion, and has been growing
        stronger and stronger, and is now the very mainspring of all corruption,
        and the whole earth groans under the
        weight of its iniquity.
        </span><verse>8</verse><span>It is an iron yoke, it is a strong band; they are the very handcuffs,
        and chains, and shackles, and fetters of hell.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>9</verse><span>Therefore it is an imperative duty that we owe, not only to our own wives
        and children, but to the widows and fatherless, whose husbands and fathers
        have been murdered under its iron hand;
        </span><verse>10</verse><span>which dark and blackening deeds are enough to make hell itself shudder,
        and to stand aghast and pale, and the hands of the very devil to tremble
        and palsy.
        &gt;
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>11</verse><span>And also it is an imperative duty that we owe to all the rising generation,
        and to all the pure in heart—
        </span><verse>12</verse><span>for there are many yet on the earth among all sects, parties, and
        denominations, who are blinded by the subtle craftiness of men, whereby
        they lie in wait to deceive, and who are only kept from the truth because
        they know not where to find it.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>13</verse><span>Therefore, that we should waste and wear out our lives in bringing to
        light all the hidden things of darkness, wherein we know them; and they
        are truly manifest from heaven—
        </span><verse>14</verse><span>these should then be attended to with great earnestness.
        </span><verse>15</verse><span>Let no man count them as
        small things; for there is much which lieth in futurity, pertaining to
        the saints, which depends upon these things.

    <block>
        <verse>16</verse><span>You know, brethren, that a very large ship is benefited very much by a
        very small helm in the time of a storm, by being kept workways with the
        wind and the waves.
        </span><verse>17</verse><span>Therefore, dearly beloved brethren, let us cheerfully do all things that
        lie in our power; and then may we stand still, with the utmost assurance,
        to see the salvation of God, and for his arm to be revealed.

                Hyrum Smith declared that it was “not expedient to go into the law of consecration under Existing
                circumstances”, but the high council refused to rescind its resolution.

        He said that the law of consecration could not be kept here, and that
        it was the will of the Lord that we should desist from trying to keep it,
        and if persisted in it would produce a perfect abortion, and that he assumed
        the whole responsibility of not keeping it until proposed by himself.

        Afterwards read the parable of the twelve olive trees and said, speaking
        of the Land of Zion, it consists of all North and South America, but that
        any place where the Saints gather is Zion, which every righteous man will
        build up for a place of safety for his
        children. The olive trees are twelve stakes which are yet to be built,
        not the Temple in Jackson as some suppose. For while the twelve stakes
        are being built we will be at peace but the nations of the Earth will be
        at war…
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        The redemption of Zion is the redemption of all North and South America
        and those 12 stake must be built up before the redemption of Zion can take
        place. And those who
        refuse to gather and build when they are commanded to do so cease to be
        saviors of men, and are thenceforth good for nothing but shall be cast
        out and trodden under feet of men…
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        We shall build the Zion of the Lord in peace until the servants of that
        Lord shall begin to lay the foundation of a great and high watch tower
        and then shall they begin to say within themselves, “What need hath my
        Lord of this tower seeing this is a time of peace? Etc.”
        Then the enemy shall come as a thief in the night and scatter the servants
        abroad. They will wake up the nations of the whole earth. Even this nation
        will be on the very verge of crumbling to pieces and tumbling to the ground.
        And when the constitution is upon the brink of ruin, this people will be
        the staff upon which the nation shall lean and they shall bear the Constitution
        away from the very verge of destruction.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Then shall the Lord say:
        </span><quote><span>
            Go tell all my servants who are the strength of mine house, my young men
            and middle aged, etc., “Come to the land of my vineyard and fight the battle
            of the Lord.” Then the kings and queens shall come, then the rulers of the earth
            shall come, then shall all saints come. Yea, the foreign saints shall come to fight
            for the land of my vineyard. For in this thing shall be their safety, and
            they will have no power to choose, but will come as a man fleeth from a
            sudden destruction.

        But before this the time shall be, these who are now my friends shall
        become my enemies and shall seek to take my life. And there are those now
        before me who will more furiously pursue me, more diligently seek my life,
        and be more blood thirsty upon my track than
        ever were the Missouri Mobbers…
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        And I prophecy in the name of the Lord that the state of Illinois shall
        become a great and mighty mountain, as a city set upon a hill that cannot
        be hid, and a great candle that
        giveth light to the world. And the city of Nauvoo also shall become the
        greatest city in the whole world.

        Proclamation to all the nations of the world
    </span></heading>

    <block>
        <verse>2</verse><span>Your prayers are acceptable before me; and in answer to them I say unto
        you, that you
        are now called immediately to make a solemn proclamation of my gospel,
        and of this stake which I have planted to be a cornerstone of Zion, which
        shall be polished with the
        refinement which is after the similitude of a palace.
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>This proclamation shall be made to all the kings of the world, to the
        four corners thereof, to the honorable president-elect, and the high-minded
        governors of the nation in which you live, and to all the nations of the
        earth scattered abroad.
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>Let it be written in the spirit of meekness and by the power of the Holy
        Ghost, which shall be in you at the time of the writing of the same;
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>for it shall be given you by the Holy Ghost to know my will concerning
        those kings and authorities,
        even what shall befall them in a time to come.
        </span><verse>6</verse><span>For, behold, I am about to call upon them to give heed to the light and
        glory of Zion, for the set time has come to favor her.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>7</verse><span>Call ye, therefore, upon them with loud proclamation, and with your testimony,
        fearing them not, for they are as grass, and all their glory as the flower
        thereof which soon falleth, that they may be left also without excuse—
        </span><verse>8</verse><span>and that I may visit them in the day of
        visitation, when I shall unveil the face of my covering, to appoint the
        portion of the oppressor among hypocrites, where there is gnashing of teeth,
        if they reject my servants
        and my testimony which I have revealed unto them.
        </span><verse>9</verse><span>And again, I will visit and soften their hearts, many of them for your
        good, that ye may find grace in their eyes, that they may come to the light
        of truth, and the Gentiles to the exaltation or lifting up of Zion.
        </span><verse>10</verse><span>For the day of my visitation cometh speedily, in an hour when ye think
        not of; and
        where shall be the safety of my people, and refuge for those who shall
        be left of them?
        </span><verse>11</verse><span>Awake, O kings of the earth! Come ye, O, come ye, with your gold and your
        silver, to the help of my people, to the house of the daughters of Zion.

        you to write this proclamation, for I am well pleased with him, and that
        he should be with you;
        </span><verse>13</verse><span>let him, therefore, hearken to your counsel, and I will bless him with
        a multiplicity of
        blessings; let him be faithful and true in all things from henceforth,

        he loveth that which is right before me, saith the Lord.

        <verse>16</verse><span>Again, let my servant John C. Bennett help you in your labor in sending
        my word to the kings and people of the earth, and stand by you, even you
        my servant Joseph Smith, in the hour of affliction; and his reward shall
        not fail if he receive counsel.
        </span><verse>17</verse><span>And for his love he shall be great, for he shall be mine if he do this,
        saith the Lord. I have seen the work which he hath done, which I accept

        me before the world; and I will bear him up as on eagles’ wings; and he
        shall beget glory and honor to himself and unto my name.
        </span><verse>19</verse><span>That when he shall finish his work I may receive him unto myself, even
        as I did my servant David Patten, who is with me at this time, and also
        my servant Edward Partridge, and also my aged servant Joseph Smith, Sen.,

        <verse>20</verse><span>And again, verily I say unto you, my servant George Miller is without

        </span><verse>21</verse><span>I therefore say unto you, I seal upon his head the office of a bishopric,
        like unto my servant Edward Partridge, that he may receive the consecrations
        of mine house, that he may administer blessings upon the heads of the poor
        of my people, saith the Lord. Let no man despise my servant George, for

        </span><verse>23</verse><span>And it shall be for a house for boarding, a house that strangers may come

        he shall contemplate the word of the Lord; and the cornerstone I have appointed
        for Zion.
        </span><verse>24</verse><span>This house shall be a healthful habitation if it be built unto my name,

        may be baptized for those who are dead—
        </span><verse>30</verse><span>for this ordinance belongeth to my house, and cannot be acceptable to

        </span><verse>32</verse><span>But behold, at the end of this appointment your baptisms for your dead
        shall not be acceptable unto me; and if you do not these things at the
        end of the appointment ye shall be rejected as a church, with your dead,
        saith the Lord your God.
        </span><verse>33</verse><span>For verily I say unto you, that after you have had sufficient time to
        build a house to me, wherein the ordinance of baptizing for the dead belongeth,
        and for which the same was
        instituted from before the foundation of the world, your baptisms for
        your dead cannot be acceptable unto me;

        </span><verse>35</verse><span>And after this time, your baptisms for the dead, by those
        who are scattered abroad, are not acceptable unto me, saith the Lord.
        </span><verse>36</verse><span>For it is ordained that in Zion, and in her stakes, and in Jerusalem,
        those places which I have appointed for refuge, shall be the places for

        </span><verse>38</verse><span>For, for this cause I commanded Moses that he should build a tabernacle,
        that they should bear it with them in the wilderness, and to build a house
        in the land of promise, that those ordinances might be revealed which had
        been hid from before the world was.

        of Levi, and for your oracles in your most holy places wherein you receive
        conversations, and your statutes and judgments, for the beginning of the
        revelations and foundation of Zion, and for the glory, honor, and endowment

        it, for
        that is the spot which I have chosen for you to build it.

        unto you, neither fulfil the promises which ye expect at my hands, saith
        the Lord.
        </span><verse>48</verse><span>For instead of blessings, ye, by your own works, bring
        cursings, wrath, indignation, and judgments upon your own heads, by your
        follies, and by all your abominations, which you practice before me, saith
        the Lord.

        with all their might and with all they have to perform that work, and cease
        not their diligence, and their enemies come upon them and hinder them from
        performing that work, behold, it behooveth me to

        </span><verse>51</verse><span>Therefore, for this cause have I accepted the offerings of those whom
        I commanded to build up a city and a house unto my name, in Jackson county,
        Missouri, and were hindered by their enemies, saith the Lord your God.
        </span><verse>52</verse><span>And I will answer judgment, wrath, and indignation, wailing, and anguish,

                HC: President Joseph Smith, by request of the Twelve Apostles, gave instructions on the doctrine of
                baptism for the dead, which were listened to with intense interest by the large assembly. The
                dispensation of the fullness of times will bring to light the things that have been revealed in all former
                dispensations; also other things that have not been before revealed. He shall send Elijah the Prophet,
                and restore all things in Christ. President Joseph Smith then announced: There shall be no more
                baptisms for the dead, until the ordinance can be attended to in the Lord’s House; and the Church shall
                not hold another General Conference, until they can meet in said house. For thus saith the Lord!
            </span></block>

            <block><span>
                In a letter from November 1851, Lyman Wight wrote: The church mostly went from there, Kirtland
                Ohio, to Missouri where they commenced another house, from which they were driven to the State of
                Illinois, where we were commanded to build a house or temple to the Most High God. We were to
                have a sufficient time to build that house, during which time our baptisms for our dead should be
                acceptable in the river. If we did not build within this time we were to be rejected as a church, we and
                our dead together. Both the temple and baptizing went very leisurely till the temple was somewhere in
                building the second story, when Brother Joseph from the stand announced the alarming declaration
                that baptism for our dead was no longer acceptable in the river. As much to say the time for building
                the temple had passed by and both we and our dead were rejected together. The church now stands
                rejected together with their dead. The church being rejected now stands alienated from her God in
                every sense of the word.

        All the saints that dwell in that land are commanded to come away, for
        this is, “Thus saith the Lord;” therefore pay out no moneys nor properties
        for houses, nor lands, in that
        country, for if you do, you will lose them; for the time shall come that
        you shall not possess them in peace; but shall be scourged with a sore
        scourge; yet your children may possess them; but not until many years shall
        pass away. And as to the organization of that branch of the church, it
        is not according to the spirit and will of God. And as to the
        designs of the leading members of that branch, relative to the printing
        press, and the
        ordaining of Elders, and sending out Elders to beg for the poor, are not
        according to the will of God. And in these things they shall not prosper,
        for they have neglected the House of the Lord, the Baptismal Font, in this
        place, wherein their dead may be redeemed, and the key of knowledge that
        unfolds the dispensation of the fullness of times may be turned,
        and the mysteries of God be unfolded, upon which their salvation, and
        the salvation of the world, and the redemption of their dead depends, for
        thus saith the Lord, “There shall not be a general assembly for a general
        conference assembled together until the House of the Lord shall be finished,
        and the baptismal font;” and if we are not diligent, “the church shall
        be rejected, and their dead also,” saith the Lord.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Therefore, dear brother, any proceedings otherwise than to put forth their
        hands with their might to do this work, is not according to the will of
        God, and shall not prosper. Therefore tarry not in any place whatever,
        but come forth unto this place from all the world, until it is filled up
        and polished and sanctified according to my word, saith the Lord, come
        ye forth from the ends of the earth, that I may hide you from mine
        indignation that shall scourge the wicked, and then I will send forth
        and build up
        Kirtland, and it shall be polished and refined according to my word. Therefore,
        your doings and your organizations, and designs in printing, or any of
        your councils, are not of me, saith the Lord, even so, Amen.

        We have been chastened by the hand of God heretofore for not obeying his
        commands, although we never violated any human law, or transgressed any
        human precept: yet we have treated lightly his commands, and departed from
        his ordinances, and the Lord has chastened us sore, and we have felt his
        arm, and kissed the rod: let us be wise in time to
        come, and ever remember that “to obey is better than sacrifice; and to
        hearken than the fat of rams.” The Lord has told us to build the temple,
        and the Nauvoo House, and that command is as binding upon us as any other;
        and that man who engages not in these things is as much a transgressor
        as though he broke any other command—he is not a doer of God’s will, nor
        a fulfiller of his laws.

        a small thing to me, as the envy and wrath of man have been my common lot
        all the days of my life; and for what cause it seems mysterious, unless
        I was ordained from before the foundation of the world for some good end,
        or bad, as you may choose to call it. Judge ye for yourselves. God knoweth
        all these things, whether it be good or bad. But nevertheless, deep water
        is what I am wont to swim in. It all has become a second nature to me;
        and I feel, like Paul, to glory in tribulation; for to this day has the
        God of my fathers delivered me out of them all, and will deliver me from
        henceforth; for behold, and lo, I shall triumph over all my enemies, for
        the Lord God hath spoken it.

    <block>
        <verse>1</verse><span>As I stated to you in my letter before I left my place, that I would write
        to you from time to time and give you information in relation to many subjects,
        I now resume the subject of the baptism for the dead, as that subject seems
        to occupy my mind, and press itself upon my feelings the strongest, since
        I have been pursued by my enemies.
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>I wrote a few words of revelation to you concerning a recorder. I have
        had a few additional views in relation to this matter, which I now certify.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        That is, it was declared in my former letter that there should be a recorder,
        who should be eye-witness, and also to hear with his ears, that he might
        make a record of a truth before the Lord.
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>Now, in relation to this matter, it would be very difficult for one recorder
        to be present at all times, and to do all the business. To obviate this
        difficulty, there can be a
        recorder appointed in each ward of the city, who is well qualified for
        taking accurate minutes; and let him be very particular and precise in
        taking the whole proceedings,
        certifying in his record that he saw with his eyes, and heard with his
        ears, giving the date, and names, and so forth, and the history of the
        whole transaction; naming also some three individuals that are present,
        if there be any present, who can at any time when called upon certify to
        the same, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be
        established.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>4</verse><span>Then, let there be a general recorder, to whom these other records can
        be handed, being attended with certificates over their own signatures,
        certifying that the record they have made is true. Then the general church
        recorder can enter the record on the general church book, with the certificates
        and all the attending witnesses, with his own statement that he verily
        believes the above statement and records to be true, from his knowledge
        of the general character and appointment of those men by the church. And
        when this is done on the general church book, the record shall be just
        as holy, and shall answer the ordinance just the same as if he had seen
        with his eyes and heard with his ears, and made a record of the same on
        the general church book.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>5</verse><span>You may think this order of things to be very particular; but let me tell
        you that it is only to answer the will of God, by conforming to the ordinance
        and preparation that the Lord ordained and prepared before the foundation
        of the world, for the salvation of the dead
        who should die without a knowledge of the gospel.

        <verse>6</verse><span>And further, I want you to remember that John the Revelator was contemplating
        this very subject in relation to the dead, when he declared, as you will
        find recorded in Revelation 20:12
        </span><quote>
            <reference>
                <referencenote><span>Revelation 20:12</span></referencenote><span>And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were
                opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life; and the
                dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according
                to their works.

        </quote>

    <block>
        <verse>7</verse><span>You will discover in this quotation that the books were opened; and another
        book was opened, which was the book of life; but the dead were judged out
        of those things which were written in the books, according to their works;
        consequently, the books spoken of must be the books which contained the
        record of their works, and refer to the records
        which are kept on the earth. And the book which was the book of life is
        the record which is kept in heaven; the principle agreeing precisely with
        the doctrine which is commanded you in the revelation contained in the
        letter which I wrote to you previous to my leaving my place—that in all
        your recordings it may be recorded in heaven.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>8</verse><span>Now, the nature of this ordinance consists in the power of the priesthood,
        by the
        revelation of Jesus Christ, wherein it is granted that whatsoever you
        bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever you loose on earth
        shall be loosed in heaven. Or, in other words, taking a different view
        of the translation, whatsoever you record on earth shall be recorded in
        heaven, and whatsoever you do not record on earth shall not be
        recorded in heaven; for out of the books shall your dead be judged, according
        to their own works, whether they themselves have attended to the ordinances
        in their own propria persona, or by the means of their own agents, according
        to the ordinance which God has prepared for their salvation from before
        the foundation of the world, according to the
        records which they have kept concerning their dead.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>9</verse><span>It may seem to some to be a very bold doctrine that we talk of—a power
        which records or binds on earth and binds in heaven. Nevertheless, in all
        ages of the world, whenever the Lord has given a dispensation of the priesthood
        to any man by actual revelation, or any set of men, this power has always
        been given. Hence, whatsoever those men did in authority, in the name of
        the Lord, and did it truly and faithfully, and kept a proper and faithful
        record of the same, it became a law on earth and in heaven, and could
        not be annulled, according to the decrees of the great Jehovah. This is
        a faithful saying. Who can hear it?

                give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt
                bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose
                on earth shall be loosed in heaven.

        Symbolism of baptism
    </span></heading>

    <block>
        <verse>12</verse><span>Herein is glory and honor, and immortality and eternal life—The ordinance
        of baptism by water, to be immersed therein in order to answer to the likeness
        of the dead, that one principle might accord with the other; to be immersed
        in the water and come forth out of the water is in the likeness of the
        resurrection of the dead in coming forth out of their
        graves; hence, this ordinance was instituted to form a relationship with
        the ordinance of baptism for the dead, being in likeness of the dead.
        </span><verse>13</verse><span>Consequently, the baptismal font was instituted as a similitude of the
        grave, and was commanded to be in a place underneath
        where the living are wont to assemble, to show forth the living and the
        dead, and that all things may have their likeness, and that they may accord
        one with another—that which is
        earthly conforming to that which is heavenly, as Paul hath declared, 1
        Corinthians 15:46, 47, and 48:

                and afterward that which is spiritual. The first man is of the earth, earthy;
                the second man is the Lord from heaven. As is the earthy, such are they
                also that are earthy; and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are

        And as are the records on the earth in relation to your dead, which are
        truly made out, so also are the records in heaven. This, therefore, is

        these are principles in relation to the dead and the living that cannot

        revealed in the last days, and in an especial manner this most glorious
        of all subjects belonging to the everlasting gospel, namely, the baptism

        <verse>18</verse><span>I might have rendered a plainer translation to this, but it is sufficiently
        plain to suit my purpose as it stands. It is sufficient to know, in this
        case, that the earth will be smitten with a curse unless there is a welding
        link of some kind or other between the fathers and the
        children, upon some subject or other—and behold what is that subject?

    <block><span>
        It is the baptism for the dead. For we without them cannot be made perfect;
        neither can they without us be made perfect. Neither can they nor we be
        made perfect without those who have died in the gospel also; for it is
        necessary in the ushering in of the dispensation of the fulness of times,
        which dispensation is now beginning to usher in, that a whole and complete
        and perfect union, and welding together of dispensations, and keys, and
        powers, and glories should take place, and be revealed from the days of
        Adam even to the present time. And not only this, but those things which
        never have been revealed from the
        foundation of the world, but have been kept hid from the wise and prudent,
        shall be revealed unto babes and sucklings in this, the dispensation of
        the fulness of times.

                Wilford Woodruff made notes of a discourse Joseph delivered. Several individuals, including Robert
                Foster, were promoting building projects on the hill near the temple, which was drawing labor and
                resources away from the Nauvoo House project. Lucien Woodworth was one of the two architects of
                the Nauvoo House. He was not a member at the time, and referred to himself as the pagan prophet.

        President Joseph Smith arose and addressed the meeting as a Christian
        prophet and
        addressed for about an hour much to our edification. Many remarks he made
        were plain and pointed some very applicable to Dr Robert D. Foster, which
        he afterwards
        acknowledged to be true. Joseph said the pagan prophet had prophesied
        one thing that was true, viz, that if we did not build the temple &amp;
        Nauvoo House it would prove the ruin of the place. That if we did not build
        those buildings we might as well leave the place. And that it was as necessary
        to build one as the other. And many other things were said much to the
        purpose.

        That of Melchizedek who had still greater power, even power of endless
        life, of which was our Lord Jesus Christ, which also Abraham obtained by
        the offering of his son Isaac, which was not the power of a prophet nor
        apostle nor patriarch only, but of King or Priest to God, to open the windows
        of Heaven, and pour out the peace and law of endless life to man. And no
        man can attain to the joint heirship with Jesus Christ without being
        administered to by one having the same power and authority of Melchizedek.

    <block><span>
        Paul is here treating of three different priesthoods, namely the priesthood
        of Aaron,
        Abraham, and Melchizedek. Abraham’s priesthood was of greater power than
        Levi’s, and Melchizedek’s was of greater power than that of Abraham. The
        priesthood of Levi consisted of cursings and carnal commandments and not
        of blessings.

                was once as we are now” and “we have imagined and supposed that God was God from all eternity. I will refute that idea.” Though never accepted as canon by common consent of the church, nor even
                published with the scriptures, the concepts in this discourse would become accepted as doctrine and
                redefine the very nature of God.

                Published by William Law, Wilson Law, Charles Ivins, Francis M. Higbee, Robert D. Foster, and Charles
                A. Foster, in order to “give a full, candid, and succinct statement of the FACTS AS THEY REALLY EXIST IN
                THE CITY OF NAUVOO, fearless of whose particular case the facts may apply.” After the first issue was published, Joseph Smith and the city council ordered the destruction of the printing press.

                Joseph Smith, Sr., gave his last recorded patriarchal blessing to Robert D. Foster on July 20, 1840. The
                blessing promised, “thy enemies will rage, and persecute thee, and foam out their own shame, and
                shall see the error of their ways, and be constrained to acknowledge their error, and thy truth…thy
                name is written in heaven, and enrolled amongst the sanctified, thou shall be one of the hundred and
                forty and four thousand.”

                        We all verily believe, and many of us know of a surety, that the religion
                        of the Latter Day Saints, as originally taught by Joseph Smith, which is
                        contained in the OLD AND NEW TESTAMENTS, BOOK OF COVENANTS, and
                        Book of Mormon,
                        is verily true; and that the pure principles set forth in those books,
                        are the immutable and eternal principles of Heaven, and speaks a language
                        which, when spoken in truth and virtue, sinks deep into the heart of every
                        honest man. Its precepts are invigorating, and in every sense of the
                        word, tend to dignify and ennoble man's conceptions of God and his
                        attributes…
                    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        We are earnestly seeking to explode the vicious principles of Joseph Smith,
        and those who practice the same abominations and whoredoms; which we verily
        know are not accordant and consonant with the principles of Jesus Christ
        and the Apostles; and for that purpose, and with that end in view, with
        an eye single to the glory of God, we have dared to gird on the armor,
        and with God at our head, we most solemnly and sincerely declare that the
        sword of truth shall not depart from the thigh, nor the buckler from the
        arm, until we can enjoy those glorious privileges which nature's God
        and our country's laws have guaranteed to us-freedom of speech, the
        liberty of the press, and the right to worship God as seemeth us good.
        We are aware, however, that we are hazarding every earthly blessing, particularly
        property, and probably life itself, in striking this blow at tyranny and
        oppression: yet notwithstanding we most solemnly declare that no man, or
        set of men combined, shall,
        with impunity, violate obligations as sacred as many which have been violated
        unless reason, justice and virtue have become ashamed and sought the haunts
        of the grave, though our lives be the forfeiture.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Many of us have sought a reformation in the church, without a public exposition
        of the enormities of crimes practiced by its leaders, thinking that if
        they would hearken to counsel, and shew fruit meet for repentance, it would
        be as acceptable with God, as
        though they were exposed to public gaze…but our petitions were treated
        with contempt; and in many cases the petitioner spurned from their presence
        and particularly by Joseph, who would state that if he had sinned, and
        was guilty of the charges we would charge him with, he would not make acknowledgment,
        but would rather be damned; for it would
        detract from his dignity, and would consequently ruin and prove the overthrow
        of the Church…
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        It is absurd for men to assert that all is well, while wicked and corrupt
        men are seeking our destruction, by a perversion of sacred things; for
        all is not well, while whoredoms and all
        manner of abominations are practiced under the cloak of religion. Lo!
        the wolf is in the fold, arrayed in sheep's clothing, and is spreading
        death and devastation among the saints: and we say to the watchmen standing
        upon the walls, cry aloud and spare not, for the day of the Lord is at
        hand…

    <block><span>
        Resolved 1</span><superscript><span>st</span></superscript>
        <bold><span>—</span></bold><span>
        That we will not encourage the acts of any court in this church, for the
        trial of any of its members, which will not suffer the accused to be present
        and plead their own cause; we therefore declare our decided disapprobation
        to the course pursued last
        Thursday evening, in the case of William and Wilson Law, and Mrs. William
        Law, and
        R.D. Foster, as being unjust and unauthorized by the laws of the Church,
        and consequently null and void; for our law judgeth no man unless he be
        heard; and to all
        those who approbate a course so unwarranted, unprecedented and so unjust,
        we would say beware lest the unjust measure you meet to your brethren,
        be again meeted out to you.

        <bold><span>—</span></bold><span>
        Inasmuch…as they have introduced false and damnable doctrines into the
        Church, such as a plurality of gods above the God of this universe and
        his ability to fall with all his creations; the plurality of wives, for
        time and eternity; the doctrine of
        unconditional sealing up to eternal life, against all crimes except that
        of shedding innocent blood, by a perversion of their priestly authority
        and thereby forfeiting the holy
        priesthood…we therefore are constrained to denounce them as apostates
        from the pure and holy doctrines of Jesus Christ.

        That we disapprobate and discountenance every attempt to unite church
        and state; and that we further believe the effort now being made by Joseph
        Smith for political power and influence, is not commendable in the sight
        of God.

        Resolved 4</span><superscript><span>th</span></superscript>
        <bold><span>—</span></bold><span>
        That the hostile spirit and conduct manifested by Joseph Smith, and many
        of his associates towards Missouri and others inimical to his purposes,
        are decidedly at
        variance with the true spirit of Christianity, and should not be encouraged
        by any people, much less by those professing to be the ministers of the
        gospel of peace.
    </span></block>

        Resolved 5</span><superscript><span>th</span></superscript>
        <bold><span>—</span></bold><span>
        that while we disapprobate malicious persecutions and prosecutions, we
        hold that all church members are alike amenable to the laws of the land;
        and that we
        further discountenance any chicanery to screen them from the just demands
        of the same.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Resolved 6</span><superscript><span>th</span></superscript>
        <bold><span>—</span></bold><span>
        That we consider the religious influence exercised in financial concerns
        by Joseph Smith, as unjust as it is unwarranted, for the Book of
        Doctrine And Covenants
        makes it the duty of the Bishop to take charge of the financial affairs
        of the Church, and of all temporal matters pertaining to the same.
    </span></block>

        Resolved 7</span><superscript><span>th</span></superscript>
        <bold><span>—</span></bold><span>
        That we discountenance and disapprobate the attendance at houses of
        reveling and dancing; dram-shops and theatres; verily believing they have
        a tendency to lead from paths of virtue and holiness, to those of vice
        and debauchery.

        Resolved 8</span><superscript><span>th</span></superscript>
        <bold><span>—</span></bold><span>
        That we look upon the pure and holy doctrines set forth in the Scriptures
        of Divine truth, as being the immutable doctrines of salvation; and he
        who abideth in them shall be saved, and he who abideth not in them cannot
        inherit the Kingdom of Heaven.

    <block><span>
        Resolved 9</span><superscript><span>th</span></superscript>
        <bold><span>—</span></bold><span>
        That we consider the gathering in haste, and by sacrifice, to be contrary
        to the will of God; and that it has been taught by Joseph Smith and others
        for the purpose of enabling them to sell property at most exorbitant prices,
        not regarding the welfare of the church, but through their covetousness
        reducing those who had the means to give employment to the poor, to the
        necessity of seeking labor for themselves; and thus the
        wealth which is brought into the place is swallowed up by the one great
        throat, from
        whence there is no return, which if it had been economically disbursed
        amongst the whole would have rendered all comfortable.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Resolved 10</span><superscript><span>th</span></superscript>
        <bold><span>—</span></bold><span>
        That, notwithstanding our extensive acquaintance with the financial affairs
        of the Church, we do not know of any property which in reality belongs
        to the
        Church (except the Temple) and we therefore consider the injunction laid
        upon the saints compelling them to purchase property of the Trustee in
        trust for the Church, is a
        deception practiced upon them; and that we look upon the sending of special
        agents abroad to collect funds for the Temple and other purposes as a humbug
        practiced upon the saints by Joseph and others, to aggrandize themselves,
        as we do not believe that the monies and property so collected, have been
        applied as the donors expected, but have been used for speculative purposes,
        by Joseph, to gull the saints the better on their arrival at Nauvoo, by
        buying the lands in the vicinity and selling again to them at tenfold advance;
        and
        further that we verily believe the appropriations said to have been subscribed
        by shares for the building of the Nauvoo House to have been used by J.
        Smith and Lyman Wight, for other purposes, as out of the mass of stock
        already taken, the building is far from being
        finished even to the base.

        That we consider all secret societies, and combinations under penal oaths
        and obligations, (professing to be organized for religious purposes,) to
        be anti-Christian, hypocritical and corrupt.

        That we call upon the honest in heart, in the Church, and throughout the
        world, to vindicate the pure doctrines of Jesus Christ, whether set forth
        in the Bible,
        Book of Mormon, or Book Of Covenants; and we hereby withdraw the hand of
        fellowship, from all those who practice or teach doctrines contrary to
        the above, until they cease so to do, and show works meet for repentance.

        That we hereby notify all those holding licenses to preach the gospel,
        who know they are guilty of teaching the doctrine of other Gods above the
        God of this
        creation; the plurality of wives; the unconditional sealing up against
        all crimes, save that of shedding innocent blood; the spoiling of the gentiles,
        and all other doctrines, (so called)
        which are contrary to the laws of God, or to the laws of our country,
        to cease preaching, and to come and make satisfaction, and have their licenses
        renewed.

        That in all our controversies in defense of truth and righteousness the
        weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through God to the pulling
        down of the strong holds of Satan; that our strifes are not against flesh,
        blood, nor bones; but against
        principalities and power, against spiritual wickedness in high places
        and therefore we will not use carnal weapons save in our own defense.

        You will be called the first Elders of the church, and your mission will
        be to the nations of the earth. You will gather many people unto the fastness

        And many of those that come in under your ministry, because of their much

        And you will know of all that transpires in their midst. And those that
        are your friends will be my friends. This I will promise to you, that when

        as you have inquired of my hand to know and understand wherein I, the Lord,
        justified my servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as also Moses, David and
        Solomon, my servants, as touching
        the principle and doctrine of their having many wives and concubines—
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>behold, and lo, I am the Lord thy God, and will answer thee as touching
        this matter.
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>Therefore, prepare thy heart to receive and obey the instructions which
        I am about to give unto you; for all those who have this law revealed unto
        them must obey the same.

    <block>
        <verse>4</verse><span>For behold, I reveal unto you a new and an everlasting covenant; and if
        ye abide not that covenant, then are ye damned; for no one can reject this
        covenant and be permitted to enter into my glory.
        </span><verse>5</verse><span>For all who will have a blessing at my hands shall abide the law
        which was appointed for that blessing, and the conditions thereof, as
        were instituted from before the foundation of the world.
        </span><verse>6</verse><span>And as pertaining to the new and everlasting
        covenant, it was instituted for the fulness of my glory; and he that receives
        a fulness thereof must and shall abide the law, or he shall be damned,
        saith the Lord God.
        </span><verse>7</verse><span>And verily I say unto you, that the conditions of this law are these:

    <block><span>
        All covenants, contracts, bonds, obligations, oaths, vows, performances,
        connections, associations, or expectations, that are not made and entered
        into and sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, of him who is anointed,
        both as well for time and for all eternity, and that too most holy, by
        revelation and commandment through the medium of mine anointed, whom I
        have appointed on the earth to hold this power (and I have appointed unto
        my servant Joseph to hold this power in the last days, and there is never
        but one on the earth at a time on whom this power and the keys of this
        priesthood are conferred), are of no efficacy, virtue, or force in and
        after the resurrection from the dead; for all contracts that are not made
        unto this end have an end when men are dead.

        that are not by me or by my word, saith the Lord, shall be thrown down,
        and shall not remain after men are
        dead, neither in nor after the resurrection, saith the Lord your God.

        world and she with him, their covenant and marriage are not of force when

        with her for time and for all eternity, if that covenant is not by me or
        by my word, which is my
        law, and is not sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, through him whom
        I have anointed and appointed unto this power, then it is not valid neither
        of force when they are out of the world, because they are not joined by
        me, saith the Lord, neither by my word; when they are out of the world
        it cannot be received there, because the angels and the gods are appointed
        there, by whom they cannot pass; they cannot, therefore, inherit my glory;
        for my house is a house of order, saith the Lord God.

        all heights and depths— then shall it be written in the Lamb’s Book of
        Life, that he shall commit no murder

        no murder whereby to shed innocent blood, it shall be done unto them in
        all things whatsoever my servant hath put upon them, in time, and through
        all eternity; and shall be of full force

        out of the world they should continue; both in the world and out of the
        world should they continue as

        Smith, your wife, whom I have given unto you, that she stay herself and
        partake not of that
        which I commanded you to offer unto her; for I did it, saith the Lord,
        to prove you all, as I did Abraham, and that I might require an offering
        at your hand, by covenant and
        sacrifice.
        </span><verse>52</verse><span>And let mine handmaid, Emma Smith, receive all those that have been given
        unto my servant Joseph, and who are virtuous and pure before me; and those
        who are not pure, and have said they were pure, shall be destroyed, saith
        the Lord God.
        </span><verse>53</verse><span>For I am the
        Lord thy God, and ye shall obey my voice; and I give unto my servant Joseph
        that he shall be made ruler over many things; for he has been faithful
        over a few things, and from
        henceforth I will strengthen him.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>54</verse><span>And I command mine handmaid, Emma Smith, to abide and cleave unto my servant
        Joseph, and to none else. But if she will not abide this commandment she
        shall be
        destroyed, saith the Lord; for I am the Lord thy God, and will destroy
        her if she abide not in my law.
        </span><verse>55</verse><span>But if she will not abide this commandment, then shall my servant Joseph
        do all things for her, even as he hath said; and I will bless him and multiply
        him and give unto him an hundred-fold in this world, of fathers and mothers,
        brothers and sisters, houses and lands, wives and children, and crowns
        of eternal lives in the eternal worlds.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>56</verse><span>And again, verily I say, let mine handmaid forgive my servant Joseph his
        trespasses; and then shall she be forgiven her trespasses, wherein she
        has trespassed against me; and I, the Lord thy God, will bless her, and
        multiply her, and make her heart to rejoice.

    <block>
        <verse>57</verse><span>And again, I say, let not my servant Joseph put his property out of his
        hands, lest an enemy come and destroy him; for Satan seeketh to destroy;
        for I am the Lord thy God, and he is my servant; and behold, and lo, I
        am with him, as I was with Abraham, thy
        father, even unto his exaltation and glory.

        <verse>58</verse><span>Now, as touching the law of the priesthood, there are many things pertaining
        thereunto.
        </span><verse>59</verse><span>Verily, if a man be called of my Father, as was Aaron, by mine own voice,
        and by the voice of him that sent me, and I have endowed him with the keys
        of the power of this
        priesthood, if he do anything in my name, and according to my law and
        by my word, he will not commit sin, and I will justify him.
        </span><verse>60</verse><span>Let no one, therefore, set on my servant
        Joseph; for I will justify him; for he shall do the sacrifice which I
        require at his hands for his transgressions, saith the Lord your God.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>61</verse><span>And again, as pertaining to the law of the priesthood—if any man espouse
        a virgin, and desire to espouse another, and the first give her consent,
        and if he espouse the second, and they are virgins, and have vowed to no
        other man, then is he justified; he cannot commit adultery for they are
        given unto him; for he cannot commit adultery with that that
        belongeth unto him and to no one else.
        </span><verse>62</verse><span>And if he have ten virgins given unto him by this law, he cannot commit
        adultery, for they belong to him, and they are given unto him; therefore
        is he justified.
        </span><verse>63</verse><span>But if one or either of the ten virgins, after she is espoused, shall
        be with another man, she has committed adultery, and shall be destroyed;
        for they are
        given unto him to multiply and replenish the earth, according to my commandment,
        and to fulfil the promise which was given by my Father before the foundation
        of the world, and for their exaltation in the eternal worlds, that they
        may bear the souls of men; for herein is the work of my Father continued,
        that he may be glorified.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>64</verse><span>And again, verily, verily, I say unto you, if any man have a wife, who
        holds the keys of this power, and he teaches unto her the law of my priesthood,
        as pertaining to these things, then shall she believe and administer unto
        him, or she shall be destroyed, saith the Lord your God; for I will destroy
        her; for I will magnify my name upon all those who
        receive and abide in my law.
        </span><verse>65</verse><span>Therefore, it shall be lawful in me, if she receive not this law, for
        him to receive all things whatsoever I, the Lord his God, will give unto
        him,
        because she did not believe and administer unto him according to my word;
        and she then becomes the transgressor; and he is exempt from the law of
        Sarah, who administered unto Abraham according to the law when I commanded
        Abraham to take Hagar to wife.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>66</verse><span>And now, as pertaining to this law, verily, verily, I say unto you, I

                        of June, 1844, about five o’clock p.m., by an armed mob— painted black—of
                        from 150 to 200 persons. Hyrum was shot first and fell calmly,
                        exclaiming, “I am a dead man!” Joseph leaped from the window, and was
                        shot dead in the

                        lived in it. In the short space of twenty years, he has brought forth the
                        Book of Mormon, which he translated by the gift and power of God, and has been the means
                        of publishing it on two continents; has sent the fulness of the everlasting
                        gospel, which it contained, to the four quarters of the earth; has brought
                        forth the revelations and commandments which compose this book of
                        Doctrine And Covenants, and many other wise documents and instructions for the benefit of the

                        a great city, and left a fame and name that cannot be slain. He lived great,

        The same morning, after Hyrum had made ready to go—shall it be said to
        the slaughter?
        yes, for so it was—he read the following paragraph, near the close of
        the twelfth chapter of Ether, in the
        Book of Mormon, and turned down the leaf upon it:

            the Gentiles grace, that they might have charity. And it came to pass that
            the Lord said unto me:
            </span><quote><span>
                If they have not charity it mattereth not unto thee, thou hast been faithful;
                wherefore thy garments shall be made clean. And because thou hast seen
                thy weakness, thou shalt be made strong, even unto the sitting down in
                the place which I have prepared in the mansions of my Father.

            And now I … bid farewell unto the Gentiles; yea, and also unto my brethren

            all men shall know that my garments are not spotted with your blood.

                Brigham Young received two Catholic priests and gave them a tour of the temple, and while they were
                in the upper room, proposed to sell the building to the Catholic church. On January 7, 1846, the
                Catholic church formally declined the offer.</span><break></break><span>https://www.jstor.org/stable/40193435

                Warsaw Times [reprinted in New York Messenger, December 15, 1845]: Two Catholic priests passed through this place on Monday last on their way to Nauvoo. Their object was to ascertain the nature
                and amount of property which the Mormons wish to dispose of to their church, and on what terms it
                can be bought.

                HC: I met with the Council of the Twelve in the southeast corner room of the attic of the temple. We
                knelt around the altar, and dedicated the building to the Most High. We asked his blessing upon our
                intended move to the west; also asked him to enable us some day to finish the Temple, and dedicate it
                to him, and we would leave it in his hands to do as he pleased; and to present the building as a
                monument to Joseph Smith. We asked the Lord to accept the labors of his servants in this land.

                A vote was taken whether the Temple at Nauvoo and Kirtland with public lands should be sold.
                Reasons advanced: the poverty of the Church, the probability of our enemies getting it, or destroying it if not sold. Vote unanimous in favor of selling.

                Almon W. Babbitt, Joseph L. Heywood, and john S. Fullmer were called to act as “trustees” to sell
                church assets. Fuller wrote in an April 1846 letter, “I am chosen together with two of the Brethren as
                ‘Trustees-in-Trust’ to dispose of all Church property and to use it in assisting the poor to go [to] the

                History of Hancock County: About 3 o’clock (in the morning) fire was discovered in the cupola. It had
                made but little headway when first seen, but spread rapidly, and in a very short period the lofty spire
                was a mass of flame, shooting high in the air, and illuminating a wide extent of country. It was seen for
                miles away. The citizens gathered around, but nothing could be done to save the structure. It was
                entirely of wood except the walls, and nothing could have stopped the progress of the flames. In two
                hours, and before the sun dawned upon the earth, the proud structure, reared at so much cost—an
                anomaly in architecture, and a monument of religious zeal—stood with four blackened and smoking
                walls only remaining.

        <verse>1</verse><span>On the third of October, in the year nineteen hundred and eighteen, I
        sat in my room pondering over the scriptures;
        </span><verse>2</verse><span>and reflecting upon the great atoning sacrifice that was made by the Son
        of God, for the redemption of the world;
        </span><verse>3</verse><span>and the great and wonderful love made manifest by the Father and the Son
        in the coming of the Redeemer into the world;
        </span><verse>4</verse><span>that through his atonement, and by obedience to the principles of the
        gospel, mankind might be saved.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>5</verse><span>While I was thus engaged, my mind reverted to the writings of the apostle
        Peter, to the primitive saints scattered abroad throughout Pontus, Galatia,
        Cappadocia, and other parts of Asia, where the gospel had been preached
        after the crucifixion of the Lord.
        </span><verse>6</verse><span>I opened the Bible
        and read the third and fourth chapters of the first epistle of Peter,
        and as I read I was greatly impressed, more than I had ever been before,
        with the following passages:

                    that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened
                    by the Spirit:
                    </span><verse>8</verse><span>“by which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;
                    </span><verse>9</verse><span>“which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited
                    in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is,
                    eight souls were saved by water.” (1 Peter 3:18–20.)

        <verse>11</verse><span>As I pondered over these things which are written, the eyes of my understanding
        were opened, and the Spirit of the Lord rested upon me, and I saw the hosts
        of the dead, both small and great.
        </span><verse>12</verse><span>And there were gathered together in one place an innumerable company of
        the spirits of the just, who had been faithful in the testimony of Jesus
        while they lived in mortality;
        </span><verse>13</verse><span>and who had offered sacrifice in the similitude of the great sacrifice
        of the Son of God, and had suffered tribulation in their Redeemer’s name.
        </span><verse>14</verse><span>All these had
        departed the mortal life, firm in the hope of a glorious resurrection,
        through the grace of God the Father and his Only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>15</verse><span>I beheld that they were filled with joy and gladness, and were rejoicing
        together because the day of their deliverance was at hand.
        </span><verse>16</verse><span>They were assembled awaiting the advent of the Son of God into the spirit
        world, to declare their redemption from the bands of death.
        </span><verse>17</verse><span>Their sleeping dust was to be restored unto its perfect frame, bone to
        his bone, and the sinews and the flesh upon them, the spirit and the body
        to be united never again to be
        divided, that they might receive a fulness of joy.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>18</verse><span>While this vast multitude waited and conversed, rejoicing in the hour
        of their
        deliverance from the chains of death, the Son of God appeared, declaring
        liberty to the
        captives who had been faithful;
        </span><verse>19</verse><span>and there he preached to them the everlasting gospel, the doctrine of
        the resurrection and the redemption of mankind from the fall, and from
        individual sins on conditions of repentance.
        </span><verse>20</verse><span>But unto the wicked he did not go, and among the ungodly and the unrepentant
        who had defiled themselves while in the flesh, his voice was not raised;
        </span><verse>21</verse><span>neither did the rebellious who rejected the testimonies and the
        warnings of the ancient prophets behold his presence, nor look upon his
        face.
        </span><verse>22</verse><span>Where these were, darkness reigned, but among the righteous there was
        peace;
        </span><verse>23</verse><span>and the saints rejoiced in their redemption, and bowed the knee and acknowledged
        the Son of God as their Redeemer and Deliverer from death and the chains
        of hell.
        </span><verse>24</verse><span>Their countenances shone, and the radiance from the presence of the Lord
        rested upon them, and they sang praises unto his holy name.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>25</verse><span>I marveled, for I understood that the Savior spent about three years in
        his ministry among the Jews and those of the house of Israel, endeavoring
        to teach them the everlasting gospel and call them unto repentance;
        </span><verse>26</verse><span>and yet, notwithstanding his mighty works, and miracles, and proclamation
        of the truth, in great power and authority, there were but few who hearkened
        to his voice, and rejoiced in his presence, and received salvation at his
        hands.
        </span><verse>27</verse><span>But his ministry among those who were dead was limited to the brief time
        intervening between the crucifixion and his resurrection;
        </span><verse>28</verse><span>and I wondered at the words of Peter—wherein he said that the Son of God
        preached unto the spirits in prison, who
        sometime were disobedient, when once the long-suffering of God waited
        in the days of Noah—and how it was possible for him to preach to those
        spirits and perform the
        necessary labor among them in so short a time.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>29</verse><span>And as I wondered, my eyes were opened, and my understanding quickened,
        and I perceived that the Lord went not in person among the wicked and the
        disobedient who had rejected the truth, to teach them;
        </span><verse>30</verse><span>but behold, from among the righteous, he organized his forces and appointed
        messengers, clothed with power and authority, and commissioned them to
        go forth and carry the light of the gospel to them that were in
        darkness, even to all the spirits of men; and thus was the gospel preached
        to the dead.
        </span><verse>31</verse><span>And the chosen messengers went forth to declare the acceptable day of
        the Lord and proclaim liberty to the captives who were bound, even unto
        all who would repent of their sins and receive the gospel.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>32</verse><span>Thus was the gospel preached to those who had died in their sins, without
        a knowledge of the truth, or in transgression, having rejected the prophets.
        </span><verse>33</verse><span>These were taught faith in God, repentance from sin, vicarious baptism
        for the remission of sins, the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on
        of hands,
        </span><verse>34</verse><span>and all other principles of the gospel that were
        necessary for them to know in order to qualify themselves that they might
        be judged
        according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.
        </span><verse>35</verse><span>And so it was made known among the dead, both small and great, the unrighteous
        as well as the faithful, that redemption had been wrought through the sacrifice
        of the Son of God upon the cross.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>36</verse><span>Thus was it made known that our Redeemer spent his time during his sojourn
        in the world of spirits, instructing and preparing the faithful spirits
        of the prophets who had testified of him in the flesh;
        </span><verse>37</verse><span>that they might carry the message of redemption unto all the dead, unto
        whom he could not go personally, because of their rebellion and transgression,
        that they through the ministration of his servants might also hear his
        words.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>38</verse><span>Among the great and mighty ones who were assembled in this vast congregation
        of the righteous were Father Adam, the Ancient of Days and father of all,
        </span><verse>39</verse><span>and our glorious Mother Eve, with many of her faithful daughters who had
        lived through the ages and worshiped the true and living God.
        </span><verse>40</verse><span>Abel, the first martyr, was there, and his brother Seth, one of the mighty
        ones, who was in the express image of his father, Adam.
        </span><verse>41</verse><span>Noah, who gave warning of the flood; Shem, the great high priest; Abraham,
        the father of the
        faithful; Isaac, Jacob, and Moses, the great law-giver of Israel;
        </span><verse>42</verse><span>and Isaiah, who declared by prophecy that the Redeemer was anointed to
        bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the
        opening of the prison to them that were bound, were also there.
        </span><verse>43</verse><span>Moreover, Ezekiel, who was shown in vision the great valley of dry bones,
        which were to be clothed upon with flesh, to come forth again in the resurrection
        of the dead,
        living souls;
        </span><verse>44</verse><span>Daniel, who foresaw and foretold the establishment of the kingdom of God
        in the latter days, never again to be destroyed nor given to other people;
        </span><verse>45</verse><span>Elias, who was with Moses on the Mount of Transfiguration;
        </span><verse>46</verse><span>and Malachi, the prophet who testified of the coming of Elijah—of whom
        also Moroni spake to the Prophet Joseph Smith, declaring that he should
        come before the ushering in of the great and dreadful day of the Lord—
        were also there.
        </span><verse>47</verse><span>The Prophet Elijah was to plant in the hearts of the children the promises
        made to their fathers,
        </span><verse>48</verse><span>foreshadowing the great work to be done in the temples of the Lord in
        the dispensation of the fulness of times, for the redemption of the dead,
        and the sealing of the children to their parents, lest the whole earth
        be smitten with a curse and utterly wasted at his coming.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>49</verse><span>All these and many more, even the prophets who dwelt among the Nephites
        and testified of the coming of the Son of God, mingled in the vast assembly
        and waited for their deliverance,
        </span><verse>50</verse><span>for the dead had looked upon the long absence of their spirits from
        their bodies as a bondage.
        </span><verse>51</verse><span>These the Lord taught, and gave them power to come forth, after his resurrection
        from the dead, to enter into his Father’s kingdom, there to be
        crowned with immortality and eternal life,
        </span><verse>52</verse><span>and continue thenceforth their labor as had been promised by the Lord,
        and be partakers of all blessings which were held in reserve for them that
        love him.

    <block>
        <verse>53</verse><span>The Prophet Joseph Smith, and my father, Hyrum Smith, Brigham Young, John
        Taylor,
        Wilford Woodruff, and other choice spirits who were reserved to come forth
        in the fulness of times to take part in laying the foundations of the great
        latter-day work,
        </span><verse>54</verse><span>including the building of the temples and the performance of ordinances
        therein for the redemption of the dead, were also in the spirit world.
        </span><verse>55</verse><span>I observed that they were also among the noble and great ones who were
        chosen in the beginning to be rulers in the Church of God.
        </span><verse>56</verse><span>Even before they were born, they, with many others, received their first
        lessons in the world of spirits and were prepared to come forth in the
        due time of the Lord to labor in his vineyard for the salvation of the
        souls of men.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>57</verse><span>I beheld that the faithful elders of this dispensation, when they depart
        from mortal life, continue their labors in the preaching of the gospel
        of repentance and redemption, through the sacrifice of the Only Begotten
        Son of God, among those who are in darkness and under the bondage of sin
        in the great world of the spirits of the dead.
        </span><verse>58</verse><span>The dead who repent will be redeemed, through obedience to the ordinances
        of the house of God,
        </span><verse>59</verse><span>and after they have paid the penalty of their transgressions, and are
        washed clean, shall receive a reward according to their works, for they
        are heirs of salvation.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>60</verse><span>Thus was the vision of the redemption of the dead revealed to me, and
        I bear record, and I know that this record is true, through the blessing
        of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, even so.</span><break></break><span>Amen.
