        I was born in the town of Sharon in the State of Vermont, North America
        on the twenty- third day of December AD 1805 of goodly parents who spared
        no pains to instructing me in the Christian religion. At the age of about
        ten years my Father Joseph Smith, Sr. moved to Palmyra, Ontario County
        in the State of New York and being in indigent
        circumstances were obliged to labor hard for the support of a large family
        having nine
        children. And as it required their exertions of all that were able to
        render any assistance for the support of the family therefore we were deprived
        of the benefit of an education.
        Suffice it to say I was merely instructed in reading and writing and the
        ground rules of arithmetic which constituted my whole literary acquirements.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        At about the age of twelve years my mind become seriously impressed with
        regard to the all-important concerns of for the well fare of my immortal
        soul which led me to searching the scriptures believing as I was taught,
        that they contained the word of God. Thus
        applying myself to them and my intimate acquaintance with those of different
        denominations led me to marvel exceedingly. For I discovered that they
        did not adorn their profession by a holy walk and Godly conversation agreeable
        to what I found contained in that sacred depository. This was a grief to
        my soul thus from the age of twelve years to fifteen.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        I pondered many things in my heart concerning the situation of the world,
        of mankind, the contentions, and divisions, the wickedness, and abominations,
        and the darkness which pervaded the of the minds of mankind. My mind become
        exceedingly distressed for I become convicted of my sins and by searching
        the scriptures I found that mankind did not come unto the Lord but that
        they had apostatized from the true and living faith and there was no society
        or denomination that built upon the gospel of Jesus Christ as recorded
        in the New Testament. And I felt to mourn for my own sins and for the sins
        of the world for I learned in the scriptures that God was the same yesterday
        to day and forever that he was no respecter to persons for he was God.
        For I looked upon the sun the glorious luminary of the earth and also the
        moon rolling in their majesty through the heavens and also the stars shining
        in their courses and the earth also upon which I stood and the beast of
        the field and the fowls of heaven and the fish of the waters and also man
        walking forth upon the face of the earth in majesty and in the strength
        of beauty whose power and intelligence in governing the things which are
        so exceeding great and marvelous even in the likeness of
        him who created them and when I considered upon these things my heart
        exclaimed well has the wise man said: It is a fool that says in his heart
        there is no God.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        My heart exclaimed all these bear testimony and bespeak an omnipotent
        and omnipresent power, a being who maketh laws and decrees and binds all
        things in their bounds, who fills eternity who was and is and will be from
        all eternity to eternity and when I considered all these things and that
        that being seeks such to worship him as worship him in spirit and in truth
        therefore I cried unto the Lord for mercy for there was none else to whom
        I could go and to obtain mercy.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        And the Lord heard my cry in the wilderness and while in the attitude
        of calling upon the Lord in the 16</span><superscript><span>th</span></superscript><span>
        year of my age a pillar of fire light above the brightness of the sun
        at noon day come down from above and rested upon me and I was filled with
        the Spirit of God and the Lord opened the heavens upon me and I saw the
        Lord. And he spake unto me
        saying:
        </span><quote><span>
            Joseph my son thy sins are forgiven thee. Go thy way walk in my statutes
            and keep my commandments. Behold I am the Lord of glory. I was crucified
            for the world that all those who believe on my name may have eternal life.
            Behold the world lies in sin and at this time and none does good, no not
            one. They have turned aside from the gospel and keep not my commandments.
            They draw near to me with their lips while their hearts are far from me
            and mine anger is kindling against the inhabitants of the earth to visit
            them according to their ungodliness and to bring to pass that which has
            been spoken by the mouth of the prophets and apostles. Behold and lo I
            come quickly, as it is written of me, in the cloud clothed in the glory
            of my Father.
        </span></quote>

    <block><span>
        And my soul was filled with love and for many days I could rejoice with
        great joy and the Lord was with me, but could find none that would believe
        the heavenly vision.
        Nevertheless, I pondered these things in my heart.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        But after many days I fell into transgressions and sinned in many things
        which brought a wound upon my soul. And there were many things which transpired
        that cannot be
        written. And my father’s family have suffered many persecutions and afflictions.
        And it came to pass when I was seventeen years of age I called again upon
        the Lord and he shewed unto me a heavenly vision.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        For behold an angel of the Lord came and stood before me. And it was by
        night and he called me by name and he said the Lord had forgiven me my
        sins. And he revealed unto
        me that in the Town of Manchester, Ontario County, NY there was plates
        of gold upon which there was engravings which was engraven by Moroni &amp;
        his fathers, the servants of the living God in ancient days, and deposited
        by the commandments of God and kept by the power thereof and that I should
        go and get them. And he revealed unto me many things concerning the inhabitants
        of the earth which since have been revealed in commandments &amp; revelations.
        And it was on the 22</span><superscript><span>nd</span></superscript><span>
        day of September AD 1822.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        And thus he appeared unto me three times in one night and once on the
        next day. And then I immediately went to the place and found where the
        plates was deposited as the angel of the Lord had commanded me and straightway
        made three attempts to get them and then being exceedingly frightened I
        supposed it had been a dream of vision but when I considered I knew that
        it was not therefore I cried unto the Lord in the agony of my soul, “Why
        can I not obtain them?”
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Behold the angel appeared unto me again and said unto me, “You have not
        kept the commandments of the Lord which I gave unto you, therefore you
        cannot now obtain them. For the time is not yet fulfilled therefore thou
        wast left unto temptation that thou
        mightest be made acquainted of with the power of the advisory. Therefore
        repent and call on the Lord. Thou shalt be forgiven and in his own due
        time thou shalt obtain them.”
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        For now I had been tempted of the adversary and sought the plates to obtain
        riches and kept not the commandment that I should have an eye single to
        the glory of God.
        Therefore I was chastened and sought diligently to obtain the plates and
        obtained them not until I was twenty-one years of age.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        And in this year I was married to Emma Hale, daughter of Isaac Hale, who
        lived in Harmony, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania on the 18</span><superscript><span>th</span></superscript><span>
        January AD, 1827.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        On the 22</span><superscript><span>nd</span></superscript><span>
        day of September of this same year I obtained the plates—and in the
        December following we moved to Susquehanna by the assistance of a man
        by the name of Martin Harris, who became convinced of the vision and gave
        me fifty dollars to bear my expenses. And because of his faith and this
        righteous deed the Lord appeared unto him in a vision and shewed unto him
        his marvelous work which he was about to do.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        And he immediately came to Susquehanna and said the Lord had shown him
        that he must go to New York City with some of the characters so we proceeded
        to copy some of them. And he took his journey to the Eastern Cities and
        to the learned saying, “Read this I pray thee.” And the learned said, “I
        cannot,” but if he would bring the plates they would read it. But the Lord
        had forbid it. And he returned to me and gave them to me to translate.
        And I said, “I cannot for I am not learned. But the Lord had prepared
        spectacles for to
        read the book.” Therefore, I commenced translating the characters and
        thus the prophecy of Isaiah was fulfilled which is written in the 29</span><superscript><span>th</span></superscript><span>
        chapter concerning the book.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        And it came to pass that after we had translated 116 pages that he desired
        to carry them to read to his friends that peradventure he might convince
        them of the truth. Therefore I inquired of the Lord and the Lord said unto
        me that he must not take them. And I spake unto him (Martin) the word of
        the Lord. And he said inquire again. And I inquired again and also the
        third time. And the Lord said unto me, “Let him go with them, only he shall
        covenant with me that he will not shew them to only but four persons.”
        And he
        covenanted with the Lord that he would do according to the word of the
        Lord.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Therefore he took them and took his journey unto his friends to Palmyra,
        Wayne County &amp; State of New York. And he brake the covenant which he
        made before the Lord. And the Lord suffered the writings to fall into the
        hands of wicked men. And Martin was
        chastened for his transgression. And I also was chastened also for my
        transgression for asking the Lord the third time, wherefore the Plates
        was taken from me by the power of God and I was not able to obtain them
        for a season. And it came to pass after much
        humility and affliction of soul I obtained them again when Lord appeared
        unto a young man by the name of Oliver Cowdery and shewed unto him the
        plates in a vision and also the truth of the work and what the Lord was
        about to do through me, his unworthy
        servant. Therefore he was desirous to come and write for me and to translate.
        Now my wife had written some for me to translate and also my brother Samuel
        H Smith but we
        had become reduced in property. And my wife’s father was about to turn
        me out of doors and I had not where to go. And I cried unto the Lord that
        he would provide for me to
        accomplish the work whereunto he had commanded me.
