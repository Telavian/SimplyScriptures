        <verse>1</verse><span>Faith being the first principle in revealed religion, and the foundation
        of all righteousness, necessarily claims the first place in a course of
        lectures which are designed to unfold to the understanding the doctrine
        of Jesus Christ.

    <block>
        <verse>2</verse><span>In presenting the subject of faith, we shall observe the following order:
        </span><dot>
            <verse>3</verse><span>First, faith itself—what it is.
        </span></dot>
        <dot>
            <verse>4</verse><span>Second, the object on which it rests;
        </span></dot>
        <dot>
            <verse>5</verse><span>Third, the effects which flow from it.
        </span></dot>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>6</verse><span>Agreeable to this order we have first to show what faith is.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>7</verse><span>The author of the epistle to the Hebrews, in the eleventh chapter of that
        epistle, and first verse, gives the following definition of the word faith:
        </span><quote>
            <verse>8</verse><span>Now faith is the substance (assurance) of things hoped for, the evidence
            of things not seen.
        </span></quote>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>9</verse><span>From this we learn that faith is the assurance which men have of the existence
        of things which they have not seen, and the principle of action in all
        intelligent beings.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>10</verse><span>If men were duly to consider themselves, and turn their thoughts and reflections
        to the operations of their own minds, they would readily discover that
        it is faith, and faith only, which is the moving cause of all action in
        them; that without it, both mind and body would be in a state of inactivity,
        and all their exertions would cease, both physical and mental.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>11</verse><span>Were this class to go back and reflect upon the history of their lives,
        from the period of their first recollection, and ask themselves what principle
        excited them to action, or what gave them energy and activity in all their
        lawful avocations, callings, and pursuits, what would be the answer? Would
        it not be that it was the assurance which we had of the
        existence of things which we had not seen as yet? Was it not the hope
        which you had, in consequence of your belief in the existence of unseen
        things, which stimulated you to action and exertion, in order to obtain
        them? Are you not dependent on your faith, or belief, for the acquisition
        of all knowledge, wisdom, and intelligence? Would you exert
        yourselves to obtain wisdom and intelligence, unless you did believe that
        you could obtain them? Would you have ever sown if you had not believed
        that you would reap? Would you have ever planted if you had not believed
        that you would gather? Would you have ever asked unless you had believed
        that you would receive? Would you have ever sought unless you had believed
        that you would have found? Or would you have ever knocked
        unless you had believed that it would have been opened unto you? In a
        word, is there anything that you would have done, either physical or mental,
        if you had not previously believed? Are not all your exertions of every
        kind dependent on your faith? Or may we not ask, what have you, or what
        do you possess, which you have not obtained by reason of your faith? Your
        food, your raiment, your lodgings, are they not all by reason of your
        faith? Reflect, and ask yourselves if these things are not so. Turn your
        thoughts on your own minds, and see if faith is not the moving cause of
        all action in yourselves; and if the moving cause in you, is it not in
        all other intelligent beings?
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>12</verse><span>And as faith is the moving cause of all action in temporal concerns, so
        it is in spiritual; for the Savior has said, and that truly, that “He that
        believeth and is baptized shall be saved” (Mark 16:16).
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>13</verse><span>As we receive by faith all temporal blessings that we do receive, so we
        in like manner
        receive by faith all spiritual blessings that we do receive. But faith
        is not only the principle of action, but of power also, in all intelligent
        beings, whether in heaven or on earth. Thus says the author of the epistle
        to the Hebrews 11:3:
        </span><quote>
            <verse>14</verse><span>Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of
            God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.
        </span></quote>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>15</verse><span>By this we understand that the principle of power, which existed in the
        bosom of God, by which the worlds were framed, was faith; and that it is
        by reason of this principle of power existing in the Deity, that all created
        things exist—so that all things in heaven, on earth, or under the earth,
        exist by reason of faith, as it existed in Him.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>16</verse><span>Had it not been for the principle of faith, the worlds would never have
        been framed, neither would man have been formed of the dust. It is the
        principle by which Jehovah works, and through which he exercises power
        over all temporal, as well as eternal things. Take this principle or attribute
        (for it is an attribute) from the Deity, and he would cease to exist.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>17</verse><span>Who cannot see that if God framed the worlds by faith, that it is by faith
        that he exercises power over them, and that faith is the principle of power?
        And that if the
        principle of power, it must be so in man as well as in the Deity? This
        is the testimony of all the sacred writers, and the lesson which they have
        been endeavoring to teach to man.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>18</verse><span>The Savior says, in explaining the reason why the disciples could not
        cast out the devil, that it was because of their unbelief: “For verily
        I say unto you,” said he, “If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed,
        ye shall say unto this mountain, ‘Remove hence to yonder
        place!’ and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.”
        (Matthew 17:19– 20).

        <verse>20</verse><span>In addition to this we are told in Hebrews 11:32–35, that Gideon, Barak,
        Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets through faith subdued
        kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths
        of lions, quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword,
        out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in
        fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens, and that women received
        their dead raised to life again, etc.

    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>22</verse><span>We here understand that the sacred writers say that all these things were
        done by faith. It was by faith that the worlds were framed—God spake, chaos
        heard, and worlds came into order, by reason of the faith there was in
        Him. So with man also—he spake by faith in the name of God, and the sun
        stood still, the moon obeyed, mountains removed, prisons fell,
        lions’ mouths were closed, the human heart lost its enmity, fire its violence,
        armies their power, the sword its terror, and death its dominion; and all
        this by reason of the faith
        which was in him.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>23</verse><span>Had it not been for the faith which was in man, they might have spoken
        to the sun, the moon, the mountains, prisons, lions, the human heart, fire,
        armies, the sword, or to death in vain!
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>24</verse><span>Faith then, is the first great governing principle which has power, dominion,
        and authority over all things; by it they exist, by it they are upheld,
        by it they are changed, or by it they remain, agreeable to the will of
        God. Without it, there is no power, and
        without power there could be no creation, nor existence!

        QUESTIONS
    </span></blockheading>
    <verse>1</verse><question><span>What is theology?</span></question>
    <block><span>
        It is that revealed science which treats of the being and attributes of
        God, his relations to us, the dispensations of his providence, his will
        with respect to our actions, and his
        purposes with respect to our end.
    </span></block>

    <verse>2</verse><question><span>What is the first principle in this revealed science?</span></question>
    <block><span>Faith. (Lecture 1:1)</span></block>

    <verse>3</verse><question><span>Why is faith the first principle in this revealed science?</span></question>
    <block><span>
        Because it is the foundation of all righteousness.

    <verse>4</verse><question><span>What arrangement should be followed in presenting the subject of faith?</span></question>

        First, it should be shown what faith is. (Lecture 1:3)</span><break></break><span>
        Second, the object upon which it rests. (Lecture 1:4)</span><break></break><span>
        Third, the events which flow from it. (Lecture 1:5)
    </span></block>

    <verse>5</verse><question><span>What is faith?</span></question>
    <block><span>
        It “is the assurance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.”
        (Hebrews 11:1)
        That is, it is the assurance we have of the existence of unseen things;
        and being the
        assurance which we have of the existence of unseen things, must be the
        principle of action in all intelligent beings.

        First, by duly considering the operations of my own mind; and second,
        by the direct declaration of scripture.

                Hebrews 11:7 By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as
                yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the
                which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which
                is by faith.

                went out, not knowing
                whither he went. By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a
                strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs
                with him of the same promise.

        which we daily behold with our natural eyes. We are sensible that after
        a revelation of Jesus Christ, the works of creation throughout their vast
        forms and varieties, clearly exhibit his eternal power and Godhead. Romans
        1:20 “For the invisible things of him from the

        that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead.” But we mean those evidences

        <verse>18</verse><span>Two important items are shown from the former quotations. First, after
        man was
        created, he was not left without intelligence, or understanding, to wander
        in darkness, and spend an existence in ignorance and doubt on the great
        and important point which
        effected his happiness, as to the real fact by whom he was created, or
        unto whom he was amenable for his conduct. God conversed with him face
        to face. In his presence he was permitted to stand, and from his own mouth
        he was permitted to receive instruction—he heard his voice, walked before
        him, and gazed upon his glory, while intelligence burst
        upon his understanding, and enabled him to give names to the vast assemblage
        of his Maker’s works.

        <verse>19</verse><span>Second, we have seen that though man did transgress, his transgression
        did not deprive him of the previous knowledge with which he was endowed,

        from his presence.

        and that he did not cease to manifest himself to him even after his fall,
        we shall next proceed to show that
        though he was cast out from the garden of Eden, his knowledge of the existence

                by the sweat of his brow, as I, the Lord had commanded him...and he called
                upon the name of the Lord, and so did Eve his wife also. And they heard
                the voice of the Lord, from the way
                toward the garden of Eden, speaking unto them, and they saw him not, for
                they were shut out from his presence. But he gave unto them commandments,
                that they should worship the Lord their God; and should offer the firstlings
                of their flocks for an
                offering unto the Lord. And Adam was obedient unto the commandment.

                In process of time Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering
                unto the Lord. And Abel also brought of the firstlings of his flock, and
                of the fat thereof. And the Lord had respect unto Abel, and to his offering.
                But unto Cain and to his offering, he had not respect. Now Satan knew this,
                and it pleased him. And Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell.
                And the Lord said unto Cain, “Why are you angry? Why is your countenance
                fallen? If you do well will you not be accepted? And if you do not well,
                sin lies at the door, and Satan desires to have you, and except you shall
                hearken unto my commandments, I will deliver you up; and it shall be unto
                you according to his desire.”

                they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel, and slew

                gloried in what he had done, saying, “I am free! Surely the flocks of

                And now, you shall be cursed from the earth, which has opened her mouth

                unto him, “Therefore, whoever slays Cain, vengeance shall be taken on

        that it was by a manifestation of God to man, and that God continued, after
        man’s transgression, to manifest himself to him and his posterity; and
        notwithstanding they were separated from his immediate
        presence that they could not see his face, they continued to hear his

    <block>
        <verse>32</verse><span>Not only was there a manifestation made unto Adam of the existence of

        talk with Cain after his
        great transgression in slaying his brother, and that Cain knew that it
        was the Lord that was talking with him; so that when he was driven out
        from the presence of his brethren, he
        carried with him the knowledge of the existence of a God. And through
        this means, doubtless, his posterity became acquainted with the fact that
        such a being existed.

    <block>
        <verse>33</verse><span>From this we can see that the whole human family in the early age of their
        existence, in all their different branches, had this knowledge disseminated
        among them; so that the
        existence of God became an object of faith in the early age of the world.
        And the
        evidences which these men had of the existence of a God, was the testimony
        of their fathers in the first instance.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>34</verse><span>The reason why we have been thus particular on this part of our subject
        is that this class may see by what means it was that God became an object
        of faith among men after the

        after him—to search after a knowledge of his character, perfections, and
        attributes, until they became
        extensively acquainted with him; and not only commune with him, and behold
        his glory, but be partakers of his power, and stand in his presence.

    <block>
        <verse>35</verse><span>Let this class mark particularly that the testimony which these men had
        of the existence of a God, was the testimony of man. For previous to the
        time that any of Adam’s posterity had obtained a manifestation of God to
        themselves, Adam, their common father, had testified unto them of the existence
        of God, and of his eternal power and Godhead.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>36</verse><span>For instance, Abel, before he received the assurance from heaven that
        his offerings were acceptable unto God, had received the important information
        of his father that such a being did exist, who had created, and who did
        uphold all things. Neither can there be a doubt existing on the mind of
        any person, that Adam was the first who did communicate the knowledge of
        the existence of a God to his posterity; and that the whole faith of the
        world, from that time down to the present, is in a certain degree dependent
        on the knowledge first communicated to them by their common progenitor.
        And it has been handed down to the day and generation in which we live, as we shall show
        from the face of the sacred records.

    <block>
        <verse>42</verse><span>So Noah was 84 years old when Enos died, 176 when Cainan died, 234 when

        Methuselah died.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>43</verse><span>We can see from this that Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared, Methuselah,

        <verse>44</verse><span>From the foregoing it is easily to be seen, not only how the knowledge

        from the time it was first communicated, it was retained in the minds of
        righteous men, who taught not only their own posterity, but the world;
        so that there was no need of a new revelation to man after Adam’s creation
        to Noah, to give them the first idea or notion of the existence of a God;
        and not only of a God, but of the true and living God.

    <block>
        <verse>45</verse><span>Having traced the chronology of the world from Adam to Noah, we will now
        trace it from Noah to Abraham. Noah was 502 years old when Shem was born—98
        years afterward the flood came, being the 600</span><superscript><span>th</span></superscript><span>
        year of Noah’s age. And Moses informs us that Noah lived after the flood
        350 years; making him 950 years old when he died (Genesis 9:28–29).
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>46</verse><span>Shem was 100 years old when Arphaxad was born (Genesis 11:10). Arphaxad
        was 35 when Salah was born (11:12). Salah was 30 when Eber was born (11:14).
        Eber was 34
        when Peleg was born, in whose days the earth was divided (11:16). Peleg
        was 30 when Reu was born (11:18). Reu was 32 when Serug was born (11:20).
        Serug was 30 when
        Nahor was born (11:22). Nahor was 29 when Terah was born (11:24). Terah
        was 70 when Haran and Abraham were born (11:26).
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>47</verse><span>There is some difficulty in the account given by Moses, of Abraham’s birth.
        Some have supposed that Abraham was not born until Terah was 130 years
        old. This conclusion is
        drawn from a variety of scriptures, which are not to our purpose at present
        to quote. Neither is it a matter of any consequence to us, whether Abraham
        was born when Terah was 70 years old, or 130. But in order that there may
        no doubt exist upon any mind, in
        relation to the object lying immediately before us in presenting the present
        chronology, we will date the birth of Abraham at the latest period—that
        is, when Terah was 130 years old. It appears from this account, that from
        the flood to the birth of Abraham was 352 years.

        <verse>48</verse><span>Moses informs us that Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad 500 years (Genesis
        11:11).
        This added to 100 years, which was his age when Arphaxad was born, makes
        him 600 years old when he died. Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah 403
        years (11:13). This added to 35 years, which was his age when Salah was
        born, makes him 438 years old when he
        died. Salah lived after he begat Eber 403 years (11:15). This added to
        30 years, which was his age when Eber was born, makes him 433 years old
        when he died. Eber lived after he begat Peleg 430 years (11:17). This added
        to 34 years, which was his age when Peleg was born, makes him 464 years
        old. Peleg lived after he begat Reu 209 years (11:19). This
        added to 30 years, which was his age when Reu was born, makes him 239
        years old when he died. Reu lived after he begat Serug 207 years (11:21).
        This added to 32 years, which was his age when Serug was born, makes him
        239 years old when he died. Serug lived after he begat Nahor 200 years
        (11:23). This added to 30 years, which was his age when
        Nahor was born, makes him 230 years old when he died. Nahor lived after
        he begat Terah 119 years (11:25). This added to 29 years, which was his
        age when Terah was born, makes him 148 years old when he died. Terah was
        130 years old when Abraham was born, and is supposed to have lived 75 years
        after his birth, making him 205 years old when he died.

        <verse>53</verse><span>We have now traced the chronology of the world, agreeable to the account
        given in our present Bible,
        from Adam to Abraham, and have clearly determined beyond the power of
        controversy, that there was no difficulty in preserving the knowledge of
        God in the world from the creation of Adam, and the manifestation made
        to his immediate descendants, as set forth in the former part of this lecture;
        so that the students in this class need not have any dubiety resting on
        their minds on this subject; for they can easily see that it is impossible
        for it to be otherwise, but that the knowledge of the existence of a God
        must have continued from father to son, as a matter of tradition, at least.
        For we cannot suppose that a knowledge of this important fact could have
        existed in the mind of any of the
        before-mentioned individuals, without their having made it known to their
        posterity.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>54</verse><span>We have now shown how it was that the first thought ever existed in the
        mind of any individual, that there was such a being as a God who had created
        and did uphold all things; that it was by reason of the manifestation which
        he first made to our father Adam, when he stood in his presence and conversed
        with him face to face at the time of his
        creation.

        <verse>55</verse><span>Let us here observe that after any portion of the human family is made
        acquainted with the important fact that there is a God who has created

        diligence and faithfulness in seeking after him, until like Enoch, the
        Brother of Jared, and Moses, they shall obtain faith in God, and power
        with him to behold him face to face.

        ancient saints to seek after and obtain a knowledge of the glory of God.
        And we have seen that it was human testimony, and
        human testimony only, that excited this inquiry in the first instance
        in their minds. It was the credence they gave to the testimony of their
        fathers—this testimony having aroused their minds to inquire after the
        knowledge of God. The enquiry frequently terminated, indeed, always terminated
        when rightly pursued, in the most glorious discoveries and eternal certainty.

        How did men first come to the knowledge of the existence of a God, so
        as to exercise faith in him?
    </span></question>
    <block><span>
        In order to answer this question, it will be necessary to go back and
        examine man at his creation; the circumstances in which he was placed,
        and the knowledge which he had of God. (Lecture 2:3–11).
        </span><dot><span>
            First, when man was created he stood in the presence of God (Genesis 1:27–28).
            From this we learn that man, at his creation, stood in the presence of
            his God, and had most perfect knowledge of his existence.
        </span></dot>
        <dot><span>
            Second, God conversed with him after his transgression. (Genesis 3:8–22;
            Lecture 2:13–17) From this we learn that, though man did transgress, he
            was not deprived of the previous knowledge which he had of the existence
            of God. (Lecture 2:19)
        </span></dot>
        <dot><span>
            Third, God conversed with man after he cast him out of the garden. (Lecture
            2:22– 25).
        </span></dot>
        <dot><span>
            Fourth, God also conversed with Cain after he had slain Abel. (Genesis

    <verse>7</verse><question><span>What is the object of the foregoing quotation?</span></question>

        It is that it may be clearly seen how it was that the first thoughts were
        suggested to the minds of men of the existence of God, and how extensively
        this knowledge was spread among the immediate descendants of Adam (Lecture
        2:30–33).
    </span></block>

    <verse>8</verse><question><span>
        What testimony had the immediate descendants of Adam in proof of the existence
        of a God?
    </span></question>
    <block><span>
        The testimony of their father. And after they were made acquainted with
        his existence, by the testimony of their father, they were dependent upon
        the exercise of their own faith for a knowledge of his character, perfections
        and attributes (Lecture 2:23–26).
    </span></block>

    <verse>9</verse><question><span>
        Had any others of the human family, beside Adam, a knowledge of the existence
        of God, in the first instance, by any other means than human testimony?
    </span></question>
    <block><span>
        They had not. For previous to the time that they could have power to obtain
        a manifestation for themselves, the all-important fact had been communicated
        to them by their common father; and so from father to child the knowledge
        was communicated as extensively as the knowledge of his existence was known;
        for it was by this means, in the first instance, that men had a knowledge
        of his existence (Lecture 2:35–36).

        Into two parts: First, by embracing that period of the world from Adam

    <block>
        <verse>1</verse><span>In the second lecture it was shown how it was that the knowledge of the
        existence of God came into the world, and by what means the first thoughts
        were suggested to the minds of men that such a being did actually exist;
        and that it was by reason of the knowledge of his existence that there
        was a foundation laid for the exercise of faith in him, as the only being
        in whom faith could center for life and salvation. For faith could
        not center in a being of whose existence we had no idea, because the idea
        of his existence in the first instance is essential to the exercise of
        faith in him.
        </span><quote><span>
            Romans 10:14 How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed?
            and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how
            shall they hear without a preacher?
        </span></quote>
    </block>

    <block><span>
        (or one sent to tell them?). So then faith comes by hearing the word of
        God.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>2</verse><span>Let us here observe, that three things are necessary, in order that any
        rational and intelligent being may exercise faith in God unto life and
        salvation:
        </span><dot>
            <verse>3</verse><span>First, the idea that he actually exists.
        </span></dot>
        <dot>
            <verse>4</verse><span>Second, a correct idea of his character, perfections and attributes.
        </span></dot>
        <dot>
            <verse>5</verse><span>Third, an actual knowledge that the course of life which he is pursuing,
            is according to his will.
        </span></dot>
    </block>

    <block><span>
        For without an acquaintance with these three important facts, the faith
        of every rational being must be imperfect and unproductive, but with this
        understanding, it can become perfect and fruitful, abounding in righteousness
        unto the praise and glory of God the
        Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>6</verse><span>Having previously been made acquainted with the way the idea of his existence
        came into the world, as well as the fact of his existence, we shall proceed
        to examine his
        character, perfections, and attributes in order that this class may see,
        not only the just grounds which they have for the exercise of faith in
        him for life and salvation, but the reasons that all the world also, as
        far as the idea of his existence extends, may have to exercise faith in
        him, the Father of all living.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>7</verse><span>As we have been indebted to a revelation which God made of himself to
        his creatures in the first instance, for the idea of his existence, so
        in like manner we are indebted to the
        revelations which he has given to us for a correct understanding of his
        character,
        perfections, and attributes; because without the revelations which he
        has given to us, no man by searching could find out God (Job 11:7–9).
        </span><quote><span>
            1 Corinthians 2:9–11 But as it is written, “Eye has not seen, nor ear
            heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God
            has prepared for them that love him.” But God has revealed them unto us
            by his Spirit: for the Spirit searches all things, yea, the deep things
            of God. For what man knows the things of a man, save the spirit of man
            which is in him? even so the things of God no man knows, but by the Spirit
            of God.

        <verse>12</verse><span>From the foregoing testimonies, we learn the following things respecting
        the character of God:
        </span><dot>
            <verse>13</verse><span>First, that he was God before the world was created, and the same God
            that he was after it was created.
        </span></dot>
        <dot>
            <verse>14</verse><span>Second, that he is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, abundant in goodness,
            and that he was so from everlasting, and will be to everlasting.
        </span></dot>
        <dot>
            <verse>15</verse><span>Third, that he changes not, neither is there variableness with him; but
            that he is the same from everlasting to everlasting, being the same yesterday
            today and forever; and that his course is one eternal round, without variation.
        </span></dot>
        <dot>
            <verse>16</verse><span>Fourth, that he is a God of truth and cannot lie.
        </span></dot>
        <dot>
            <verse>17</verse><span>Fifth, that he is no respecter of persons, but in every nation he that
            fears God and works righteousness is accepted of him.
        </span></dot>
        <dot>
            <verse>18</verse><span>Sixth, that he is love.
        </span></dot>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>19</verse><span>An acquaintance with these attributes in the divine character, is essentially
        necessary, in order that the faith of any rational being can center in
        him for life and salvation. For if he did not in the first instance believe
        him to be God, that is, the creator and upholder of all things, he could
        not center his faith in him for life and salvation; for fear there should
        be a greater than he, who would thwart all his plans; and he, like the
        gods of the heathen,
        would be unable to fulfil his promises; but seeing he is God over all,
        from everlasting to everlasting, the creator and upholder of all things,
        no such fear can exist in the minds of those who put their trust in him,
        so that in this respect their faith can be without wavering.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>20</verse><span>But second, unless he was merciful and gracious, slow to anger, long-suffering,
        and full of goodness, such is the weakness of human nature, and so great
        the frailties and
        imperfections of men, that unless they believed that these excellencies
        existed in the divine character, the faith necessary to salvation could
        not exist; for doubt would take the place of faith, and those who know
        their weakness and liability to sin, would be in constant doubt of salvation,
        if it were not for the idea which they have of the excellency of the
        character of God, that he is slow to anger, and long-suffering, and of
        a forgiving disposition, and does forgive iniquity, transgression and sin.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>21</verse><span>An idea of these facts does away doubt, and makes faith exceedingly strong.
        But it is equally as necessary that men should have the idea that he is
        a God who changes not, in order to have faith in him, as it is to have
        the idea that he is gracious and long-suffering. For without the idea of
        unchangeableness in the character of the Deity, doubt would take the place
        of faith. But with the idea that he changes not, faith lays hold upon the
        excellencies in his character with unshaken confidence, believing he is
        the same yesterday, today, and forever, and that his course is one eternal
        round.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>22</verse><span>And again, the idea that he is a God of truth and cannot lie, is equally
        as necessary to the exercise of faith in him, as the idea of his unchangeableness.
        For without the idea that he was a God of truth and could not lie, the
        confidence necessary to be placed in his word in order to the exercise
        of faith in him could not exist. But having the idea that he is not man
        that he can lie, it gives power to the minds of men to exercise faith in
        him.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>23</verse><span>But it is also necessary that men should have an idea that he is no respecter
        of persons. For with the idea of all the other excellencies in his character,
        and this one wanting, men could not exercise faith in him, because if he
        were a respecter of persons, they could not tell what their privileges
        were, nor how far they were authorized to exercise faith in him, or whether
        they were authorized to do it at all, but all must be confusion; but no
        sooner are the minds of men made acquainted with the truth on this point
        (that he is no respecter of persons), than they see that they have authority
        by faith to lay hold on eternal life, the
        richest boon of heaven, because God is no respecter of persons, and that
        every man in every nation has an equal privilege.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>24</verse><span>And lastly, but not less important to the exercise of faith in God, is
        the idea that he is love; for with all the other excellencies in his character,
        without this one to influence them, they could not have such powerful dominion
        over the minds of men; but when the idea is planted in the mind that he
        is love, who cannot see the just ground that men of
        every nation, kindred, and tongue, have to exercise faith in God so as
        to obtain eternal life?
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>25</verse><span>From the above description of the character of the Deity which is given
        by him in the
        revelations to men, there is a sure foundation for the exercise of faith
        in him among every people, nation, and kindred, from age to age, and from
        generation to generation.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>26</verse><span>Let us here observe that the foregoing is the character which is given
        of God in his
        revelations to the Former Day Saints, and it is also the character which
        is given of him in his revelations to the Latter Day Saints, so that the
        saints of former days and those of latter days are both alike in this respect;
        the Latter Day Saints having as good grounds to
        exercise faith in God as the Former Day Saints had, because the same character
        is given of him to both.

        First, that God does actually exist; second, correct ideas of his character,

        is according to his mind and will (Lecture 3:3–5).
    </span></block>

    <verse>7</verse><question><span>
        Would the idea of any one or two of the above-mentioned things, enable
        a person to exercise faith in God?
    </span></question>
    <block><span>
        It would not, for without the idea of them all, faith would be imperfect
        and unproductive (Lecture 3:5).
    </span></block>

    <verse>8</verse><question><span>
        Would an idea of these three things lay a sure foundation for the exercise
        of faith in God, so as to obtain life and salvation?
    </span></question>
    <block><span>
        It would; for by the idea of these three things, faith could become perfect

        (Lecture 3:5).
    </span></block>

    <verse>9</verse><question><span>

    <block><span>
        They could not.

    <verse>11</verse><question><span>How do you prove it?</span></question>
    <block><span>
        By the Scriptures: Job 11:7–9; 1 Corinthians 2:9–11 (Lecture 3:7).
    </span></block>

    <verse>12</verse><question><span>What things do we learn in the revelations of God respecting his character?</span></question>
    <block><span>
        We learn the six following things: First, that he was God before the world
        was created, and the same God that he was after it was created. Second,
        that he is merciful and
        gracious, slow to anger, abundant in goodness, and that he was so from
        everlasting, and
        will be so to everlasting. Third, that he changes not, neither is there
        variableness with him, and that his course is one eternal round. Fourth,
        that he is a God of truth and cannot lie.
        Fifth, that he is no respecter of persons; and sixth, that he is love
        (Lecture 3:12–18).
    </span></block>

    <verse>13</verse><question><span>
        Where do you find the revelations which give us this idea of the character
        of the Deity?
    </span></question>
                     <block><span>
                         In the Bible and
                         Book Of Commandments
                         and they are quoted in the third lecture (Lecture 3:9–11).
                     </span></block>

    <verse>14</verse><question><span>
        What effect would it have on any rational being not to have an idea that
        the Lord was God, the creator and upholder of all things?
    </span></question>
    <block><span>
        It would prevent him from exercising faith in him unto life and salvation.
    </span></block>

    <verse>15</verse><question><span>Why would it prevent him from exercising faith in God?</span></question>
    <block><span>
        Because he would be as the heathen, not knowing but there might be a being
        greater and more powerful than he; and thereby he be prevented from fulfilling
        His promises (Lecture 3:19).
    </span></block>

    <verse>16</verse><question><span>Does this idea prevent this doubt?</span></question>
    <block><span>
        It does; for persons having this idea are enabled thereby to exercise
        faith without this doubt (Lecture 3:19).
    </span></block>

    <verse>17</verse><question><span>
        Is it not also necessary to have the idea that God is merciful and gracious,
        long-suffering and full of goodness?
    </span></question>
    <block><span>
        It is (Lecture 3:20).
    </span></block>

    <verse>18</verse><question><span>Why is it necessary?</span></question>
    <block><span>
        Because of the weakness and imperfections of human nature, and the great
        frailties of man; for such is the weakness of man, and such his frailties,
        that he is liable to sin continually, and if God were not long-suffering
        and full of compassion, gracious and merciful, and of a forgiving disposition,
        man would be cut off from before him; in consequence of which he would
        be in continual doubt and could not exercise faith; for where doubt is,
        there faith has no power; but by man’s believing that God is full of compassion
        and forgiveness, longsuffering and slow to anger, he can exercise faith
        in him and overcome doubt, so as to be exceedingly strong (Lecture 3:20).
    </span></block>

    <verse>19</verse><question><span>
        Is it not equally as necessary that man should have an idea that God changes
        not, neither is there variableness with him, in order to exercise faith
        in him unto life and salvation?
    </span></question>
    <block><span>
        It is; because without this, he would not know how soon the mercy of God
        might change into cruelty, his long-suffering into rashness, his love into
        hatred, and in consequence of which doubt man would be incapable of exercising
        faith in him; but having the idea that he is unchangeable, man can have
        faith in him continually, believing that what he was
        yesterday, he is today, and will be forever (Lecture 3:21).
    </span></block>

    <verse>20</verse><question><span>
        It is not necessary also, for men to have an idea that God is a being
        of truth, before they can have perfect faith in him?
    </span></question>
    <block><span>
        It is; for unless men have this idea they cannot place confidence in his
        word, and not being able to place confidence in his word, they could not
        have faith in him; but believing that he is a God of truth, and that his
        word cannot fail, then faith can rest in him without doubt (Lecture 3:22).
    </span></block>

    <verse>21</verse><question><span>
        Could man exercise faith in God so as to obtain eternal life unless he
        believed that God was no respecter of persons?
    </span></question>
    <block><span>
        He could not; because without this idea he could not certainly know that
        it was his privilege so to do, and in consequence of this doubt his faith
        could not be sufficiently strong to save him (Lecture 3:23).
    </span></block>

    <verse>22</verse><question><span>
        Would it be possible for a man to exercise faith in God, so as to be saved,
        unless he had an idea that God was love?
    </span></question>
    <block><span>
        He could not; because man could not love God unless he had an idea that
        God was love, and if he did not love God, he could not have faith in him
        (Lecture 3:24).
    </span></block>

    <verse>23</verse><question><span>
        What is the description which the sacred writers give of the character
        of the Deity calculated to do?
    </span></question>
    <block><span>
        It is calculated to lay a foundation for the exercise of faith in him,
        as far as the knowledge extends among all people, tongues, languages, kindreds,
        and nations—and that from age to age, and from generation to generation
        (Lecture 3:25).
    </span></block>

    <verse>24</verse><question><span>Is the character which God has given of himself uniform?</span></question>
    <block><span>
        It is; in all his revelations whether to the Former Day Saints, or to
        the Latter Day Saints, so that they all have the authority to exercise
        faith in him, and to expect by the exercise of their faith to enjoy the
        same blessings (Lecture 3:26).

        <verse>1</verse><span>Having shown in the third lecture, that correct ideas of the character
        of God are necessary in order to the exercise of faith in him unto life
        and salvation, and that without correct
        ideas of his character, the minds of men could not have sufficient power
        with God to the exercise of faith necessary to the enjoyment of eternal
        life, and that correct ideas of his
        character lay a foundation as far as his character is concerned for the
        exercise of faith, so as to enjoy the fulness of the blessing of the gospel
        of Jesus Christ, even that of eternal glory; we shall now proceed to show
        the connection there is between correct ideas of the
        attributes of God, and the exercise of faith in him unto eternal life.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>2</verse><span>Let us here observe that the real design which the God of heaven had in
        view in making the human family acquainted with his attributes, was that
        they through the ideas of the existence of his attributes, might be enabled
        to exercise faith in him, and through the
        exercise of faith in him, might obtain eternal life. For without the idea
        of the existence of the attributes which belong to God, the minds of men
        could not have power to exercise
        faith on him so as to lay hold upon eternal life. The God of heaven understanding
        most perfectly the constitution of human nature, and the weakness of man,
        knew what was necessary to be revealed, and what ideas must be planted
        in their minds in order that they might be enabled to exercise faith in
        him unto eternal life.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>3</verse><span>Having said so much, we shall proceed to examine the attributes of God,
        as set forth in his revelations to the human family, and to show how necessary
        correct ideas of his
        attributes are, to enable men to exercise faith in him. For without these
        ideas being
        planted in the minds of men, it would be out of the power of any person
        or persons to
        exercise faith in God so as to obtain eternal life. So that the divine
        communications made to man in the first instance, were designed to establish
        in their minds the ideas necessary to enable them to exercise faith in
        God, and through this means to be partakers of his glory.

        </quote>
    </block>

    <block>
        <verse>11</verse><span>By a little reflection it will be seen that the idea of the existence
        of these attributes in the Deity is necessary to enable any rational being
        to exercise faith in him. For without the
        idea of the existence of these attributes in the Deity, men could not
        exercise faith in him for life and salvation; seeing that without the knowledge
        of all things, God would not be able to save any portion of his creatures;
        for it is by reason of the knowledge which he has of all things, from the
        beginning to the end, that enables him to give that understanding to his
        creatures, by which they are made partakers of eternal life; and if it
        were not for the
        idea existing in the minds of men that God had all knowledge, it would
        be impossible for them to exercise faith in him.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>12</verse><span>And it is not less necessary that men should have the idea of the existence
        of the attribute power in the Deity. For unless God had power over all
        things, and was able by his power to control all things, and thereby deliver
        his creatures who put their trust in him from the power of all beings that
        might seek their destruction, whether in heaven, on earth, or in hell,
        men could not be saved; but with the idea of the existence of this attribute
        planted in the mind, men feel as though they had nothing to fear who put
        their trust in God,
        believing that he has power to save all who come to him, to the very uttermost.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>13</verse><span>It is also necessary in order to the exercise of faith in God, unto life
        and salvation, that men should have the idea of the existence of the attribute
        justice in him. For without the idea of the existence of the attribute
        justice in the Deity, men could not have confidence sufficiently to place
        themselves under his guidance and direction; for they would be filled
        with fear and doubt, lest the Judge of all the earth would not do right;
        and thus fear, or doubt, existing in the mind, would preclude the possibility
        of the exercise of faith in him for life and salvation. But when the idea
        of the existence of the attribute justice in the
        Deity, is fairly planted in the mind, it leaves no room for doubt to get
        into the heart, and the mind is enabled to cast itself upon the Almighty
        without fear and without doubt, and with most unshaken confidence, believing
        that the Judge of all the earth will do right.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>14</verse><span>It is also of equal importance that men should have the idea of the existence
        of the attribute judgment in God, in order that they may exercise faith
        in him for life and
        salvation; for without the idea of the existence of this attribute in
        the Deity, it would be impossible for men to exercise faith in him for
        life and salvation, seeing that it is through the exercise of this attribute
        that the faithful in Christ Jesus are delivered out of the hands of those
        who seek their destruction; for if God were not to come out in swift judgment
        against the workers of iniquity and the powers of darkness, his saints
        could not be saved; for it is by judgment that the Lord delivers his saints
        out of the hands of all their enemies, and those who reject the gospel
        of our Lord Jesus Christ. But no sooner is the idea of the existence of
        this attribute planted in the minds of men, than it gives power to the
        mind for the exercise of faith and confidence in God. And they are enabled
        by faith to lay hold on the promises which are set before them, and wade
        through all the tribulations and
        afflictions to which they are subjected by reason of the persecution from
        those who know not God, and obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ;
        believing that in due time the Lord will come out in swift judgment against
        their enemies, and they shall be cut off from before him, and that in his
        own due time he will bear them off conquerors and more than conquerors
        in all things.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>15</verse><span>And again it is equally important that men should have the idea of the
        existence of the attribute mercy in the Deity, in order to exercise faith
        in him for life and salvation. For without the idea of the existence of
        this attribute in the Deity, the spirits of the saints would faint in the
        midst of the tribulations, afflictions, and persecutions which they have
        to endure for righteousness’ sake; but when the idea of the existence of
        this attribute is once established in the mind, it gives life and energy
        to the spirits of the saints; believing that the mercy of God will be poured
        out upon them in the midst of their afflictions, and that he will compassionate
        them in their sufferings, and that the mercy of God will lay hold of them
        and secure them in the arms of his love, so that they will receive a full
        reward for all their sufferings.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>16</verse><span>And lastly, but not less important to the exercise of faith in God, is
        the idea of the existence of the attribute truth in him. For without the
        idea of the existence of this
        attribute, the mind of man could have nothing upon which it could rest
        with certainty. All would be confusion and doubt, but with the idea of
        the existence of this attribute in the Deity in the mind, all the teachings,
        instructions, promises, and blessings become
        realities, and the mind is enabled to lay hold of them with certainty
        and confidence. Believing that these things, and all that the Lord has
        said, shall be fulfilled in their time;
        and that all the cursings, denunciations, and judgments pronounced upon
        the heads of the unrighteous will also be executed in the due time of the
        Lord; and by reason of the truth and veracity of him, the mind beholds
        its deliverance and salvation as being certain.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>17</verse><span>Let the mind once reflect sincerely and candidly upon the ideas of the
        existence of the before-mentioned attributes in the Deity, and it will
        be seen that as far as his attributes are concerned, there is a sure foundation
        laid for the exercise of faith in him for life and
        salvation. For inasmuch as God possesses the attribute knowledge, he can
        make all things known to his saints necessary for their salvation; and
        as he possesses the attribute power he is able thereby to deliver them
        from the power of all enemies; and seeing also, that justice
        is an attribute of the Deity, he will deal with them upon the principles
        of righteousness and equity, and a just reward will be granted unto them
        for all their afflictions and
        sufferings for the truth’s sake. And as judgment is an attribute of the
        Deity also, his saints can have the most unshaken confidence that they
        will, in due time, obtain a perfect
        deliverance out of the hands of all their enemies, and a complete victory
        over all those
        who have sought their hurt and destruction. And as mercy is also an attribute
        of the Deity, his saints can have confidence that it will be exercised
        toward them; and through the
        exercise of that attribute toward them, comfort and consolation will be
        administered unto them abundantly, amid all their afflictions and tribulations.
        And lastly, realizing that truth is an attribute of the Deity, the mind
        is led to rejoice amid all its trials and temptations, in hope of that
        glory which is to be brought at the revelation of Jesus Christ; and in
        view of that crown which is to be placed upon the heads of the saints in
        the day when the Lord shall distribute rewards unto them, and in prospect
        of that eternal weight of glory, which the Lord has promised to bestow
        upon them, when he shall bring them into the midst of his throne to dwell
        in his presence eternally.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>18</verse><span>In view, then, of the existence of these attributes, the faith of the
        saints can become
        exceedingly strong, abounding in righteousness unto the praise and glory
        of God, and can exert its mighty influence in searching after wisdom and
        understanding, until it has obtained a knowledge of all things that pertain
        to life and salvation.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>19</verse><span>Such then is the foundation which is laid through the revelation of the
        attributes of God for the exercise of faith in him for life and salvation;
        and seeing that these are attributes of the Deity, they are unchangeable—being
        the same yesterday, today and forever—which gives to the minds of the Latter
        Day Saints the same power and authority to exercise faith in God which
        the Former Day Saints had. So that all the saints in this respect have
        been, are, and will be alike until the end of time; for God never changes,
        therefore his attributes and character remain forever the same. And as
        it is through the revelation of these that a foundation is laid for the
        exercise of faith in God unto life and salvation. The foundation, therefore,
        for the exercise of faith was, is, and ever will be the same. So that all
        men have had, and will have, an equal privilege.

        <verse>1</verse><span>In our former lectures we treated of the being, character, perfections,
        and attributes of God. What we mean by perfections is, the perfections
        which belong to all the attributes of his nature. We shall in this lecture
        speak of the Godhead; we mean the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

        <verse>2</verse><span>There are two personages who constitute the great, matchless, governing,
        and supreme power over all things—by whom all things were created and made
        that are created and made, whether visible or invisible; whether in heaven,
        on earth, or in the earth, under the earth, or throughout the immensity
        of space. They are the Father and the Son: The Father being a personage
        of spirit, glory, and power, possessing all perfection and fulness. The
        Son, who was in the bosom of the Father, a personage of tabernacle, made
        or fashioned
        like unto man, or being in the form and likeness of man—or rather, man
        was formed after his likeness and in his image. He is also the express
        image and likeness of the personage of the Father, possessing all the fulness
        of the Father, or the same fulness with the Father, being begotten of him;
        and was ordained from before the foundation of the world to be a propitiation
        for the sins of all those who should believe on his name; and is called
        the Son because of the flesh—and descended in suffering below that which
        man can suffer, or in other words, suffered greater sufferings, and was
        exposed to more powerful contradictions than any man can be. But notwithstanding
        all this, he kept the law of God and remained without sin; showing thereby
        that it is in the power of man to keep the law and remain also without
        sin. And also, that by him a righteous judgment might come upon all flesh,
        and that all who walk not in the law of God, may justly be condemned by
        the law, and have no excuse for their sins. And he being the Only Begotten
        of the Father, full of grace and truth, and having overcome, received a
        fulness of the glory of the Father—possessing the same mind with the Father;
        which Mind is the Holy Spirit, that bears record of the
        Father and the Son; and these three are one, or in other words, these
        three constitute the great, matchless, governing, and supreme power over
        all things; by whom all things were created and made, that were created
        and made: and these three constitute the Godhead and are one: the Father
        and the Son possessing the same mind, the same wisdom, glory, power, and
        fulness; filling all in all—the Son being filled with the fulness of the
        Mind, glory, and power; or in other words the Spirit, glory, and power
        of the Father—possessing all knowledge and glory, and the same kingdom;
        sitting at the right hand of power, in the express image and likeness of
        the Father—a Mediator for man—being filled with the
        fulness of the Mind of the Father, or in other words, the Spirit of the
        Father; which Spirit is shed forth upon all who believe on his name and
        keep his commandments; and all those who keep his commandments shall grow
        up from grace to grace, and become heirs of the heavenly kingdom, and joint
        heirs with Jesus Christ; possessing the same mind, being
        transformed into the same image or likeness, even the express image of
        him who fills all in all; being filled with the fulness of his glory, and
        become one in him, even as the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are one.

        <verse>3</verse><span>From the foregoing account of the Godhead, which is given in his revelations,
        the saints have a sure foundation laid for the exercise of faith unto life
        and salvation, through the atonement and mediation of Jesus Christ, by
        whose blood they have a forgiveness of sins, and also a sure reward laid
        up for them in heaven—even that of partaking of the fulness of the Father
        and the Son, through the Spirit. As the Son partakes of the fulness of
        the Father through the Spirit, so the saints are, by the same Spirit, to
        be partakers of the same fulness, to enjoy the same glory; for as the Father
        and the Son are one, so in like manner the saints
        are to be one in them through the love of the Father, the mediation of
        Jesus Christ, and the gift of the Holy Spirit; they are to be heirs of
        God and joint heirs with Jesus Christ.

                his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them. He holds back the
                face of his throne, and spreads his cloud upon it. He has compassed the
                waters with bounds, until
                the day and night come to an end. The pillars of heaven tremble and are
                astonished at his reproof. He divides the sea with his power, and by his
                understanding he smites through the proud. By his Spirit he has garnished
                the heavens; his hand has formed the crooked serpent. Lo, these are parts

    <chapter>6</chapter>
    <block>
        <verse>1</verse><span>Having treated in the preceding lectures of the ideas of the character,
        perfections, and attributes of God, we next proceed to treat of the knowledge
        which persons must have
        that the course of life which they pursue is according to the will of
        God, in order that they may be enabled to exercise faith in him unto life
        and salvation.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>2</verse><span>This knowledge supplies an important place in revealed religion; for it
        was by reason of it that the ancients were enabled to endure as seeing
        him who is invisible. An actual
        knowledge to any person that the course of life which he pursues is according
        to the will of God, is essentially necessary to enable him to have that
        confidence in God, without
        which no person can obtain eternal life. It was this that enabled the
        ancient saints to endure all their afflictions and persecutions, and to
        take joyfully the spoiling of their goods, knowing (not believing merely)
        that they had a more “enduring substance” (Hebrews 10:34).
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>3</verse><span>Having the assurance that they were pursuing a course which was agreeable
        to the will of God, they were enabled to take, not only the spoiling of
        their goods and the wasting of their substance joyfully, but also to suffer
        death in its most horrid forms; knowing (not merely believing) that when
        this earthly house of their tabernacle was dissolved, they had a building
        of God, a house “not made with hands, eternal in the heavens” (2 Corinthians
        5:1).
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>4</verse><span>Such was, and always will be, the situation of the saints of God, that
        unless they have an actual knowledge that the course that they are pursuing
        is according to the will of God, they will grow weary in their minds and
        faint; for such has been, and always will be, the opposition in the hearts
        of unbelievers and those that know not God, against the pure and unadulterated
        religion of heaven (the only thing which ensures eternal life), that they
        will persecute to the uttermost all that worship God according to his revelations,
        receive the truth in the love of it, and submit themselves to be guided
        and directed by his will, and
        drive them to such extremities that nothing short of an actual knowledge
        of their being the favorites of heaven, and of their having embraced that
        order of things which God has established for the redemption of man, will
        enable them to exercise that confidence in him necessary for them to overcome
        the world, and obtain that crown of glory which is laid up for them that
        fear God.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>5</verse><span>For a man to lay down his all, his character and reputation, his honor
        and applause, his good name among men, his houses, his lands, his brothers
        and sisters, his wife and
        children, and even his own life also, counting all things but filth and
        dross for the
        excellency of the knowledge of Jesus Christ, requires more than mere belief
        or supposition that he is doing the will of God, but actual knowledge;
        realizing that when these
        sufferings are ended he will enter into eternal rest, and be a partaker
        of the glory of God.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>6</verse><span>For unless a person does know that he is walking according to the will
        of God, it would be offering an insult to the dignity of the Creator were
        he to say that he would be a partaker of his glory when he should be done
        with the things of this life. But when he has this knowledge, and most
        assuredly knows that he is doing the will of God, his confidence can be
        equally strong that he will be a partaker of the glory of God.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>7</verse><span>Let us here observe, that a religion that does not require the sacrifice
        of all things, never has power sufficient to produce the faith necessary
        unto life and salvation; for from the first existence of man, the faith
        necessary unto the enjoyment of life and salvation never could be obtained
        without the sacrifice of all earthly things; it was through this sacrifice,
        and this only, that God has ordained that men should enjoy eternal life;
        and it is through the medium of the sacrifice of all earthly things, that
        men do actually know that they are doing the things that are well pleasing
        in the sight of God. When a man has offered in sacrifice all that he has
        for the truth’s sake, not even withholding his life, and believing before
        God that he has been called to make this sacrifice, because he seeks to
        do his will, he does know most assuredly that God does and will accept
        his sacrifice and offering, and that he has not nor will not seek his face
        in vain. Under these circumstances then, he can obtain the faith necessary
        for him to lay hold on eternal life.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>8</verse><span>It is in vain for persons to fancy to themselves that they are heirs with
        those, or can be heirs with them, who have offered their all in sacrifice,
        and by this means obtained faith in God and favor with him so as to obtain
        eternal life, unless they in like manner offer unto him the same sacrifice,
        and through that offering obtain the knowledge that they are
        accepted of him.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>9</verse><span>It was in offering sacrifices that Abel, the first martyr, obtained knowledge
        that he was accepted of God. And from the days of righteous Abel to the
        present time, the knowledge that men have that they are accepted in the
        sight of God, is obtained by offering sacrifice. And in the last days,
        before the Lord comes, he is to gather together his saints who have made
        a covenant with him by sacrifice. Psalm 50:3–5 “Our God shall come, and
        shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be
        very tempestuous round about
        him. He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he
        may judge his people. Gather my saints together unto me; those that have
        made a covenant unto me by sacrifice.”
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>10</verse><span>Those then who make the sacrifice will have the testimony that their course
        is pleasing in the sight of God, and those who have this testimony will
        have faith to lay hold on eternal life, and will be enabled through faith
        to endure unto the end, and receive the
        crown that is laid up for them that love the appearing of our Lord Jesus
        Christ. But those who do not make the sacrifice cannot enjoy this faith,
        because men are dependent upon this sacrifice in order to obtain this faith;
        therefore, they cannot lay hold upon eternal life, because the revelations
        of God do not guarantee unto them the authority so to do; and
        without this guarantee faith could not exist.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>11</verse><span>All the saints of whom we have account in all the revelations of God which
        are extant, obtained the knowledge which they had of their acceptance in
        his sight, through the
        sacrifice which they offered unto him. And through the knowledge thus
        obtained, their
        faith became sufficiently strong to lay hold upon the promise of eternal
        life, and to endure as seeing him who is invisible; and were enabled, through
        faith, to combat the powers of darkness, contend against the wiles of the
        adversary, overcome the world, and obtain the end of their faith, even
        the salvation of their souls.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>12</verse><span>But those who have not made this sacrifice to God, do not know that the
        course which they pursue is well pleasing in his sight; for whatever may
        be their belief or their opinion, it is a matter of doubt and uncertainty
        in their mind; and where doubt and uncertainty is, there faith is not,
        nor can it be. For doubt and faith do not exist in the same person at the
        same time. So that persons whose minds are under doubts and fears cannot
        have unshaken confidence; and where unshaken confidence is not, there faith
        is weak; and where faith is weak, the persons will not be able to contend
        against all the opposition, tribulations, and afflictions which they will
        have to encounter in order to be heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ
        Jesus; and they will grow weary in their minds, and the adversary will
        have power over them and destroy them.

    <chapter>7</chapter>
    <block>
        <verse>1</verse><span>In the preceding lectures, we treated of what faith was, and of the object
        on which it rested. Agreeable to our plan we now proceed to speak of its
        effects.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>2</verse><span>As we have seen in our former lectures that faith was the principle of
        action and of power in all intelligent beings, both in heaven and on earth,
        it will not be expected that we will in a lecture of this description attempt
        to unfold all its effects; neither is it necessary to our purpose so to
        do; for it would embrace all things in heaven and on earth, and encompass
        all the creations of God, with all their endless varieties. For no world
        has yet been framed that was not framed by faith; neither has there been
        an intelligent being on any of God’s creations who did not get there by
        reason of faith, as it existed in himself or in some other
        being; nor has there been a change or a revolution in any of the creations
        of God but it has been effected by faith. Neither will there be a change
        or a revolution unless it is effected in the same way in any of the vast
        creations of the Almighty; for it is by faith that the Deity works.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>3</verse><span>Let us here offer some explanation in relation to faith that our meaning
        may be clearly comprehended. We ask then, what are we to understand by
        a man’s working by faith? We answer, We understand that when a man works
        by faith he works by mental exertion instead of physical force. It is by
        words instead of exerting his physical powers, with which every being works
        when he works by faith. God said, “Let there be light: and there was
        light”. Joshua spake, and the great lights which God had created stood
        still. Elijah commanded, and the heavens were stayed for the space of three
        years and six months, so that it did not rain. He again commanded, and
        the heavens gave forth rain. All this was done by faith, and the Savior
        says, If you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, say to this mountain,
        “Remove,” and it will remove; or say to this sycamore tree, “Be ye plucked
        up and planted in the midst of the sea;” and it shall obey you. Faith then
        works by words, and with these its mightiest works have been, and will
        be, performed.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>4</verse><span>It surely will not be required of us to prove that this is the principle
        upon which all
        eternity has acted and will act; for every reflecting mind must know that
        it is by reason of this power that all the hosts of heaven perform their
        works of wonder, majesty, and glory. Angels move from place to place by
        virtue of this power—it is by reason of it that they are enabled to descend
        from heaven to earth; and were it not for the power of faith, they
        never could be ministering spirits to them who should be heirs of salvation,
        neither could they act as heavenly messengers; for they would be destitute
        of the power necessary to enable them to do the will of God.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>5</verse><span>It is only necessary for us to say that the whole visible creation, as
        it now exists, is the effect of faith. It was faith by which it was framed,
        and it is by the power of faith that it continues in its organized form,
        and by which the planets move round their orbits and sparkle forth their
        glory. So then faith is truly the first principle in the science of
        Theology, and when understood, leads the mind back to the beginning and
        carries it forward to the end; or in other words, from eternity to eternity.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>6</verse><span>As faith then is the principle by which the heavenly hosts perform their
        works, and by
        which they enjoy all their felicity, we might expect to find it set forth
        in a revelation from God as the principle upon which his creatures here
        below must act, in order to obtain the felicities enjoyed by the saints
        in the eternal world; and that when God would undertake to raise up men
        for the enjoyment of himself, he would teach them the necessity of living
        by faith; and the impossibility there was of their enjoying the blessedness
        of eternity without it, seeing that all the blessings of eternity are the
        effects of faith.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>7</verse><span>Therefore it is said, and appropriately too, that without faith it is
        impossible to please God. If it should be asked, Why is it impossible to
        please God without faith? the answer would be because without faith it
        is impossible for men to be saved; and as God desires the salvation of
        man, he must of course desire that they should have faith, and he could
        not be pleased unless they had, or else he could be pleased with their
        destruction.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>8</verse><span>From this we learn that the many exhortations which have been given by
        inspired men to those who had received the word of the Lord, to have faith
        in him, were not mere common-place matters, but were for the best of all
        reasons; and that was because without it there was no salvation, neither
        in this world nor in that which is to come. When men begin to live by faith,
        they begin to draw near to God; and when faith is perfected, they
        are like him; and because he is saved they are saved also; for they will
        be in the same
        situation he is in, because they have come to him; and when he appears
        they shall be like him, for they will see him as he is.
    </span></block>

    <heading><span>
        Salvation
    </span></heading>

    <block>
        <verse>9</verse><span>As all the visible creation is an effect of faith, so is salvation also.
        (We mean salvation in its most extensive latitude of interpretation, whether
        it is temporal or spiritual.) In order to have this subject clearly set
        before the mind, let us ask what situation must a person be in, in order
        to be saved? Or what is the difference between a saved man and one who
        is not saved? We answer from what we have before seen of the heavenly worlds:
        they must be persons who can work by faith, and who are able by faith,
        to be ministering spirits to them who shall be heirs of salvation. And
        they must have faith to enable them to act in the presence of the Lord,
        otherwise they cannot be saved. And what constitutes the real
        difference between a saved person and one not saved, is the difference
        in the degree of their faith. One’s faith has become perfect enough to
        lay hold upon eternal life, and the other’s has not. But to be a little
        more particular let us ask, where shall we find a prototype into whose
        likeness we may be assimilated, in order that we may be made
        partakers of life and salvation? Or in other words, where shall we find
        a saved being? For if we can find a saved being, we may ascertain without
        much difficulty, what all others must be in order to be saved. They must
        be like that individual or they cannot be saved. We think that it will
        not be a matter of dispute, that two beings who are unlike each other cannot
        both be saved; for whatever constitutes the salvation of one, will constitute
        the salvation of every creature which will be saved. And if we find one
        saved being in all existence, we may see what all others must be, or else
        not be saved. We ask then, where is the prototype? Or where is the saved
        being? We conclude as to the answer of this question there will be no dispute
        among those who believe the Bible, that it is Christ.
        All will agree in this that he is the prototype or standard of salvation, or in
        other words that he is a saved being. And if we should continue our interrogation,
        and ask how it is that he is
        saved, the answer would be because he is a just and holy being; and if
        he were anything different from what he is, he would not be saved; for
        his salvation depends on his being precisely what he is and nothing else;
        for if it were possible for him to change in the least
        degree, so sure he would fail of salvation and lose all his dominion,
        power, authority, and glory—which constitutes salvation; for salvation
        consists in the glory, authority, majesty, power, and dominion which Jehovah
        possesses, and in nothing else; and no being can possess it but himself
        or one like him. Thus says John in his first epistle, 3:2–3 “Behold, now
        we are the sons of God, and it doth not appear what we shall be: but we
        know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him: for we shall see
        him as he is. And any man that
        has this hope in him, purifies himself, even as he is pure.” Why purify
        himself as he is pure? Because, if they do not, they cannot be like him.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>10</verse><span>The Lord said unto Moses, Leviticus 19:2 “Speak unto all the congregation
        of the children of Israel, and say unto them, Ye shall be holy: for I the Lord
        your God am holy.” And Peter says, first epistle 1:15–16 “But as he who
        has called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation; because
        it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.” And the
        Savior says, Matthew 5:48 “Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father
        who is in heaven is perfect.” If any should ask, Why all these sayings?
        the answer is to be found from what is before quoted from John’s epistle,
        that when he (the Lord) shall appear, the saints will be like him. And
        if they are not holy, as he is holy, and perfect as he is perfect, they
        cannot be like him; for no being can enjoy his glory without possessing
        his perfections and
        holiness, no more than they could reign in his kingdom without his power.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>11</verse><span>This clearly sets forth the propriety of the Savior’s saying, recorded
        in John’s testimony, 14:12 “Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth
        on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these;
        because I go unto the Father.” This taken in connection with some of the
        sayings in the Savior’s prayer, recorded in the 17</span><superscript><span>th</span></superscript><span>
        chapter, gives great clearness to his expressions. He says, in John 17:20–24
        “Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also who shall believe on
        me through their words; that they all may be one; as thou, Father, art
        in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may
        believe that thou hast sent me. And the glory which thou gavest me I have
        given them; that they may be one, even as we are one: I in them, and thou
        in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know
        that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me. Father,
        I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am;
        that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst
        me before the foundation of the world.”

        <verse>12</verse><span>All these sayings put together, give as clear an account of the state
        of the glorified saints as language could give. The works that Jesus had
        done they were to do, and greater works than those which he had done among
        them should they do, and that because he went to the Father. He does not
        say that they should do these works in time; but they should do greater
        works because he went to the Father. He says in the 24</span><superscript><span>th</span></superscript><span>
        verse: “Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with
        me where I am; that they may behold my glory.” These sayings taken in connection,
        make it very plain that the greater works,
        which those that believed on his name were to do, were to be done in eternity,
        where he is going and where they should behold his glory. He had said in
        another part of his prayer, that he desired of his Father that those who
        believed on him should be one in him, as he and the Father were one in
        each other. “Neither pray I for these [the apostles] alone, but for them
        also who shall believe on me through their words: that they all may be
        one.” That is, they who believe on him through the apostles’ words, as well
        as the apostles themselves, “That they all may be one; as thou, Father,
        art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us.”

        <verse>13</verse><span>What language can be plainer than this? The Savior surely intended to
        be understood by his disciples. And he so spake that they might understand
        him, for he declares to his Father in language not to be easily mistaken,
        that he wanted his disciples, even all of them, to be as himself and the
        Father. For as he and the Father were one, so they might be one with them.
        And what is said in the 22</span><superscript><span>nd</span></superscript><span>
        verse is calculated to more firmly establish this belief, if it needs
        anything to establish it. He says, “And the glory which thou gavest me
        I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one.” As much as to say,
        that unless they have the glory which the Father had given him, they could
        not be one with them. For he
        says he had given them the glory that the Father had given him, that they
        might be one, or in other words, to make them one.

    <block>
        <verse>14</verse><span>This fills up the measure of information on this subject, and shows most
        clearly that the Savior wished his disciples to understand that they were
        to be partakers with him in all things—not even his glory excepted.

        <verse>15</verse><span>It is scarcely necessary here to observe what we have previously noticed,
        that the glory which the Father and the Son have, is because they are just
        and holy beings. And that if they were lacking in one attribute or perfection
        which they have, the glory which they have never could be enjoyed by them;
        for it requires them to be precisely what they are in order to enjoy it;
        and if the Savior gives this glory to any others, he must do it in the
        very way set forth in his prayer to his Father by making them one with
        him, as he and the
        Father are one. In so doing he would give them the glory which the Father
        has given him; and when his disciples are made one with the Father and
        the Son, as the Father and the Son are one, who cannot see the propriety
        of the Savior’s saying, “The works which I do shall they do also; and greater
        works than these shall they do; because I go to the Father”?

        <verse>16</verse><span>These teachings of the Savior most clearly show unto us the nature of
        salvation, and what he proposed unto the human family when he proposed
        to save them; that he
        proposed to make them like unto himself, and he was like the Father—the
        great prototype of all saved beings. And for any portion of the human family
        to be assimilated into their
        likeness is to be saved, and to be unlike them is to be destroyed. And
        on this hinge turns the door of salvation.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>17</verse><span>Who cannot see then, that salvation is the effect of faith? For as we
        have previously observed, all the heavenly beings work by this principle;
        and it is because they are able so to do that they are saved; for nothing
        but this could save them. And this is the lesson
        which the God of heaven, by the mouth of all his holy prophets, has been
        endeavoring to teach to the world. Hence, we are told that without faith
        it is impossible to please God and that salvation “is of faith, that it
        might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed”
        (Romans 4:16). And that Israel, who followed after the law of
        righteousness, has not attained to the law of righteousness. “Wherefore?
        Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the
        law. For they stumbled at that stumbling-stone.” (Romans 9:32). And Jesus
        said unto the man who brought his son to him, to get the devil who tormented
        him, cast out, “If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that
        believeth” (Mark 9:23). These with a multitude of other scriptures which
        might be quoted, plainly set forth the light in which the Savior, as well
        as the Former Day Saints, viewed the plan of salvation—that it was a system
        of faith—it begins
        with faith, and continues by faith; and every blessing which is obtained
        in relation to it, is the effect of faith, whether it pertains to this
        life or that which is to come. To this, all the revelations of God bear
        witness. If there were children of promise, they were the effects of faith;
        not even the Savior of the world excepted. “Blessed is she that believed,”
        said
        Elizabeth to Mary when she went to visit her, “for there shall be a performance
        of those things which were told her from the Lord” (Luke 1:45). Nor was
        the birth of John the Baptist the less a matter of faith; for in order
        that his father Zacharias might believe, he
        was struck dumb. And through the whole history of the scheme of life and
        salvation, it is a matter of faith: every man received according to his
        faith. According as his faith was, so
        were his blessings and privileges; and nothing was withheld from him when
        his faith was sufficient to receive it. He could stop the mouths of lions,
        quench the violence of fire, escape the edge of the sword, wax valiant
        in fight, and put to flight the armies of the
        aliens; women could by their faith receive their dead children to life
        again. In a word, there was nothing impossible with them who had faith.
        All things were in subjection to the Former Day Saints, according as their
        faith was. By their faith they could obtain
        heavenly visions, the ministering of angels, have knowledge of the spirits
        of just men made perfect, of the general assembly and church of the Firstborn
        whose names are written in heaven, of God the Judge of all, of Jesus the
        Mediator of the new covenant, and become
        familiar with the third heavens, see and hear things which were not only
        unutterable, but were unlawful to utter. Peter, in view of the power of
        faith, 2</span><superscript><span>nd</span></superscript><span>
        epistle, 1:1–3 says, to the Former Day Saints: “Grace and peace be multiplied
        unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord, according
        as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life
        and godliness, through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory
        and virtue.” In the first epistle 1:3–5 he says: “Blessed be the God and
        Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his abundant mercy has
        begotten us again unto a
        lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance
        incorruptible and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven
        for you, who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation
        ready to be revealed in the last time.”

        <verse>18</verse><span>These sayings put together, show the apostle’s views most clearly, so
        as to admit of no mistake on the mind of any individual. He says that all
        things that pertain to life and godliness were given unto them through
        the knowledge of God and our Savior Jesus
        Christ. And if the question is asked, How were they to obtain the knowledge
        of God? (For there is a great difference between believing in God and knowing
        him; knowledge implies more than faith. And notice, that all things that
        pertain to life and godliness were given through the knowledge of God);
        the answer is given, Through faith they were to obtain this knowledge;
        and having power by faith to obtain the knowledge of God, they could
        with it obtain all other things which pertain to life and godliness.

    <block>
        <verse>19</verse><span>By these sayings of the apostle, we learn that it was by obtaining a knowledge
        of God that men got the knowledge of all things which pertain to life and
        godliness, and this knowledge was the effect of faith. So that all things
        which pertain to life and godliness are the effects of faith.
    </span></block>

    <block>
        <verse>20</verse><span>From this we may extend as far as any circumstances may require, whether
        on earth or in heaven; and we will find it the testimony of all inspired
        men, or heavenly messengers, that all things that pertain to life and godliness
        are the effects of faith and nothing else. All
        learning, wisdom, and prudence fail; and everything else, as a means of
        salvation—but
        faith. This is the reason that the fishermen of Galilee could teach the
        world—because they sought by faith and by faith obtained. And this is the
        reason that Paul counted all things but filth and dross—what he formerly
        called his gain he called his loss; yea, and he counted “all things but
        loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus the Lord”
        (Philippians 3:710). Because to obtain the faith by which he could enjoy
        the knowledge of Christ Jesus the Lord, he had to suffer the loss of all
        things. This is the reason that the
        Former Day Saints knew more, and understood more of heaven and of heavenly
        things, than all others besides, because this information is the effect
        of faith—to be obtained by no other means. And this is the reason that
        men, as soon as they lose their faith, run into
        strifes, contentions, darkness and difficulties; for the knowledge which
        tends to life
        disappears with faith, but returns when faith returns; for when faith
        comes, it brings its
        train of attendants with it—apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors,
        teachers, gifts, wisdom, knowledge, miracles, healings, tongues, interpretation
        of tongues, etc. All these appear
        when faith appears on the earth, and disappear when it disappears from
        the earth. For these are the effects of faith and always have, and always
        will attend it. For where faith is, there will the knowledge of God be
        also, with all things which pertain thereto—
        revelations, visions, and dreams, as well as every other necessary thing
        in order that the possessors of faith may be perfected and obtain salvation;
        for God must change, otherwise faith will prevail with him. And he who
        possesses it will through it obtain all necessary knowledge and wisdom,
        until he shall know God and the Lord Jesus Christ whom he has sent—whom
        to know is eternal life.</span><break></break><span>Amen.
