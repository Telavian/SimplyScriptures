        Being wrought up in my mind, respecting the subject of religion and looking
        upon at the different systems taught the children of men, I knew not who
        was right or who was
        wrong. And considering it of the first importance that I should be right,
        in matters that involved eternal consequences; being thus perplexed in
        mind I retired to the silent grove and bowed down before the Lord, under
        a realizing sense that he had said (if the Bible
        be true), ask and you shall receive; knock and it shall be opened; seek
        and you shall find. And again, if any man lack wisdom, let him ask of God
        who gives to all men liberally and
        upbraids not.

        Information was what I most desired at this time, and with a fixed determination
        to obtain it, I called upon the Lord for the first time, in the place above
        stated. Or in other words I made a fruitless attempt to pray, my tongue
        seemed to be swollen in my mouth, so that I could not utter.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        I heard a noise behind me, like some person walking towards me. I strove
        again to pray, but could not. The noise of walking seemed to draw nearer.
        I sprung up on my feet, and looked around, but saw no person or thing that
        was calculated to produce the noise of
        walking. I kneeled again. My mouth was opened and my tongue liberated,
        and I called on the Lord in mighty prayer.

        A pillar of fire appeared above my head, it presently rested down upon
        my head, and filled me with joy unspeakable. A personage appeared in the
        midst of this pillar of flame which was spread all around, and yet nothing
        consumed. Another personage soon appeared like
        unto the first. He said unto me, “Thy sins are forgiven thee.” He testified
        unto me that Jesus Christ is the son of God. And I saw many angels in this
        vision.

        I was about 14 years old when I received this first communication. When
        I was about 17 years old I saw another vision of angels, in the night season
        after I had retired to bed. I had not been asleep, when but was meditating
        upon my past life and experience, I was very conscious that I had not kept
        the commandments, and I repented heartily for all my sins and transgression,
        and humbled myself before Him; whose eyes are over all things.

        All at once the room was illuminated above the brightness of the sun.
        An angel appeared before me, his hands and feet were naked pure and white,
        and he stood between the floors of the room, clothed with in purity inexpressible.
        He said unto me, “I am a messenger sent from God. Be faithful and keep
        his commandments in all things.” He told me of a sacred
        record which was written on plates of gold. I saw in the vision the place
        where they were deposited. He said the Indians were the literal descendants
        of Abraham.

        He explained many things of the prophesies to me. One I will mention which
        is this, in Malachi 4: Behold the day of the Lord comes, etc. Also that
        the Urim and Thumim was hid up with the record, and that God would give
        me power to translate it, with the assistance of this instrument. He then
        gradually vanished out of my sight, or the vision
        closed. While meditating on what I had seen, the angel appeared to me
        again and related the same things and much more. Also the third time bearing
        the same tidings, and
        departed. During the time I was in this vision I did not realize anything
        else around me
        except what was shown me in this communication. After the vision had all
        passed, I found that it was nearly daylight. The family soon arose, I got
        up also.

        On that day while in the field at work with my Father he asked me if I
        was sick. I replied I had but little strength. He told me to go to the
        house. I started and went part way and
        was finally deprived of my strength and fell. But how long I remained
        I do not know. The angel came to me again and commanded me to go and tell
        my father what I had seen and heard. I did so. He wept and told me that
        it was a vision from God to attend to it.

        I went and found the place, where the plates were, according to the direction
        of the angel, also saw them, and the angel as before. The powers of darkness
        strove hard against me. I
        called on God. The angel told me that the reason why I could not obtain
        the plates at this time was because I was under transgression, but to come
        again in one year from that time. I did so, but did not obtain them. Also
        the third and the fourth year, at which time I obtained them, and translated
        them into the English language; by the gift and power of God and have been
        preaching it ever since.
