        At the request of Mr. John Wentworth, Editor, and Proprietor of the
        </span><italic><span>
            Chicago Democrat
        </span></italic><span>, I have written the following sketch of the rise, progress, persecution,
        and faith of the
        Latter-Day Saints, of which I have the honor, under God, of being the
        founder. Mr.
        Wentworth says that he wishes to furnish Mr. George Barstow, a friend
        of his, who is
        writing the history of New Hampshire, with this document. As Mr. Barstow
        has taken the proper steps to obtain correct information all that I shall
        ask at his hands, is, that he
        publish the account entire, ungarnished, and without misrepresentation.

    <block><span>
        I was born in the town of Sharon, Windsor Co., Vermont, on the 23</span><superscript><span>rd</span></superscript><span>
        of December, A.D. 1805. When ten years old my parents removed to Palmyra,
        New York, where we resided about four years, and from thence we removed
        to the town of Manchester. My father was a farmer and taught me the art
        of husbandry.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        When about fourteen years of age I began to reflect upon the importance
        of being
        prepared for a future state, and upon enquiring the plan of salvation
        I found that there was a great clash in religious sentiment; if I went
        to one society they referred me to one plan, and another to another; each
        one pointing to his own particular creed as the
        </span><italic><span>summum bonum</span></italic><span>
        of perfection: considering that all could not be right, and that God could not be the
        author of so much confusion I determined to investigate the subject more fully, believing that if God had a church it would not be split up into factions, and that if he taught one
        society to worship one way, and administer in one set of ordinances, he would not teach
        another principles which were diametrically opposed. Believing the word of God I had
        confidence in the declaration of James; “If any man lack wisdom let him ask of God who
        gives to all men liberally and upbraids not and it shall be given him,”
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        I retired to a secret place in a grove and began to call upon the Lord.
        While fervently engaged in supplication my mind was taken away from the
        objects with which I was surrounded, and I was enwrapped in a heavenly
        vision and saw two glorious personages who exactly resembled each other
        in features, and likeness, surrounded with a brilliant
        light which eclipsed the sun at noon-day. They told me that all religious
        denominations were believing in incorrect doctrines, and that none of them
        was acknowledged of God as his church and kingdom. And I was expressly
        commanded to “go not after them,” at the same time receiving a promise
        that the fulness of the gospel should at some future time be made known
        unto me.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        On the evening of the 21</span><superscript><span>st</span></superscript><span>
        of September, A.D. 1823, while I was praying unto God, and endeavoring
        to exercise faith in the precious promises of scripture on a sudden a light
        like that of day, only of a far purer and more glorious appearance, and
        brightness burst into the room, indeed the first sight was as though the
        house was filled with consuming fire; the appearance produced a shock that
        affected the whole body; in a moment a personage stood before me surrounded
        with a glory yet greater than that with which I was already
        surrounded.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        This messenger proclaimed himself to be an angel of God sent to bring
        the joyful tidings, that the covenant which God made with ancient Israel
        was at hand to be fulfilled, that the preparatory work for the second coming
        of the Messiah was speedily to commence; that the time was at hand for
        the gospel in all its fulness to be preached in power unto all nations,
        that a people might be prepared for the millennial reign.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        I was informed that I was chosen to be an instrument in the hands of God
        to bring about some of his purposes in this glorious dispensation.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        I was also informed concerning the aboriginal inhabitants of this country,
        and shown who they were, and from whence they came; a brief sketch of their
        origin, progress,
        civilization, laws, governments, of their righteousness and iniquity,
        and the blessings of God being finally withdrawn from them as a people
        was made known unto me. I was also told where there was deposited some
        plates on which were engraven an abridgement of the records of the ancient
        prophets that had existed on this continent. The angel appeared to me three
        times the same night and unfolded the same things.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        After having received many visits from the angels of God unfolding the
        majesty, and glory of the events that should transpire in the last days,
        on the morning of the 22</span><superscript><span>nd</span></superscript><span>
        of September A.D. 1827, the angel of the Lord delivered the records into
        my hands.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        These records were engraven on plates which had the appearance of gold,
        each plate was six inches wide and eight inches long and not quite so thick
        as common tin. They were
        filled with engravings, in Egyptian characters and bound together in a
        volume, as the
        leaves of a book with three rings running through the whole. The volume
        was something near six inches in thickness, a part of which was sealed.
        The characters on the unsealed part were small, and beautifully engraved.
        The whole book exhibited many marks of antiquity in its construction and
        much skill in the art of engraving. With the records was found a curious
        instrument which the ancients called “Urim and Thummim,” which consisted
        of two transparent stones set in the rim of a bow fastened to a breast
        plate.
        Through the medium of the Urim and Thummim I translated the record by
        the gift, and power of God.

        In this important and interesting book the history of ancient America
        is unfolded, from its first settlement by a colony that came from the tower
        of Babel, at the confusion of
        languages to the beginning of the fifth century of the Christian era.
        We are informed by these records that America in ancient times has been
        inhabited by two distinct races of people. The first were called Jaredites
        and came directly from the tower of Babel. The second race came directly
        from the city of Jerusalem, about six hundred years before Christ. They
        were principally Israelites, of the descendants of Joseph. The Jaredites
        were
        destroyed about the time that the Israelites came from Jerusalem, who
        succeeded them in the inheritance of the country. The principal nation
        of the second race fell in battle
        towards the close of the fourth century. The remnant are the Indians that
        now inhabit this country.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        This book also tells us that our Savior made his appearance upon this
        continent after his
        resurrection, that he planted the gospel here in all its fulness, and
        richness, and power, and blessing; that they had apostles, prophets, pastors,
        teachers and evangelists; the same order, the same priesthood, the same
        ordinances, gifts, powers, and blessing, as was enjoyed on the eastern
        continent, that the people were cut off in consequence of their transgressions,
        that the last of their prophets who existed among them was commanded to
        write an
        abridgement of their prophesies, history, etc., and to hide it up in the
        earth, and that it should come forth and be united with the Bible
        for the accomplishment of the purposes of God in the last days. For a
        more particular account I would refer to the
        Book of Mormon,
        which can be purchased at Nauvoo, or from any of our travelling elders.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        As soon as the news of this discovery was made known, false reports, misrepresentation
        and slander flew as on the wings of the wind in every direction, the house
        was frequently beset by mobs, and evil designing persons, several times
        I was shot at, and very narrowly escaped, and every device was made use
        of to get the plates away from me, but the power and blessing of God attended
        me, and several began to believe my testimony.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        On the 6</span><superscript><span>th</span></superscript><span>
        of April, 1830, the “Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints,” was
        first organized in the town of Manchester, Ontario co., state of New York.8
        Some few were called and ordained by the spirit of revelation, and prophesy,
        and began to preach as the
        spirit gave them utterance, and though weak, yet were they strengthened
        by the power of God, and many were brought to repentance, were immersed
        in the water, and were filled with the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands.
        They saw visions and prophesied, devils were cast out and the sick healed
        by the laying on of hands. From that time the work
        rolled forth with astonishing rapidity, and churches were soon formed
        in the states of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and Missouri;
        in the last named state a considerable settlement was formed in Jackson
        co.; numbers joined the church and we
        were increasing rapidly; we made large purchases of land, our farms teemed
        with plenty, and peace and happiness was enjoyed in our domestic circle
        and throughout our neighborhood; but as we could not associate with our
        neighbors who were many of them
        of the basest of men and had fled from the face of civilized society,
        to the frontier country to escape the hand of justice, in their midnight
        revels, their sabbath breaking, horseracing, and gambling, they commenced
        at first ridicule, then to persecute, and finally an
        organized mob assembled and burned our houses, tarred, and feathered,
        and whipped many of our brethren and finally drove them from their habitations;
        who houseless, and homeless, contrary to law, justice and humanity, had
        to wander on the bleak prairies till the children left the tracks of their
        blood on the prairie, this took place in the month of November, and they
        had no other covering but the canopy of heaven, in this inclement season
        of the year; this proceeding was winked at by the government and although
        we had warrantee deeds for our land, and had violated no law we could obtain
        no redress.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        There were many sick, who were thus inhumanly driven from their houses,
        and had to endure all this abuse and to seek homes where they could be
        found. The result was, that a great many of them being deprived of the
        comforts of life, and the necessary attendances, died; many children were
        left orphans; wives, widows; and husbands widowers. Our farms were taken
        possession of by the mob, many thousands of cattle, sheep, horses, and
        hogs,
        were taken and our household goods, store goods, and printing press, and
        type were broken, taken, or otherwise destroyed.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Many of our brethren removed to Clay where they continued until 1836,
        three years; there was no violence offered but there were threatenings
        of violence. But in the summer of 1836, these threatenings began to assume
        a more serious form; from threats, public
        meetings were called, resolutions were passed, vengeance and destruction
        were threatened, and affairs again assumed a fearful attitude, Jackson
        County was a sufficient precedent, and as the authorities in that county
        did not interfere, they boasted that they would not in this, which on application
        to the authorities we found to be too true, and after much
        violence, privation and loss of property we were again driven from our
        homes.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        We next settled in Caldwell, and Daviess Counties, where we made large
        and extensive settlements, thinking to free ourselves from the power of
        oppression, by settling in new counties, with very few inhabitants in them;
        but here we were not allowed to live in peace, but in 1838 we were again
        attacked by mobs an exterminating order was issued by Gov. Lilburn W. Boggs,
        and under the sanction of law an organized banditti ranged
        through the country, robbed us of our cattle, sheep, horses, hogs, etc.,
        many of our people were murdered in cold blood, the chastity of our women
        was violated, and we were
        forced to sign away our property at the point of the sword, and after
        enduring every
        indignity that could be heaped upon us by an inhuman, ungodly band of
        marauders, from twelve to fifteen thousand souls men, women, and children
        were driven from their own
        fire sides, and from lands that they had warrantee deeds of, houseless,
        friendless, and
        homeless (in the depth of winter,) to wander as exiles on the earth or
        to seek an asylum in a more genial clime, and among a less barbarous people.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Many sickened and died, in consequence of the cold, and hardships they
        had to endure; many wives were left widows, and children orphans, and destitute.
        It would take more time than is allotted me here to describe the injustice,
        the wrongs, the murders, the bloodshed, the theft, misery and woe that
        has been caused by the barbarous, inhuman, and lawless, proceedings of
        the state of Missouri.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        In the situation before alluded to we arrived in the state of Illinois
        in 1839, where we
        found a hospitable people and a friendly home; a people who were willing
        to be governed by the principles of law and humanity. We have commenced
        to build a city called
        “Nauvoo” in Hancock co., we number from six to eight thousand here besides
        vast numbers in the county around and in almost every county of the state.
        We have a city
        charter granted us and a charter for a legion the troops of which now
        number 1500. We have also a charter for a university, for an agricultural
        and manufacturing society, have our own laws and administrators, and possess
        all the privileges that other free and
        enlightened citizens enjoy.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Persecution has not stopped the progress of truth, but has only added
        fuel to the flame, it has spread with increasing rapidity, proud of the
        cause which they have espoused and conscious of their innocence and of
        the truth of their system amidst calumny and reproach have the elders of
        this church gone forth, and planted the gospel in almost every state in
        the Union; it has penetrated our cities, it has spread over our villages,
        and has caused thousands of our intelligent, noble, and patriotic citizens
        to obey its divine mandates, and be governed by its sacred truths. It has
        also spread into England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales: in the year of 1839
        where a few of our missionaries were sent over five thousand joined the
        standard of truth, there are numbers now joining in every land.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Our missionaries are going forth to different nations, and in Germany,
        Palestine, New Holland, the East Indies, and other places, the standard
        of truth has been erected: no
        unhallowed hand can stop the work from progressing, persecutions may rage,
        mobs may combine, armies may assemble, calumny may defame, but the truth
        of God will go forth boldly, nobly, and independent till it has penetrated
        every continent, visited every clime, swept every country, and sounded
        in every ear, till the purposes of God shall be
        accomplished and the great Jehovah shall say the work is done.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        We believe in God the Eternal Father, and in his son Jesus Christ, and
        in the Holy Ghost.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        We believe that men will be punished for their own sins and not for Adam’s transgression.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        We believe that through the atonement of Christ all mankind may be saved
        by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        We believe that these ordinances are 1</span><superscript><span>st</span></superscript><span>,
        Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; 2</span><superscript><span>nd</span></superscript><span>,
        Repentance; 3</span><superscript><span>rd</span></superscript><span>,
        Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; 4</span><superscript><span>th</span></superscript><span>,
        Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        We believe that a man must be called of God by “prophesy, and by laying
        on of hands” by those who are in authority to preach the gospel and administer
        in the ordinances thereof.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        We believe in the same organization that existed in the primitive church,
        viz: apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists, etc.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        We believe in the gift of tongues, prophesy, revelation, visions, healing,
        interpretation of tongues, etc.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly; we also believe
        the Book of Mormon to be the word of God.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        We believe all that God has revealed, all that he does now reveal, and
        we believe that he will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining
        to the kingdom of God.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        We believe in the literal gathering of Israel and in the restoration of
        the Ten Tribes. That Zion will be built upon this continent. That Christ
        will reign personally upon the earth, and that the earth will be renewed
        and receive its paradisaic glory.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        We claim the privilege of worshipping Almighty God according to the dictates
        of our conscience, and allow all men the same privilege let them worship
        how, where, or what they may.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates,
        in obeying, honoring and sustaining the law.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in
        doing good to all men; indeed we may say that we follow the admonition
        of Paul “we believe all things we hope all things,” we have endured many
        things and hope to be able to endure all things. If there is anything virtuous,
        lovely, or of good report or praise worthy we seek after these things.
    </span></block>

    <block><span>
        Respectfully, etc.
