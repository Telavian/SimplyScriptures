        Then understood his disciples that he should come again on the earth,
        after that he was glorified and crowned on the right hand of God.

            Master, show us concerning the buildings of the temple, as thou hast said:

            Tell us when shall these things be which thou hast said concerning the

                Take heed that no man deceive you;
                </span><verse>6</verse><span>for many shall come in my name, saying—“I am Christ”—and shall deceive many;
                </span><verse>7</verse><span>then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you, and
                ye shall be hated of all nations, for my name’s sake;

                hate one another;

                </span><verse>11</verse><span>but he that remaineth steadfast and is not overcome, the same shall be
                saved.

                <verse>12</verse><span>When you, therefore, shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of
                by Daniel the prophet, concerning the destruction of Jerusalem, then you
                shall stand in the holy place; whoso readeth let him understand.
                </span><verse>13</verse><span>Then let them who are in Judea flee into the mountains;
                </span><verse>14</verse><span>let him who is on the housetop flee, and not return to take anything out
                of his house;
                </span><verse>15</verse><span>Neither let him who is in the field return back to take his clothes;
                </span><verse>16</verse><span>and wo unto them that are with child, and unto them that give suck in
                those days;
                </span><verse>17</verse><span>therefore, pray ye the Lord that your flight be not in the winter, neither
                on the
                Sabbath day;

                <verse>18</verse><span>For then, in those days, shall be great tribulation on the Jews, and upon
                the inhabitants of Jerusalem, such as was not before sent upon Israel,
                of God, since the beginning of their kingdom until this time; no, nor ever
                shall be sent again upon Israel.
                </span><verse>19</verse><span>All things which have befallen them are only the beginning of the sorrows
                which shall come upon them.
                </span><verse>20</verse><span>And except those days should be shortened, there
                should none of their flesh be saved; but for the elect’s sake, according
                to the covenant,
                those days shall be shortened.
                </span><verse>21</verse><span>Behold, these things I have spoken unto you concerning the Jews.

                And again, after the tribulation of those days which shall come upon Jerusalem,
                if any man shall say unto you, “Lo, here is Christ,” or “There;” believe
                him not;
                </span><verse>22</verse><span>for in those days there shall also arise false Christs, and false prophets,
                and shall show great signs and wonders, insomuch, that, if possible, they
                shall deceive the very elect, who are the elect according to the covenant.

                all I have told you must come to pass; but the end is not yet.

                go not forth. “Behold, he is in the secret chambers;” believe it not.
                </span><verse>26</verse><span>For as the light of the morning cometh out of the east, and shineth even
                unto the west, and covereth the whole earth, so shall also the coming of

                be gathered from the four quarters of the earth.

                shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.
                </span><verse>30</verse><span>And again, because iniquity shall abound, the love of men shall wax cold;
                but he that shall not be
                overcome, the same shall be saved.
                </span><verse>31</verse><span>And again, this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world,
                for a witness unto all nations, and then shall the end come, or the destruction
                of the wicked;
                </span><verse>32</verse><span>and again shall the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the
