 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>The Proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel:
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>to know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>to receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and
  equity;
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>to give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and
  discretion.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of
  understanding shall attain unto wise counsels;
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>to understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise,
  and their dark sayings.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; but fools despise
  wisdom and instruction.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of
  thy mother;
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>for
  they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy
  neck.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>The enticements of sinners
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>If they say, “Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk
  privily for the innocent without cause;
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go
  down into the pit;
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>we shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with
  spoil;
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse;”
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>my son walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their
  path;
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>for their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for their own
  lives.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>So are the ways of everyone that is greedy of gain; which taketh away
  the life of the owners thereof.

  Wisdom
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets;
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>she crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the
  gates; in the city she uttereth her words, saying,
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>“How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? And the scorners
  delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>Turn you at my reproof; behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I
  will make known my words unto you.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand,
  and no man regarded;
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>but ye have set at naught all my counsel, and would none of my reproof;
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>I also will laugh at your calamity; will mock when your fear cometh;
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>when your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a
  whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me
  early, but they shall not find me;
  </span><verse>29</verse><span>for that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD;
  </span><verse>30</verse><span>they would none of my counsel; they despised all my reproof.
  </span><verse>31</verse><span>Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled
  with their own devices.
  </span><verse>32</verse><span>For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity
  of fools shall destroy them.
  </span><verse>33</verse><span>But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet
  from fear of evil.”

  Apply thy heart to understanding
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>2
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with
  thee;
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>so that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to
  understanding;
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for
  understanding;
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>if thou seekest her as silver, and searcheth for her as for hid
  treasures;
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge
  of God.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>For the LORD giveth wisdom; out of his mouth
  cometh knowledge and understanding.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous;
  he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>He
  keeps the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and
  judgment, and equity; yea, every good path.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto
  thy soul;
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee;
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>to deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man that
  speaketh froward things;
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the wicked;
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>whose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths;
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>to deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger which
  flattereth with her words;
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of
  her God.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths
  of life.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the
  righteous.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain
  in it.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors
  shall be rooted out of it.

  Lean not unto thine own understanding

 <chapter>3
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments;
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>for length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to
  thee.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>Let not mercy and truth forsake thee; bind them about thy neck; write
  them upon the table of thine heart;
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>so shalt thou find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and
  man.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own
  understanding.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>In
  all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>Be not wise in thine own eyes; fear the LORD,
  and depart from evil.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>It shall be health to thy
  navel, and marrow to thy bones.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>Honor the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all
  thine increase;
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>so
  shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out
  with new wine.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his
  correction;
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>for whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son in
  whom he delighteth.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  Happy is the man that finds wisdom
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth
  understanding;
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>for the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and
  the gain thereof than fine gold.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>She is more precious than rubies; and all the things thou canst desire
  are not to be compared unto her.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and
  honor.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her; and happy is
  everyone that retaineth her.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he
  established the heavens.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the
  dew.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>My son, let not them depart from thine eyes; keep sound wisdom and
  discretion;
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>so
  shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and
  thy foot shall not stumble.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>When thou liest
  down, thou shalt not be afraid; yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep
  shall be sweet.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>Be not afraid of sudden fear,
 </span></block>

 <block><span>neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and
  shall keep thy foot from being taken.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>27</verse><span>Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power
  of thine hand to do it.
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>Say not unto thy neighbor, “Go, and come again, and tomorrow I will
  give;” when thou hast it by thee.
  </span><verse>29</verse><span>Devise not evil against thy neighbor, seeing he dwelleth securely by
  thee.
  </span><verse>30</verse><span>Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no
  harm.
  </span><verse>31</verse><span>Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.
  </span><verse>32</verse><span>For the froward is abomination to the LORD; but his secret is with the
  righteous.
  </span><verse>33</verse><span>The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked; but he blesseth
  the habitation of the just.
  </span><verse>34</verse><span>Surely he scorneth the scorners; but he giveth grace unto the lowly.
  </span><verse>35</verse><span>The wise shall inherit glory; but shame shall be the promotion of
  fools.

  The instruction of a father
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>4
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know
  understanding.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>For I was my father’s son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my
  mother.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>He taught me also, and said unto me, “Let thine heart retain my words;
  keep my commandments, and live.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>Get wisdom, get understanding; forget it not; neither decline from the
  words of my mouth.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee; love her, and she shall
  keep thee.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom; and with all thy
  getting get understanding.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>Exalt her, and she shall promote thee; she shall bring thee to honor,
  when thou dost embrace her.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace; a crown of glory
  shall she deliver to thee.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall
  be many.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right
  paths.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou
  runnest, thou shalt not stumble.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go; keep her; for she is thy
  life.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil
  men.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is
  taken away, unless they cause some to fall.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and
  more unto the perfect day.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>The way of the wicked is as darkness; they know not at what they
  stumble.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine
  heart.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their
  flesh.
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of
  life.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from
  thee.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight
  before thee.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>Turn not to the right hand nor to the left; remove thy foot from
  evil.

  Warning against forbidden women
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>5
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>My son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my understanding;
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>that thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips may keep
  knowledge.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>For the lips of a strange woman drop as a honeycomb, and her mouth is
  smoother than oil;
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>but her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are movable, that
  thou canst not know them.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of
  my mouth.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house;
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>lest thou give thine honor unto others, and thy years unto the cruel;
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labors be in the
  house of a stranger;
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>and thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>and say, “How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>and have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to
  them that instructed me!
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and
  assembly.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine
  own well.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>Let
  thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>Let them be only thine own, and not strangers’
  with thee.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>Let thy fountain be blessed; and
  rejoice with the wife of thy youth.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>Let her be
  as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all
  times; and be thou ravished always with her love.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a
  strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>For the ways of man are before the eyes of the
  LORD, and he pondereth all his goings.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>His own
  iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the
  cords of his sins.
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>He shall die without
  instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy
  hand with a stranger,
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the
  words of thy mouth.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the
  hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird
  from the hand of the fowler.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise;
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the
  harvest.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? When wilt thou arise out of thy
  sleep?
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to
  sleep;
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>so shall thy poverty come as one that traveleth, and thy want as an
  armed man.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with
  his fingers;
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he
  soweth discord.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken
  without remedy.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>These six things doth the LORD hate; yea, seven are an abomination unto
  him:

   <verse>17</verse><span>a proud look,</span></dot>
  <dot><span>a lying tongue,</span></dot>
  <dot><span>and hands that shed innocent blood,</span></dot>
  <dot>
   <verse>18</verse><span>a heart that deviseth wicked imaginations,</span></dot>
  <dot><span>feet that be swift in running to mischief,</span></dot>
  <dot>
   <verse>19</verse><span>a false witness that speaketh lies,</span></dot>

  Warning against adultery

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>My son, keep thy father’s commandment, and forsake not the law of thy
  mother;
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>bind
  them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy neck.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou
  sleepest, it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with
  thee.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of
  instruction are the way of life;
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>to keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of
  a strange women.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>Lust
  not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her
  eyelids.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>For by means of a whorish woman a man
  is brought to a piece of bread; and the adulteress will hunt for the
  precious life.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>27</verse><span>Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?
  </span><verse>29</verse><span>So he that goeth in to his neighbor’s wife; whosoever toucheth her
  shall not be innocent.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>30</verse><span>Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is
  hungry;
  </span><verse>31</verse><span>but if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the
  substance of his house.
  </span><verse>32</verse><span>But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding; he
  that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.
  </span><verse>33</verse><span>A wound and dishonor shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped
  away.
  </span><verse>34</verse><span>For jealousy is the rage of a man; therefore he will not spare in the
  day of vengeance.
  </span><verse>35</verse><span>He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though
  thou givest many gifts.
 </span></block>

 <chapter>7
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>Say unto wisdom, “Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy
  kinswoman;
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>that they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger which
  flattereth with her words.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>and beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths a young
  man void of understanding,
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her
  house.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night;
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>and, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of a harlot, and
  subtile of heart.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>(She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house;
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every
  corner.)
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto
  him,
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>“I have peace offerings with me; this day have I paid my vows.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I
  have found thee.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works,
  with fine linen of Egypt.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning; let us solace
  ourselves with loves.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey;
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>he hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at the day
  appointed.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering
  of her lips she forced him.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as
  a fool to the correction of the stocks;
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare,
  and knoweth not that it is for his life.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words
  of my mouth.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>For she hath cast down many wounded; yea, many strong men have been
  slain by her.
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of
  death.

  </span><verse>2</verse><span>She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the
  paths.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at
  the doors.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>O ye simple, understand wisdom; and, ye fools, be ye of an
  understanding heart.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips
  shall be right
  things.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>For my mouth shall speak truth; and
  wickedness is an abomination to my lips.

  the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing froward or
  perverse in them.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>They are all plain to him
  that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than

  <verse>12</verse><span>I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty

  Wisdom was set up from the beginning
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of
  old.
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth
  was.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no
  fountains abounding with water.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought
  forth;
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>while as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest
  part of the dust of the world.
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>When he prepared the heavens, I was there; when he set a compass upon
  the face of the depth;
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>when he established the clouds above; when he strengthened the
  fountains of the deep;
  </span><verse>29</verse><span>when he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his
  commandment; when he appointed the foundations of the earth;
  </span><verse>30</verse><span>then I was by him, as one brought up with him; and I was daily his
  delight, rejoicing always before him;
  </span><verse>31</verse><span>rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with
  the sons of men.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>32</verse><span>Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children; for blessed are they that
  keep my ways.
  </span><verse>33</verse><span>Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.
  </span><verse>34</verse><span>Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting
  at the posts of my doors.
  </span><verse>35</verse><span>For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favor of the LORD.
  </span><verse>36</verse><span>But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul; all they that
  hate me love death.

  <verse>1</verse><span>Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars;
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>she hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also
  furnished her table.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>She hath sent forth her maidens; she crieth upon the highest places of
  the city.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither; as for him that wanteth
  understanding, she saith to him,
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>“Come, eat of my bread and drink of the wine which I have mingled.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of
  understanding.”

  will love thee.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser; teach a just
  man, and he will increase in learning.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom; and the knowledge of
  the Holy is understanding.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall
  be increased.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself; but if thou scornest,
  thou alone shalt bear it.

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>A foolish woman is clamorous; she is simple, and knoweth nothing.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places
  of the city,
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>to call passengers who go right on their ways;
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>whoso is simple, let him turn in hither; and
  as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>“Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in
  secret is pleasant.”
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>But he knoweth not that

  watered also himself.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>26</verse><span>He that withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him; but blessing

  seeketh mischief, it shall come unto him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>28</verse><span>He that trusteth in his riches shall fall; but the righteous shall
  flourish as a branch.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>29</verse><span>He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind; and the
  fool shall be servant to the wise of heart.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>30</verse><span>The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that winneth
  souls is wise.

  righteous shall stand.
 </span></block>

  a perverse heart shall be despised.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>He that is despised, and hath a servant, is better than he that
  honoreth himself, and lacketh bread.

  followeth vain persons is void of understanding.
 </span></block>

 <block>

  righteous yieldeth fruit.

  shall come out of trouble.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth; and
  the recompense of a man’s hands shall be rendered unto him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>The way of a fool is right in his own eyes; but he that hearkeneth
  unto counsel is wise.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>A fool’s wrath is presently known; but a prudent man covereth
  shame.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>He that speaketh truth showeth forth righteousness; but a false
  witness deceit.
 </span></block>

 <block>

  tongue of the wise is health.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>The lip of truth shall be established forever; but a lying tongue
  is but for a moment.</span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine evil; but to the
  counselors of peace is joy.</span></block>

  maketh it glad.
 </span></block>

 <block>

  <verse>27</verse><span>The slothful man roasteth not that which he took in hunting; but
  the substance of a diligent man is precious.
 </span></block>

  is heaviness.

  <verse>19</verse><span>The evil bow before the good; and the wicked at the gates of the
  righteous.</span></block>

  <verse>20</verse><span>The poor is hated even of his own neighbor; but the rich hath many
  friends.</span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>He that despiseth his neighbor sinneth; but he that hath mercy on
  the poor, happy is he.</span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>Do they not err that devise evil? But mercy and truth shall be to
  them that devise good.</span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>In all labor there is profit; but the talk of the lips tendeth only

 </span></block>

 <block>

  people is the destruction of the prince.
 </span></block>

 <block>

  hasty of spirit exalteth folly.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>30</verse><span>A sound heart is the life of the flesh; but envy the rottenness of
  the bones.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>31</verse><span>He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker; but he that
  honor him hath mercy on the poor.

  reproof is prudent.
 </span></block>

  hearts of the children of men?
 </span></block>

 <block>

  unto the wise.
 </span></block>

  heart the spirit is broken.
 </span></block>

  mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>All the days of the afflicted are evil; but he that is of a merry
  heart hath a continual feast.
 </span></block>

  <verse>16</verse><span>Better is little with the fear of the LORD, than great treasure and
  trouble therewith.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and
  hatred therewith.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>A wrathful man stirreth up strife; but he that is slow to anger
  appeaseth strife.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>The way of the slothful man is as a hedge of thorns; but the way of
  the righteous is made plain.
 </span></block>

  weigheth the spirits.

  established.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>The LORD hath made all things for himself; yea, even the wicked for
  the day of evil.

 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>By mercy and truth iniquity is purged; and by the fear of the LORD
  men depart from evil.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>When a man’s ways please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies to be
  at peace with him.

  right.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>A man’s heart deviseth his way; but the LORD directeth his
  steps.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>A divine sentence is in the lips of the king; his mouth
  transgresseth not in judgment.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>A just weight and balance are the LORD’s; all the weights of the
  bag are his work.
 </span></block>

  <verse>13</verse><span>Righteous lips are the delight of kings; and they love him that
  speaketh right.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>The wrath of a king is as messengers of death; but a wise man will
  pacify it.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>In the light of the king’s countenance is life; and his favor is as
  a cloud of the latter rain.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! And to get
  understanding rather to be chosen than silver!
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>The highway of the upright is to depart from evil; he that keeps
  his way preserveth his soul.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>Pride goeth before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a
  fall.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>Better it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to
  divide the spoil with the proud.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good; and whoso
  trusteth in the LORD, happy is he.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>The wise in heart shall be called prudent; and the sweetness of the
  lips increaseth learning.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>Understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it; but
  the instruction of fools is folly.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning to
  his lips.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>Pleasant words are as a honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to
  the bones.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>25</verse><span>There is a way that seemeth right unto a man; but the end thereof
  are the ways of death.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>26</verse><span>He that laboreth, laboreth for himself; for his mouth craveth it of
  him.
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>An ungodly man diggeth up evil; and in his lips there is as a
  burning fire.
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>A froward man soweth strife; and a whisperer separateth chief
  friends.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>29</verse><span>A violent man enticeth his neighbor, and leadeth him into a way
  that is not good.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>30</verse><span>He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things; moving his lips he
  bringeth evil to pass.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>31</verse><span>The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way of
  righteousness.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>32</verse><span>He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that
  ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>33</verse><span>The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of
  the LORD.
 </span></block>

 <chapter>17</chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than a house full
  of sacrifices with strife.</span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, and
  shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>The fining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold; but the LORD
  trieth the hearts.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips; and a liar giveth ear to a
  naughty tongue.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker; and he that is glad at
  calamities shall not be unpunished.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>Children’s children are the crown of old men; and the glory of children
  are their fathers.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>Excellent speech becometh not a fool; much less do lying lips a
  prince.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it;
  whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that repeateth a
  matter separateth very friends.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>A reproof entereth more into a wise man than a hundred stripes into a
  fool.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>An evil man seeketh only rebellion; therefore a cruel messenger shall
  be sent against him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool in his
  folly.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his
  house.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water; therefore
  leave off contention, before it be meddled with.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even
  they both are abomination to the LORD.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing
  he hath no heart to it?
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for
  adversity.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>A man void of understanding striketh hands, and becometh surety in the
  presence of his friend.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>He loveth transgression that loveth strife; and he that exalteth his
  gate seeketh destruction.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>He that hath a froward heart findeth no good; and he that hath a
  perverse tongue falleth into mischief.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow; and the father of a
  fool hath no joy.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>A merry heart doeth good like a medicine; but a broken spirit drieth
  the bones.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>A wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of
  judgment.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>Wisdom is before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of a fool
  are in the ends of the earth.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>25</verse><span>A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bare
  him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>26</verse><span>Also to punish the just is not good, nor to strike princes for
  equity.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>27</verse><span>He that hath knowledge spareth his words; and a man of understanding is
  of an excellent spirit.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>28</verse><span>Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise; and he that
  shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding.
 </span></block>

 <chapter>18
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Through desire, a man, having separated himself, seeketh and
  intermeddleth with all wisdom.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may
  discover itself.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>When the wicked cometh, then cometh also contempt, and with ignominy
  reproach.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>The words of a man’s mouth are as deep waters, and the wellspring of
  wisdom as a flowing brook.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>It is not good to accept the person of the wicked, to overthrow the
  righteous in judgment.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>A fool’s lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for
  strokes.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>A fool’s mouth is his destruction, and his lips are the snare of his
  soul.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the
  innermost parts of the belly.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great
  waster.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>The name of the LORD is a strong tower; the righteous runneth into it,
  and is safe.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>The rich man’s wealth is his strong city, and as a high wall in his own
  conceit.</span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>Before destruction the heart of man is haughty; and before honor is
  humility.</span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>He that answereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly and shame
  unto him.</span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit
  who can bear?</span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise
  seeketh knowledge.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>A man’s gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great
  men.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>He that is first in his own cause seemeth just; but his neighbor cometh
  and searcheth him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the
  mighty.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city; and their
  contentions are like the bars of a castle.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>A man’s belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; and with
  the increase of his lips shall he be filled.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>Death and life are in the power of the tongue; and they that love it
  shall eat the fruit thereof.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>Whoso findeth
  </span><under>
   <note><span>a wife findeth a good thing and</span></note><span>a good wife</span></under><span>
  hath obtained favor of the LORD.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>The poor useth entreaties; but the rich answereth roughly.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>A man that hath friends must show himself friendly; and there is a
  friend that sticketh closer than a brother.
 </span></block>

 <chapter>19
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity, than he that is
  perverse in his lips, and is a fool.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>Also, that the soul be without knowledge, it is not good; and he that
  hasteth with his feet sinneth.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>The foolishness of man perverteth his way; and his heart fretteth
  against the LORD.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his
  neighbor.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>A false witness shall not be unpunished; and he that speaketh lies
  shall not escape.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>Many will entreat the favor of the prince; and every man is a friend to
  him that giveth gifts.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>All the brethren of the poor do hate him; how much more do his friends
  go far from him? He pursueth them with words, yet they are wanting to
  him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul; he that keeps understanding
  shall find good.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>A false witness shall not be unpunished; and he that speaketh lies
  shall perish.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to have rule
  over princes.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and it is his glory to
  pass over a transgression.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>The king’s wrath is as the roaring of a lion; but his favor is as dew
  upon the grass.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>A foolish son is the calamity of his father; and the contentions of a
  wife are a continual dropping.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>House and riches are the inheritance of fathers; and a prudent wife is
  from the LORD.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer
  hunger.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>He that keeps the commandment keeps his own soul; but he that despiseth
  his ways shall die.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and that which
  he hath given will he pay him again.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his
  crying.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment; for if thou deliver him,
  yet thou must do it again.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise in thy
  latter end.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>There are many devices in a man’s heart; nevertheless the counsel of
  the LORD, that shall stand.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>The desire of a man is his kindness; and a poor man is better than a
  liar.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>The fear of the LORD tendeth to life; and he that hath it shall abide
  satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>A slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom, and will not so much as
  bring it to his mouth again.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>25</verse><span>Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware; and reprove one that hath
  understanding, and he will understand knowledge.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>26</verse><span>He that wasteth his father, and chaseth away his mother, is a son that

  <verse>10</verse><span>Cast out the scorner, and contention shall go out; yea, strife and
  reproach shall cease.</span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>He that loveth pureness of heart, for the grace of his lips the king
  shall be his friend.</span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>For the eyes of the LORD preserve knowledge; but he overthroweth the
  words of the transgressor.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>The slothful man saith, “There is a lion without, I shall be slain in

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child; but the rod of correction
  shall drive it far from him.

  The words of the wise
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>Bow down thine ear, and hear the words of the wise, and apply thine
  heart unto my knowledge.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>For it is a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee; they shall
  withal be fitted in thy lips.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>That thy trust may be in the LORD, I have made known to thee this day,
  even to thee.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>Have not I written to thee excellent things in counsels and
  knowledge,
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>that I might make thee know the certainty of the words of truth; that
  thou mightest answer the words of truth to them that send unto
  thee?
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>Rob not the poor, because he is poor; neither oppress the afflicted in
  the gate;
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>for the LORD will plead their cause, and spoil the soul of those that
  spoiled them.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>Make no friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man thou shalt
  not go;
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>lest
  thou learn his ways, and get a snare to thy soul.

  thee?

 <block>
  <verse>29</verse><span>Seest thou a man diligent in his business? He shall stand before kings;

 <chapter>23
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what is
  before thee;
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>and put a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man given to appetite.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>Be not desirous of his dainties; for they are deceitful meat.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Labor not to be rich; cease from thine own wisdom.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? For riches certainly
  make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye, neither desire
  thou his dainty meats;
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>for as he thinketh in his heart, so is he; “Eat and drink,” saith he to
  thee; but his heart is not with thee.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, and lose thy
  sweet words.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>Speak not in the ears of a fool; for he will despise the wisdom of thy
  words.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of the
  fatherless;
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>for their Redeemer is mighty; he shall plead their cause with
  thee.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>Apply thine heart unto instruction, and thine ears to the words of
  knowledge.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>Withhold not correction from the child; for if thou beatest him with
  the rod, he shall not die.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from
  hell.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>Yea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right things.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>Let not thine heart envy sinners; but be thou in the fear of the LORD
  all the day long.

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the way.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>Be not among wine bibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh;

  shall clothe a man with rags.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy mother

 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>26</verse><span>My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways.
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>For a whore is a deep ditch; and a strange woman is a narrow pit.

  among men.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>29</verse><span>Who hath woe? Who hath sorrow? Who hath contentions? Who hath babbling?
  Who hath wounds without cause? Who hath redness of eyes?

  they that go to seek mixed wine.
  </span><verse>31</verse><span>Look not thou upon the wine when it is red,
  when it giveth his color in the cup, when it moveth itself aright.
  </span><verse>32</verse><span>At the last it biteth like a serpent, and
  stingeth like an adder.
  </span><verse>33</verse><span>thine eyes shall
  behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter perverse things.
  </span><verse>34</verse><span>Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in
  the midst of the sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast.
  </span><verse>35</verse><span>“They have stricken me,” shalt thou say,” and
  I was not sick; they have beaten me, and I felt it not; when shall I

 <chapter>24

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Be not thou envious against evil men, neither desire to be with them;

 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>Through wisdom is a house builded; and buy understanding it is
  established;
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>and by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and
  pleasant riches.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>A wise man is strong; yea, a man of knowledge increaseth strength.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war; and in multitude of
  counselors there is safety.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>Wisdom is too high for a fool; he openeth not his mouth in the
  gate.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous person.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>The thought of foolishness is sin; and the scorner is an abomination to
  men.

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>If thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death, and those

  </span><verse>12</verse><span>if thou sayest, “Behold, we knew it not; doth not he that pondereth the
  heart consider it? And he that keeps thy soul, doth not he know it? And
  shall not he render to every man according to his works?”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>My son, eat thou honey, because it is good; and the honeycomb, which is

 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>Lay not wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the righteous;
  spoil not his resting- place;
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>for a just man falleth seven times, and riseth up again; but the wicked
  shall fall into mischief.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad
  when he stumbleth;
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>lest the LORD see it, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath
  from him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>Fret not thyself because of evil men, neither be thou envious at the
  wicked;

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>My son, fear thou the LORD and the king; and meddle not with them that
  are given to change.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of
  them both?
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>These things also belong to the wise. It is not good to have respect of
  persons in judgment.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>He that saith unto the wicked, “Thou art righteous; him shall the
  people curse, nations shall abhor him.”
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>But to them that rebuke him shall be delight, and a good blessing shall
  come upon them.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>Every man shall kiss his lips that giveth a right answer.

  <verse>28</verse><span>Be not a witness against thy neighbor without cause; and deceive not
  with thy lips.
  </span><verse>29</verse><span>Say
  not, “I will do so to him as he hath done to me; I will render to the man
  according to his work.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>30</verse><span>I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man
  void of understanding;
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>31</verse><span>and, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered the
  face thereof, and
 </span></block>

 <block><span>the stone wall thereof was broken down.
  </span><verse>32</verse><span>Then I saw, and considered it well; I looked
  upon it, and received instruction.
  </span><verse>33</verse><span>Yet a
  little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep;
  </span><verse>34</verse><span>so shall thy poverty come as one that
  traveleth; and thy want as an armed man.

  <verse>19</verse><span>Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken
  tooth, and a foot out of joint.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>As he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, and as vinegar upon
  nitre, so is he that singeth songs to a heavy heart.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty,
  give him water to drink;
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>for thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD shall
  reward thee.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>The north wind driveth away rain; so doth an angry countenance a
  backbiting tongue.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a
  brawling woman and in a wide house.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>25</verse><span>As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far
  country.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>26</verse><span>A righteous man falling down before the wicked is as a troubled
  fountain, and a corrupt spring.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>27</verse><span>It is not good to eat much honey; so for men to search their own glory
  is not glory.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>28</verse><span>He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken
  down, and without walls.
 </span></block>

 <chapter>26</chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honor is not seemly
  for a fool.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse
  causeless shall not come.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the
  fool’s back.</span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like
  unto him.</span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own
  conceit.</span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off the
  feet, and drinketh damage.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>The legs of the lame are not equal; so is a parable in the mouth of
  fools.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>As he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so is he that giveth honor
  to a fool.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>As a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so is a parable in
  the mouth of fools.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>The great God that formed all things both rewardeth the fool, and
  rewardeth transgressors.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>As a dog returneth to his vomit, so a fool returneth to his
  folly.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? There is more hope of a
  fool than of him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>The slothful man saith, “There is a lion in the way; a lion is in
  the streets.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>As the door turneth upon his hinges, so doth the slothful upon his
  bed.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>The slothful hideth his hand in his bosom; it grieveth him to bring
  it again to his mouth.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can
  render a reason.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>He that passeth by, and meddleth with strife belonging not to him,
  is like one that taketh a dog by the ears.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>As a mad man who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death,
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>So is the man that deceiveth his neighbor, and saith, “Am not I in
  sport?”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>Where no wood is, there the fire goeth out; so where there is no
  talebearer, the strife ceaseth.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire; so is a
  contentious man to kindle strife.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the
  innermost parts of the belly.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>Burning lips and a wicked heart are like a potsherd covered with
  silver dross.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit
  within him;</span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>25</verse><span>when he speaketh fair, believe him not; for there are seven
  abominations in his heart.</span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>26</verse><span>Whose hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be showed
  before the whole congregation.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>27</verse><span>Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein; and he that rolleth a
  stone, it will return upon him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>28</verse><span>A lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it; and a
  flattering mouth worketh ruin.
 </span></block>

 <chapter>27</chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Boast not thyself of tomorrow; for thou knowest not what a day may
  bring forth.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a stranger,
  and not thine own lips.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool’s wrath is
  heavier than them both.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is able to stand
  before envy?
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>Open rebuke is better than secret love.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy are
  deceitful.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>The full soul loatheth a honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every
  bitter thing is sweet.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so is a man that wandereth
  from his place.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart; so doth the sweetness of a
  man’s friend by hearty counsel.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>Thine own friend, and thy father’s friend, forsake not; neither go
  into thy brother’s house in the day of thy calamity; for better is a
  neighbor that is near than a brother far off.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that
  reproacheth me.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself; but the
  simple pass on, and are punished.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a pledge
  of him for a strange woman.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the
  morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman
  are alike.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his right
  hand, which bewrayeth itself.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his
  friend.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>Whoso keeps the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof; so he that
  waiteth on his master shall be honored.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>As in water face answereth to face, so the heart of man to
  man.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never
  satisfied.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>As the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so is a man
  to his praise.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a
  pestle, yet will not his foolishness depart from him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, and look well to
  thy herds;
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>for riches are not forever; and doth the crown endure to every
  generation?
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>The hay appeareth, and the tender grass showeth itself, and herbs
  of the mountains are gathered.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>The lambs are for thy clothing, and the goats are the price of the
  field.
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>And thou shalt have goats’ milk enough for thy food, for the food
  of thy household, and for the maintenance for thy maidens.

 <chapter>28</chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>The wicked flee when no man pursueth; but the righteous are bold as
  a lion.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof; but
  by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be
  prolonged.</span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>A poor man that oppresseth the poor is like a sweeping rain which
  leaveth no food.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>They that forsake the law praise the wicked; but such as keep the law
  contend with them.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>Evil men understand not judgment; but they that seek the LORD
  understand all things.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>Better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness, than he that is
  perverse in his ways, though he be rich.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>Whoso keeps the law is a wise son; but he that is a companion of
  riotous men shameth his father.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he shall
  gather it for him that will pity the poor.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer
  shall be abomination.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way, he shall fall
  himself into his own pit; but the upright shall have good things in
  possession.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>The rich man is wise in his own conceit; but the poor that hath
  understanding searcheth him out.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>When righteous men do rejoice, there is great glory; but when the
  wicked rise, a man is hidden.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>He that covereth his sins shall not prosper; but whoso confesseth and
  forsaketh them shall have mercy.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>Happy is the man that feareth always; but he that hardeneth his heart
  shall fall into mischief.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>As a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; so is a wicked ruler over the
  poor people.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>The prince that wanteth understanding is also a great oppressor; but he
  that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>A man that doeth violence to the blood of any person shall flee to the
  pit; let no man stay him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved; but he that is perverse in his
  ways shall fall at once.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread; but he that
  followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>A faithful man shall abound with blessings; but he that maketh haste to
  be rich shall not be innocent.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>To have respect of persons is not good; for, for a piece of bread that
  man will transgress.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>He that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye, and considereth not that
  poverty shall come upon him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>He that rebuketh a man, afterwards shall find more favor than he that
  flattereth with the tongue.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, “It is no
  transgression;” the same is the companion of a destroyer.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>25</verse><span>He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife; but he that putteth his
  trust in the LORD shall be made fat.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>26</verse><span>He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool; but whoso walketh wisely,
  he shall be delivered.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>27</verse><span>He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack; but he that hideth his
  eyes shall have many a curse.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>28</verse><span>When the wicked rise, men hide themselves; but when they perish, the
  righteous increase.
 </span></block>

 <chapter>29
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>He, that being often reproved hardeneth his neck, shall suddenly be
  destroyed, and that without remedy.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice; but when the
  wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>Whoso loveth wisdom rejoices his father; but he that keeps company with
  harlots spendeth his substance.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>The king by judgment establisheth the land; but he that receiveth gifts
  overthroweth it.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>A man that flattereth his neighbor spreadeth a net for his feet.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare; but the righteous
  doth sing and rejoice.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>The righteous considereth the cause of the poor; but the wicked
  regardeth not to know it.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>Scornful men bring a city into a snare; but wise men turn away
  wrath.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>If a wise man contendeth with a foolish man, whether he rage or laugh,
  there is no rest.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>The bloodthirsty hate the upright; but the just seek his soul.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>A fool uttereth all his mind; but a wise man keeps it in till
  afterwards.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>If a ruler hearken to lies, all his servants are wicked.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>The poor and the deceitful man meet together; the LORD lighteneth both
  their eyes.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>The king that faithfully judgeth the poor, his throne shall be
  established forever.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>The rod and reproof give wisdom; but a child left to himself bringeth
  his mother to shame.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increaseth; but the
  righteous shall see their fall.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; yea, he shall give
  delight unto thy soul.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>Where there is no vision, the people perish; but he that keeps the law,
  happy is he.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>A servant will not be corrected by words; for though he understand he
  will not answer.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words? There is more hope of a
  fool than of him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him
  become his son at the length.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>An angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth in
  transgression.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>A man’s pride shall bring him low; but honor shall uphold the humble in
  spirit.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul; he heareth cursing,
  and bewrayeth it not.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>25</verse><span>The fear of man bringeth a snare; but whoso putteth his trust in the
  LORD shall be safe.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>26</verse><span>Many seek the ruler’s favor; but every man’s judgment cometh from the
  LORD.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>27</verse><span>An unjust man is an abomination to the just; and he that is upright in
  the way is abomination to the wicked.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>The words of Agur</span></heading>

<chapter>30</chapter>
 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy:</span></block>

 <block><span>
  The man spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal,
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>“Surely I am more brutish than any man, and
  have not the understanding of a man.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>I
  neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>Who hath ascended up into heaven, or
  descended? Who hath gathered the wind in his fists? Who hath bound the
  waters in a garment? Who hath established all the ends of the earth?
  What is his name, and what is his son’s name, if thou canst tell?”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>Every word of God is pure; he is a shield unto them that put their
  trust in him.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be
  found a liar.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>Two things have I required of thee; deny me them not before I die;
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>remove far from me vanity and lies; give me neither poverty nor
  riches; feed me with food convenient for me;
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, “Who is the LORD?” Or lest
  I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, and thou
  be found guilty.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>There is a generation that curseth their father, and doth not bless
  their mother.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet is
  not washed from their filthiness.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>There is a generation, oh how lofty are their eyes! And their
  eyelids are lifted up.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>There
  is a generation, whose teeth are as swords, and their jaw teeth as
  knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from
  among men.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>The horseleech hath two daughters, crying, “Give, give.” There are
  three things that are never satisfied, yea, four things say not, “It
  is enough”:
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>the grave; and the barren womb; the earth that is not filled with
  water; and the fire that saith not, “It is enough.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>The eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his
  mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young
  eagles shall eat it.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>There be three things which are too wonderful for me, yea, four
  which I know not;
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>the
  way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the way
  of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her
  mouth, and saith, “I have done no wickedness.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>For three things the earth is disquieted, and for four which it
  cannot bear;
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>for a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled with
  meat;
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>for an odious woman when she is married; and a handmaid that is
  heir to her mistress.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>There be four things which are little upon the earth, but they are
  exceeding wise:
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>the
  ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the
  summer;
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>the conies are but a feeble folk,
  yet make they their houses in the rocks;
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>the locusts have no king, yet go they
  forth all of them by bands;
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>the spider
  taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings’ palaces.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>29</verse><span>There be three things which go well, yea, four are comely in going:
  </span><verse>30</verse><span>a lion, which is strongest among beasts, and turneth not away from
  any;
  </span><verse>31</verse><span>a greyhound; a he goat also; and a king, against whom there is no
  rising up.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>32</verse><span>If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast
  thought evil, lay thine hand upon thy mouth.
  </span><verse>33</verse><span>Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the wringing
  of the nose bringest forth blood; so the forcing of wrath bringeth
  forth strife.

 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>What, my son? And what, the son of my womb? And what, the son of my
  vows?
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>Give
  not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for
  kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink;
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>lest they drink, and forget the law, and
  pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>Give strong drink unto him that is ready to
  perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and
  remember his misery no more.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>Open thy mouth for
  the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead
  the cause of the poor and needy.

  </span><verse>12</verse><span>She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands.

  household, and a portion to her maidens.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>She considereth a field, and buyeth it; with the fruit of her hands she
