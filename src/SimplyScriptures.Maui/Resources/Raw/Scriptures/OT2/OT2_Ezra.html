    <verse>1</verse><span>Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the
    LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the LORD stirred up
    the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation
    throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying:</span><quote>
     <verse>2</verse><span>Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia: The LORD God of heaven hath given me
     all the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me to build him a
     house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>Who is there among you of all his people? His God be with him, and let
     him go up to Jerusalem, which is Judah, and build the house of the LORD
     God of Israel, (he is the God) which is in Jerusalem.
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let the men
     of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and
     with beasts, besides the freewill offering for the house of God that is
     in Jerusalem.</span></quote>
   </block>

   <block>
    <verse>5</verse><span>Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the
    priests, and the Levites, with all them whose spirit God had raised, to
    go up to build the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem.
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>And all they that were about them strengthened their hands with vessels
    of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious
    things, besides all that was willingly offered.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>7</verse><span>Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the LORD,
    which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put
    them in the house of his gods;
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of
    Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar, the prince
    of Judah.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>9</verse><span>And this is the number of them: thirty chargers of gold, a thousand
    chargers of silver, nine and twenty knives,
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>thirty basins of gold, silver basins of a second sort four hundred and
    ten, and other vessels a thousand.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>11</verse><span>All the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four
    hundred. All these did Sheshbazzar bring up with them of the captivity
    that were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem.

    </span><verse>5</verse><span>And at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness; and having
    rent my garment and my mantle, I fell upon my knees, and spread out my
    hands unto the LORD my God,
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>and said:</span><quote>
     <block><span>
      O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee, my God; for
      our iniquities are increased over our head, and our trespass is grown up
      unto the heavens.</span></block>

      <verse>7</verse><span>Since the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass unto
      this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and our priests,
      been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to
      captivity, and to a spoil, and to confusion of face, as it is this
      day.</span></block>

      <verse>8</verse><span>And now for a little space grace hath been showed from the LORD our
      God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy
      place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving
      in our bondage.
      </span><verse>9</verse><span>For we were bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage,
      but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to
      give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair the
      desolations thereof, and to give us a wall in Judah and in
      Jerusalem.</span></block>

     <block>
      <verse>10</verse><span>And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? For we have forsaken
      thy commandments,
      </span><verse>11</verse><span>which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets, saying, “The
      land, unto which ye go to possess it, is an unclean land with the
      filthiness of the people of the lands, with their abominations, which
      have filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness.
      </span><verse>12</verse><span>Now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither take
      their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or their wealth
      forever; that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave
      it for an inheritance to your children forever.”</span></block>

     <block>
      <verse>13</verse><span>And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our
      great trespass, seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than our
      iniquities deserve, and hast given us such deliverance as this;
      </span><verse>14</verse><span>should we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity with the
      people of these abominations? Wouldest not thou be angry with us till
      thou hadst consumed us, so that there should be no remnant nor escaping?
      </span><verse>15</verse><span>O LORD God of Israel, thou art righteous; for we remain yet escaped, as
      it is this day; behold, we are before thee in our trespasses; for we
      cannot stand before thee because of this.</span></block>

    <verse>1</verse><span>Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and
    casting himself down before the house of God, there assembled unto him
    out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children;
    for the people wept very sore.
    </span><verse>2</verse><span>And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and
    said unto Ezra:</span><quote><span>
     We have trespassed against our God, and have taken strange wives of the
     people of the land; yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing.
     </span><verse>3</verse><span>Now therefore let us make a covenant with our
     God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to
     the counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of
     our God; and let it be done according to the law.
     </span><verse>4</verse><span>Arise; for this matter belongeth unto thee; we
     also will be with thee; be of good courage, and do it.

    <verse>5</verse><span>Then arose Ezra, and made the chief priests, the Levites, and all
    Israel, to swear that they should do according to this word. And they
    sware.
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the
    chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib; and when he came thither, he did
    eat no bread, nor drink water; for he mourned because of the
    transgression of them that had been carried away.

    <verse>7</verse><span>And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the
    children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together
    unto Jerusalem;
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>and that whosoever would not come within three days, according to the
    counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be
    forfeited, and himself separated from the congregation of those that had
    been carried away.

    <verse>9</verse><span>Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together
    unto Jerusalem within three days. It was the ninth month, on the
    twentieth day of the month; and all the people sat in the street of the
    house of God, trembling because of this matter, and for the great rain.
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them:</span><quote><span>
     Ye have transgressed, and have taken strange wives, to increase the
     trespass of Israel.
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>Now therefore make
     confession unto the LORD God of your fathers, and do his pleasure; and
     separate yourselves from the people of the land, and from the strange
     wives.

    <verse>12</verse><span>Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice:</span><quote><span>
     As thou hast said, so must we do.
     </span><verse>13</verse><span>But the
     people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we are not able to
     stand without, neither is this a work of one day or two; for we are many
     that have transgressed in this thing.
     </span><verse>14</verse><span>Let now
     our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all them which have
     taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed times, and with them
     the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath
     of our God for this matter be turned from us.
