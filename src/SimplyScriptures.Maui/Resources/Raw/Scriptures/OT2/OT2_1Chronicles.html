    the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchi- Shua, the sons

    </span><verse>3</verse><span>And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him, and he
    was wounded of the archers.
    </span><verse>4</verse><span>Then said Saul to his armor-bearer, “Draw thy sword, and thrust me
    through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me.” But his
    armor-bearer would not; for he was sore afraid. So Saul took a sword and
    fell upon it.
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>And when his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise on

    the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa.
    </span><verse>9</verse><span>And when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his armor, and
    sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry tidings unto
    their idols, and to the people.
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>And they put his armor in the house of their gods and fastened his head

      Furthermore I tell thee, that the LORD will build thee a house.
      </span><verse>11</verse><span>And it shall come to pass when thy days be
      expired that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy
      seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his
      kingdom.
      </span><verse>12</verse><span>He shall build me a house, and I will
      stablish his throne forever.
      </span><verse>13</verse><span>I will be his

      </span><verse>17</verse><span>And yet this was a small thing in

     The LORD make his people a hundred times so many more as they be; but, my

   <block>
    <verse>4</verse><span>Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab

    </span><verse>5</verse><span>And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And all
    they of Israel were a thousand and a hundred thousand men
    that drew sword; and Judah was four hundred three-score and ten thousand
    men that drew sword.
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>But Levi and Benjamin

    <verse>7</verse><span>And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel.

      the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee; or else three days the sword

    <verse>14</verse><span>So the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel; and there fell of Israel

    were clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.
    </span><verse>17</verse><span>And David said unto God:</span><quote><span>
     Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? Even I it is that

    Of the Korhites was Meshelemiah the son of Kore, of the sons of Asaph.
    </span><verse>2</verse><span>And the sons of
    Meshelemiah were, Zechariah the first-born, Jediael the second, Zebadiah

    </span><verse>5</verse><span>Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh, Peulthai the eighth; for God
    blessed him.
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>Also unto Shemaiah his son were sons born, that ruled throughout the
    house of their father; for they were mighty men of valor.
    </span><verse>7</verse><span>The sons of Shemaiah; Othni, and Rephael, and Obed, Elzabad, whose
    brethren were strong men, Elihu, and Semachiah.
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>All these of the sons of Obed-Edom; they and their sons and their
    brethren, able men for strength for the service, were threescore and two
    of Obed-Edom.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>9</verse><span>And Meshelemiah had sons and brethren, strong men, eighteen.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>10</verse><span>Also Hosah, of the children of Merari, had sons; Simri the chief, (for
    though he was not the first­born,yet his father made him the chief)
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third, Zechariah the fourth; all the

    men, having wards one against another, to minister in the house of the
    LORD.
    </span><verse>13</verse><span>And they cast lots, as well the small as the great, according to the
    house of their fathers, for every gate.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>14</verse><span>And the lot eastward fell to Shelemiah. Then for Zechariah his son, a
    wise counselor, they cast lots; and his lot came out northward.
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>To Obed-Edom southward; and to his sons the house of Asuppim.
    </span><verse>16</verse><span>To Shuppim and Hosah the lot came forth westward, with the gate
    Shallecheth, by the causeway of the going up, ward against ward.
    </span><verse>17</verse><span>Eastward were six Levites, northward four a day, southward four a day,
    and toward Asuppim two and two.
    </span><verse>18</verse><span>At Parbar westward, four at the causeway, and two at Parbar.

    </span><verse>25</verse><span>And his brethren by Eliezer; Rehabiah his son, and Jeshaiah his son,

    dedicated.
    </span><verse>27</verse><span>Out of the spoils won in battles did they dedicate to maintain the
    house of the LORD.
    </span><verse>28</verse><span>And all that Samuel the seer, and Saul the son of Kish, and Abner the
    son of Ner, and Joab the son of Zeruiah, had dedicated; and whosoever
    had dedicated anything, it was under the hand of Shelomith, and of his

    </span><verse>31</verse><span>Among the Hebronites was Jerijah the chief, even among the Hebronites,
