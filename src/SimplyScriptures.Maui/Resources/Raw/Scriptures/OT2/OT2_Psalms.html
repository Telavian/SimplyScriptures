 <heading><span>The way of the righteous and of the ungodly
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>1
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor
  standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he
  meditate day and night.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that
  bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither;
  and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>The ungodly are not so; but are like the chaff which the wind driveth
  away.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in
  the congregation of the righteous.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous; but the way of the
  ungodly shall perish.
 </span></block>

 <chapter>2
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel
  together, against the LORD, and against his Anointed, saying,
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>“Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from
  us.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh; the LORD shall have them in
  derision.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>Then
  shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore
  displeasure.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>Yet have I set my King upon my
  holy hill of Zion.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>I will declare the decree; the LORD hath said unto me, “Thou art my
  Son; this day have I begotten thee.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and
  the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in
  pieces like a potter’s vessel.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>Be wise now therefore, O ye kings; be instructed, ye judges of the
  earth.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his
  wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust
  in him.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>Save me O my God
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>3
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>LORD, how are they increased that trouble me! Many are they that rise
  up against me.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>Many there be which say of my soul, “There is no help for him in God.”
  Selah.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>But thou, O LORD, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of
  mine head.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy
  hill. Selah.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set
  themselves against me round about.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God; for thou hast smitten all mine
  enemies upon the cheekbone; thou hast broken the teeth of the
  ungodly.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>Salvation belongeth unto the LORD; thy blessing is upon thy people.
  Selah.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  Answer me when I call
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>4
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness; thou hast enlarged me
  when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame? How long
  will ye love vanity, and seek after leasing? Selah.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself;
  the LORD will hear when I call unto him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Stand in awe, and sin not; commune with your own heart upon your bed,
  and be still. Selah.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the
  LORD.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>There be many that say, “Who will show us any good? LORD, lift thou up
  the light of thy countenance upon us.”
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that their
  corn and their wine increased.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep; for thou, LORD, only
  makest me dwell in safety.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  Lead me in righteousness
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>5
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Give ear to my words, O LORD; consider my meditation.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God; for unto thee
  will I pray.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I
  direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness; neither shall
  evil dwell with thee.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>The foolish shall not stand in thy sight; thou hatest all workers of
  iniquity.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing; the LORD will abhor the
  bloody and deceitful man.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy
  mercy; and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy
  way straight before my face.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is very
  wickedness; their throat is an open sepulcher; they flatter with their
  tongue.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast
  them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have
  rebelled against thee.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice; let them ever
  shout for joy, because thou defendest them; let them also that love thy
  name be joyful in thee.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favor wilt thou compass
  him as with a shield.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  O LORD, deliver my soul
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>6
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot
  displeasure.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>Have
  mercy upon me, O LORD; for I am weak; O LORD, heal me; for my bones are
  vexed.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>My soul is also sore vexed; but thou, O LORD, how long?
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Return, O LORD, deliver my soul; oh save me for thy mercies’ sake.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>For in death there is no remembrance of thee; in the grave who shall
  give thee thanks?
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I
  water my couch with my tears.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all
  mine enemies.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath heard the
  voice of my weeping.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my prayer.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed; let them return and be
  ashamed suddenly.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>The LORD shall judge
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>7
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust; save me from all them that
  persecute me, and deliver me;
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is
  none to deliver.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>O LORD my God, if I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands;
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>if I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I
  have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy)
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him tread down
  my life upon the earth, and lay mine honor in the dust. Selah.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of
  mine enemies; and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about; for their
  sakes therefore return thou on high.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>The LORD shall judge the people; judge me, O LORD, according to my
  righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is in me.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the
  just; for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>My defense is of God, which saveth the upright in heart.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every
  day.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made
  it ready.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>He
  hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his
  arrows against the persecutors.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>Behold, he
  travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth
  falsehood.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>He made a pit, and digged it, and
  is fallen into the ditch which he made.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>His
  mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall
  come down upon his own pate.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness; and will sing
  praise to the name of the LORD most high.

  How excellent is thy name
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>8
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>O LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! Who hast
  set thy glory above the heavens.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength
  because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the
  avenger.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the
  stars, which thou hast ordained;
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>what is man, that thou art mindful of him? And the son of man, that
  thou visitest him?
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned
  him with glory and honor.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast
  put all things under his feet;
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field;
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>the fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passeth
  through the paths of the seas.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>O LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!

  All thy marvelous works

 <chapter>9
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>I will praise thee, O LORD, with my whole heart; I will show forth all
  thy marvelous works.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>I will be glad and rejoice in thee; I will sing praise to thy name, O
  thou Most High.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy
  presence.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the
  throne judging right.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou
  hast put out their name forever and ever.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end; and thou hast
  destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>But the LORD shall endure forever; he hath prepared his throne for
  judgment.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister
  judgment to the people in uprightness.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of
  trouble.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And
  they that know thy name will put their trust in thee; for thou, LORD, hast
  not forsaken them that seek thee.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion; declare among the
  people his doings.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them; he
  forgetteth not the cry of the humble.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble which I suffer of them
  that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death;
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>that I may show forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of
  Zion; I will rejoice in thy salvation.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made; in the net which
  they hid is their own foot taken.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>The LORD is known by the judgment which he executeth; the wicked is
  snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget
  God.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>For the needy shall not always be forgotten; the expectation of the
  poor shall not perish forever.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail; let the heathen be judged in thy
  sight.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>Put them in fear, O LORD; that the nations may know themselves to be
  but men. Selah.

 <heading><span>
  Why hidest thou?
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>10</chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Why standest thou
  afar off, O LORD? Why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble?
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>The wicked in his pride doth persecute the
  poor; let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>For the wicked boasteth of his heart’s desire,
  and blesseth the
  covetous, whom the LORD abhorreth.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>The wicked,
  through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God; God is not
  in all his thoughts.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>His ways are always
  grievous; thy judgments are far above out of his sight; as for all his
  enemies, he puffeth at them.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>For he hath said
  in his heart, “I shall not be moved; never in adversity.”
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>His mouth is full of cursing and deceit; and
  </span><dunder><span>his heart is full o</span></dunder><span>f fraud; and under his tongue is mischief and
  vanity.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>He sitteth in the lurking places of the
  villages; in the secret places doth he murder the innocent; his eyes are
  privily set against the poor.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>He lieth in wait
  secretly as a lion in his den; he lieth in wait to catch the poor; he doth
  catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>He croucheth to the strong ones, and humbleth
  himself, that the poor may fall by his
  </span><under>
   <note><span>strong ones</span></note><span>devices</span></under><span>.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>He hath said in his heart, “God hath
  forgotten; he hideth his face; he will never see it.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand;
  forget not the humble.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>The wicked condemn God;
  wherefore he doth say in his heart, “Thou wilt not require
  </span><under>
   <note><span>it</span></note><span>iniquity at my hand</span></under><span>.”
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>O LORD,
  thou hast seen all this, for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite
  it with thy hand. The poor committeth himself unto thee; thou art the
  helper of the fatherless.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>O LORD, thou wilt
  break the arm of the wicked, and of the evil; and seek out his wickedness
  until thou find none that remain.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>And the LORD
  </span><under>

  the
  </span><under>
   <note><span>heathen</span></note><span>wicked</span></under><span>
  shall perish out of his land.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the
  humble; thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear;
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>to judge the fatherless and the oppressed,
  that the man of the earth many no more oppress.‌

  </span><verse>5</verse><span>The LORD loveth the righteous, but the wicked,
  and him that loveth violence, his soul hateth.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire, and
  brimstone, and a horrible tempest, the portion of their cup.

  <italic><span>The servant of the LORD, who spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day that the
  LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul; and he said:</span></italic>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my

  salvation, and my high tower.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>I will call upon the LORD, for he is worthy to be praised; so shall I
  be saved from mine enemies.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made
  me afraid.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented
  me.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God; he heard
  my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his
  ears.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills
  moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth
  devoured; coals were kindled by it.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was under his
  feet.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly; yea, he
  did fly upon the wings of the wind.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>He made
  darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him were dark waters
  and thick clouds of the skies.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>At the
  brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed, hailstones and
  coals of fire.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice;
  hailstones and coals of fire.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out
  lightnings, and discomfited them.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world
  were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy
  nostrils.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me; for
  they were too strong for me.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>They prevented me in the day of my calamity; but the LORD was my stay.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>He
  brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he
  delighted in me.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the
  cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed
  from my God.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his
  statutes from me.
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness,
  according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.

 <block>
  <verse>25</verse><span>With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful; with an upright man
  thou wilt show thyself upright;
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>with the pure thou wilt show thyself pure; and with the froward thou
  wilt show thyself froward.
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high
  looks.
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>For thou wilt light my candle; the LORD my God will enlighten my
  darkness.
  </span><verse>29</verse><span>For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped
  over a wall.
  </span><verse>30</verse><span>O God, thy ways are perfect; the word of the LORD is tried; he is a
  buckler to all those who trust in him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>31</verse><span>For who is God save the LORD? Or who is a rock save our God,
  </span><verse>32</verse><span>our God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect?
  </span><verse>33</verse><span>He maketh my feet like hinds’ feet, and setteth me upon my high places.
  </span><verse>34</verse><span>He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine
  arms.
  </span><verse>35</verse><span>Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation; and thy right hand
  hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.
  </span><verse>36</verse><span>Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.
  </span><verse>37</verse><span>I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them; neither did I turn
  again till they were consumed.
  </span><verse>38</verse><span>I have wounded them that they were not able to rise; they are fallen
  under my feet.
  </span><verse>39</verse><span>For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle; thou hast
  subdued under me those that rose up against me.
  </span><verse>40</verse><span>Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy
  them that hate me.
  </span><verse>41</verse><span>They cried, but found none to save; unto the LORD, but he answered them
  not.
  </span><verse>42</verse><span>Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind; I did cast them
  out as the dirt in the streets.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>43</verse><span>Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and thou hast
  made me the head of the heathen; a people whom I have not known shall
  serve me.
  </span><verse>44</verse><span>As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me; the strangers shall
  submit themselves unto me.
  </span><verse>45</verse><span>The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close
  places.

  <verse>46</verse><span>The LORD liveth; and blessed be my Rock; and let the God of my

  </span><verse>47</verse><span>It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.
  </span><verse>48</verse><span>He delivereth me from mine enemies; yea, thou liftest me up above those
  that rise up against me; thou hast delivered me from the violent
  man.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>49</verse><span>Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and
  sing praises unto thy name.

  </span><verse>16</verse><span>with hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their
  teeth.

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>LORD, how long wilt thou look on? Rescue my soul from their
  destructions, my darling from the lions.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>I will give thee thanks in the great congregation; I will praise thee
  among much people.

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me; neither
  let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>For they speak not peace; but they devise deceitful matters against
  them that are quiet in the land.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, and said, “Aha, aha, our
  eye hath seen it.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>This thou hast seen, O LORD; keep not silence; O LORD, be not far from
  me.
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, even unto my cause, my God
  and my LORD.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; and let them
  not rejoice over me.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>Let them not say in their hearts, “Ah, so would we have it;” let them
  not say, “We have swallowed him up.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>26</verse><span>Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at
  mine hurt; let them be clothed with shame and dishonor that magnify
  themselves against me.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>27</verse><span>Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favor my righteous cause;
  yea, let them say continually, “Let the LORD be magnified, which hath
  pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.”
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy praise all
  the day long.

  <verse>1</verse><span>The wicked, who live in transgression, saith in
  their hearts,
  </span><dunder><span>“There is no condemnation;”</span></dunder><span>
  for there is no fear of
  God before their eyes.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>For they flatter
  themselves in their own eyes, until their iniquities are found to be
  hateful.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>The words of their mouth are full of
  iniquity and deceit. The wicked man hath left off to be wise, and to do
  good;
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>he deviseth mischief upon his bed; he
  setteth himself in a way that is not good.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>O LORD, thou art in the heavens; they are full

  </span><dunder><span>And the thoughts of a righteous man ascendeth up unto thee whose throne is far above the clouds.</span></dunder>
  <verse>6</verse><span>He is filled with thy righteousness like the
  great mountains, and with thy judgments like a great deep. O LORD, thou
  preservest man and beast.

  </span><verse>8</verse><span>They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and
  thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>For with thee is the fountain of life; in thy light shall we see
  light.

  <verse>10</verse><span>Oh continue thy loving-kindness unto them that know thee; and thy

  <verse>1</verse><span>Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against
  the workers of iniquity.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green
  herb.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>Trust in the LORD, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land, and
  verily thou shalt be fed.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>Delight thyself also in the LORD; and he shall give thee the desires of

  <verse>5</verse><span>Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall bring it

  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him; fret not thyself because
  of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked
  devices to pass.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>Cease from anger, and forsake wrath; fret not thyself in any wise to do
  evil.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>For evildoers shall be cut off; but those that wait upon the LORD, they
  shall inherit the earth.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be; yea, thou shalt
  diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in
  the abundance of peace.

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast
  down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be of upright conversation.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be
  broken.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many
  wicked.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>For the arms of the wicked shall be broken; but the LORD upholdeth the
  righteous.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>The LORD knoweth the days of the upright; and their inheritance shall
  be forever.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>They shall not be ashamed in the evil time; and in the days of famine
  they shall be satisfied.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall be as
  the fat of lambs; they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume

 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again; but the righteous showeth
  mercy, and giveth.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and they that be
  cursed of him shall be cut off.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD; and he delighteth in

  upholdeth him with his hand.

 <block>
  <verse>25</verse><span>I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous
  forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>He is ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>27</verse><span>Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell forevermore.
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are
  preserved forever; but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.
  </span><verse>29</verse><span>The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein forever.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>30</verse><span>The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of

  </span><verse>31</verse><span>The
  law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>32</verse><span>The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.
  </span><verse>33</verse><span>The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is
  judged.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>34</verse><span>Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit
  the land; when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>35</verse><span>I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a
  green bay tree.
  </span><verse>36</verse><span>Yet
  he passed away, and, lo, he was not; yea, I sought him, but he could not
  be found.

  <verse>37</verse><span>Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright; for the end of that man

  wicked shall come, and they shall be cut off.

  <verse>1</verse><span>O LORD, rebuke me not in thy wrath; neither chasten me in thy hot

 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither is
  there any rest in my bones because of my sin.

  too heavy for me.

  <verse>5</verse><span>My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.

  found in my flesh.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>I am feeble, and broken, and very sore. I have wept by reason of the
  disquietness of my heart.

  <verse>9</verse><span>LORD, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from
  thee.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>My heart panteth, my strength faileth me; as for the light of mine

  stand afar off.

  <verse>12</verse><span>They also that seek after my life lay snares for me; and they that seek
  my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that openeth
  not his mouth.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no
  reproofs.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>For in thee, O LORD, do I hope; thou wilt hear, O LORD my God.

  my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before me.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong; and they that hate me
  wrongfully are multiplied.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I
  follow the thing that good is.

  Our sins are not hid from God
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>69
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing; I am come into deep
  waters, where the floods overflow me.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>I am weary of my crying; my throat is dried; mine eyes fail while I
  wait for my God.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head;
  they that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty;
  then I restored that which I took not away.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from
  thee.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>Let not them that wait on thee, O LORD God of hosts, be ashamed for my
  sake; let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of
  Israel.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother’s
  children.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of
  them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to my
  reproach.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>They that sit in the gate speak against me, and I was the song of the
  drunkards.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O LORD, in an acceptable time; O
  God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy
  salvation.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink; let me be delivered
  from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>Let not the waterflood overflow me,
  neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth
  upon me.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>Here me, O LORD; for thy loving-kindness is good; turn unto me
  according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble; hear me
  speedily.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it; deliver me because of mine
  enemies.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonor; mine
  adversaries are all before thee.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness; and I looked
  for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I
  found none.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me
  vinegar to drink.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>Let their table become a snare before them; and that which should have
  been for their welfare, let it become a trap.
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins
  continually to shake.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take
  hold of them.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their tents.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the
  grief of those whom thou hast wounded.
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>Add iniquity unto their iniquity; and let them not come into thy
  righteousness.
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written
  with the righteous.</span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>29</verse><span>But I am poor and sorrowful; let thy salvation, O God, set me up on
  high.
  </span><verse>30</verse><span>I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with
  thanksgiving.
  </span><verse>31</verse><span>This also shall please the LORD better than an ox or bullock that hath
  horns and hooves.
  </span><verse>32</verse><span>The humble shall see this, and be glad; and your heart shall live that
  seek God.
  </span><verse>33</verse><span>For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>34</verse><span>Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and everything that
  moveth therein.
  </span><verse>35</verse><span>For
  God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah; that they may
  dwell there, and have it in possession.
  </span><verse>36</verse><span>The
  seed also of his servants shall inherit it; and they that love his name
  shall dwell therein.

  <verse>1</verse><span>Make haste, O God, to deliver me; make haste to help me, O LORD.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul; let them be
  turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say, “Aha,
  aha.”

  </span><verse>2</verse><span>Deliver me in thy righteousness, and cause me to escape; incline thine
  ear unto me, and save me.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually resort; thou
  hast given commandment to save me; for thou art my rock and my
  fortress.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the hand of
  the unrighteous and cruel man.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>For thou art my hope, O Lord GOD; thou art my trust from my youth.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>By thee have I been holden up from the womb; thou art he that took me
  out of my mother’s bowels; my praise shall be continually of thee.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>I am as a wonder unto many; but thou art my strong refuge.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>Let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honor all the day.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength
  faileth.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>For mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for my soul
  take counsel together,
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>saying, “God hath forsaken him; persecute and take him; for there is
  none to deliver him.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>O God, be not far from me; O my God, make haste for my help.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>Let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my soul;
  let them be covered with reproach and dishonor that seek my hurt.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and more.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>My mouth shall show forth thy righteousness and thy salvation all the
  day; for I know not the numbers thereof.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD; I will make mention of thy
  righteousness, even of thine only.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>O God, thou hast taught me from my youth; and hitherto have I declared
  thy wondrous works.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>Now also when I am old and gray-headed, O God, forsake me not; until I
  have showed thy strength unto this generation, and thy power to everyone
  that is to come.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>Thy righteousness also, O God, is very high, who hast done great
  things; O God, who is like unto thee!
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>Thou, which hast showed me great and sore troubles, shalt quicken me
  again, and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>I will also praise thee with the psaltery, even thy truth, O my God;
  unto thee will I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel.
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my soul, which
  thou hast redeemed.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long; for
  they are confounded, for they are brought unto shame, that seek my
  hurt.

  <verse>1</verse><span>Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto the

  </span><verse>2</verse><span>He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with
  judgment.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little hills, by
  righteousness.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of

  </span><verse>11</verse><span>Yea, all kings shall fall down before him; all nations shall serve
  him.

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and him
  that hath no helper.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of the
  needy.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence; and precious shall

 <chapter>73

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well-nigh
  slipped.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the
  wicked.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>For there are no bands in their death; but their strength is firm.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued like
  other men.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth
  them as a garment.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>Their eyes stand out with fatness; they have more than heart could
  wish.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression; they speak
  loftily.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh
  through the earth.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>Therefore his people return hither; and waters of a full cup are wrung
  out to them.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And they say, “How doth God know? And is there knowledge in the Most
  High?”
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase
  in riches.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in
  innocency.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>If I say, “I will speak thus;” behold, I should offend against the
  generation of thy children.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their
  end.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>Surely thou didst set them in slippery places; thou castedst them down
  into destruction.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! They are utterly
  consumed with terrors.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>As a dream when one awaketh; so, O LORD, when thou awakest, thou shalt
  despise their image.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>So foolish was I, and ignorant; I was as a beast before thee.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>Nevertheless I am continually with thee; thou hast holden me by my
  right hand.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>Thou
  shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>Whom have I in heaven but thee? And there is
  none upon earth that I desire besides thee.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>My
  flesh and my heart faileth; but God is the strength of my heart, and my
  portion forever.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>27</verse><span>For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish; thou hast destroyed
  all them that go a whoring from thee.
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>But it is good for me to draw near to God; I have put my trust in the
  Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.

  thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion, wherein
  thou hast dwelt.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all that the
  enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up their
  ensigns for signs.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick
  trees.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and

  </span><verse>7</verse><span>They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by casting
  down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>They said in their hearts, “Let us destroy them together;” they have
  burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.

  <verse>9</verse><span>We see not our signs; there is no more any prophet; neither is there

  thy name forever?
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? Pluck it out of thy
  bosom.

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.

  the dragons in the waters.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him to be
  meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood; thou driedst up mighty
  rivers.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>The day is thine, the night also is thine; thou hast prepared the light

  </span><verse>17</verse><span>Thou hast set all the borders of the earth; thou hast made summer and
  winter.

  </span><verse>11</verse><span>and forgat his works, and his wonders that he had showed them.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>Marvelous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of
  Egypt, in the field of Zoan.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>He divided the sea, and
  caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as a heap.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>In the daytime also he led them with a cloud,
  and all the night with a light of fire.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>He
  clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great
  depths.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>He brought streams also out of the
  rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the Most High in the
  wilderness.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>Yea, they spake against God; they said, “Can God furnish a table in the
  wilderness?
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams
  overflowed; can he give bread also? Can he provide flesh for his
  people?”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth; so a fire was kindled
  against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation;
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of
  heaven,
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>and had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the
  corn of heaven.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>Man did eat angels’ food; he sent them meat to the full.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven; and by his power he
  brought in the south wind.
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the
  sand of the sea;
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>and he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their
  habitations.
  </span><verse>29</verse><span>So they did eat, and were well filled; for he gave them their own
  desire;
  </span><verse>30</verse><span>they were not estranged from their lust; but while their meat was yet
  in their mouths,
  </span><verse>31</verse><span>the wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and
  smote down the chosen men of Israel.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>32</verse><span>For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous
  works.
  </span><verse>33</verse><span>Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in
  trouble.
  </span><verse>34</verse><span>When he slew them, then they sought him; and they returned and inquired
  early after God.
  </span><verse>35</verse><span>And they remembered that God was their Rock, and the high God their
  Redeemer.
  </span><verse>36</verse><span>Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto
  him with their tongues.
  </span><verse>37</verse><span>For their heart was not right with him, neither were they steadfast in
  his covenant.
  </span><verse>38</verse><span>But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed
  them not; yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up
  all his wrath.
  </span><verse>39</verse><span>For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away,
  and cometh not again.
  </span><verse>40</verse><span>How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the
  desert!
  </span><verse>41</verse><span>Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of
  Israel.
  </span><verse>42</verse><span>They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from
  the enemy;
  </span><verse>43</verse><span>how he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of
  Zoan;
  </span><verse>44</verse><span>and had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they
  could not drink.
  </span><verse>45</verse><span>He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and
  frogs, which destroyed them.
  </span><verse>46</verse><span>He gave also their increase unto the caterpillar, and their labor unto
  the locust.
  </span><verse>47</verse><span>He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycamore trees with
  frost.
  </span><verse>48</verse><span>He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot
  thunderbolts.
  </span><verse>49</verse><span>He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation,
  and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.
  </span><verse>50</verse><span>He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but
  gave their life over to the pestilence;
  </span><verse>51</verse><span>and smote all the first- born in Egypt; the chief of their strength in
  the tabernacles of Ham;
  </span><verse>52</verse><span>but made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the
  wilderness like a flock.
  </span><verse>53</verse><span>And he led them on safely, so that they feared not; but the sea
  overwhelmed their enemies.
  </span><verse>54</verse><span>And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this
  mountain, which his right hand had purchased.
  </span><verse>55</verse><span>He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an
  inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their
  tents.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>56</verse><span>Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his
  testimonies;
  </span><verse>57</verse><span>but
  turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers; they were turned
  aside like a deceitful bow.
  </span><verse>58</verse><span>For they provoked
  him to anger with their high places, and moved him to
 </span></block>

 <block><span>jealousy with their graven images.
  </span><verse>59</verse><span>When God heard this, he was wroth, and
  greatly abhorred Israel.
  </span><verse>60</verse><span>So that he forsook
  the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;
  </span><verse>61</verse><span>and delivered his strength into captivity, and
  his glory into the enemy’s hand.
  </span><verse>62</verse><span>He gave his
  people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance,
  </span><verse>63</verse><span>the fire consumed their young men; and their
  maidens were not given to marriage.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>64</verse><span>Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.
  </span><verse>65</verse><span>Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that
  shouteth by reason of wine.
  </span><verse>66</verse><span>And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts; he put them to a
  perpetual reproach.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>67</verse><span>Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe
  of Ephraim;
  </span><verse>68</verse><span>but
  chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.
  </span><verse>69</verse><span>And he built his sanctuary like high palaces,
  like the earth which he hath established forever.
  </span><verse>70</verse><span>He chose David also his servant, and took him
  from the sheepfolds;
  </span><verse>71</verse><span>from following the ewes
  great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his
  inheritance.
  </span><verse>72</verse><span>So he fed them according to the
  integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.

  </span><verse>9</verse><span>Thou rulest the raging of the sea; when the waves thereof arise, thou

  </span><verse>13</verse><span>Thou hast a mighty arm; strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand.

  </span><verse>31</verse><span>if they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;
  </span><verse>32</verse><span>then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity
  with stripes.
  </span><verse>33</verse><span>Nevertheless my loving-kindness will I not
  utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.
  </span><verse>34</verse><span>My covenant will I not break, nor alter the
  thing that is gone out of my lips.
  </span><verse>35</verse><span>Once have I
  sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David.
  </span><verse>36</verse><span>His seed shall endure forever, and his throne

  </span><verse>7</verse><span>I watch and am as a sparrow alone upon the housetop.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>Mine enemies reproach me all the day; and they that are mad against me

  </span><verse>9</verse><span>For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping,

  </span><verse>9</verse><span>He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up; so he led them

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>They made a calf in Horeb, and worshiped the molten image.

  </span><verse>21</verse><span>They forgat God their savior, which had done great things in Egypt;
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red Sea.
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word;

  </span><verse>27</verse><span>to overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in

 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>28</verse><span>They joined themselves also unto Baal-Peor, and ate the sacrifices of

 <block>
  <verse>34</verse><span>They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded
  them;

  that hated them ruled over them.
  </span><verse>42</verse><span>Their enemies
  also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their
