  Adonijah sets himself up as king
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>1
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with
  clothes, but he gat no heat.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>Wherefore his servants said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin; and let her stand
   before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom,
   that my lord the king may get heat.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel,
  and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, and ministered to
  him; but the king knew her not.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, “I will be
  king;” and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run
  before him.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, “Why hast
  thou done so?” And he also was a very goodly man; and his mother bare
  him after Absalom.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the
  priest; and they following Adonijah helped him.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the
  prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which belonged to
  David, were not with Adonijah.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of
  Zoheleth, which is by En-Rogel, and called all his brethren the king’s
  sons, and all the men of Judah the king’s servants;
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>but Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon
  his brother, he called not.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bath-Sheba the mother of Solomon,
  saying:</span><quote><span>
   Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David
   our lord knoweth it not?
   </span><verse>12</verse><span>Now therefore come,
   let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own
   life, and the life of thy son Solomon.
   </span><verse>13</verse><span>Go and
   get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, “Didst not thou, my lord O
   king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying, ‘Assuredly Solomon thy son shall
   reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?’ Why then doth Adonijah
   reign?”
   </span><verse>14</verse><span>Behold, while thou yet talkest there
   with the king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And Bath-Sheba went in unto the king into the chamber; and the king was
  very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the king.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And Bath-Sheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the king
  said, “What wouldest thou?”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>And she said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   My lord, thou swarest by the LORD thy God unto thine handmaid, saying,
   “Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my
   throne.”
   </span><verse>18</verse><span>And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth;
   and now, my lord the king, thou knowest it not;
   </span><verse>19</verse><span>and he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and
   sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar
   the priest, and Joab the captain of the host; but Solomon thy servant hath
   he not called.
   </span><verse>20</verse><span>And thou, my lord, O king, the
   eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall
   sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.
   </span><verse>21</verse><span>Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord
   the king shall sleep with his father, that I and my son Solomon shall be
   counted offenders.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also
  came in.
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>And they told the king, saying, “Behold Nathan the prophet.” And when
  he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with
  his face to the ground.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>And Nathan said:</span><quote><span>
   My lord, O king, hast thou said, “Adonijah shall reign after me, and he
   shall sit upon my throne?”
   </span><verse>25</verse><span>For he is gone down
   this day, and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and
   hath called all the king’s sons, and the captains of the host, and
   Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say,
   God save king Adonijah.
   </span><verse>26</verse><span>But me, even me thy
   servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy
   servant Solomon, hath he not called.
   </span><verse>27</verse><span>Is this
   thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not showed it unto thy
   servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?
  </span></quote>

 <heading><span>
  David makes Solomon king
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>28</verse><span>Then king David answered and said, “Call me Bath-Sheba.” And she came
  into the king’s presence, and stood before the king.
  </span><verse>29</verse><span>And the king sware, and said:</span><quote><span>
   As the LORD liveth, that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress,
   </span><verse>30</verse><span>even as I sware unto thee by the LORD God of
   Israel, saying, “Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he
   shall sit upon my throne in my stead;” even so will I certainly do this
   day.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>31</verse><span>Then Bath-Sheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did reverence to
  the king, and said, “Let my lord king David live forever.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>32</verse><span>And king David said, “Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet,
  and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada.” And they came before the king.
  </span><verse>33</verse><span>The king also said unto them:</span><quote><span>
   Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride
   upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon;
   </span><verse>34</verse><span>and let Zadok the priest and Nathan the
   prophet anoint him there king over Israel; and blow ye with the trumpet,
   and say, God save king Solomon.
   </span><verse>35</verse><span>Then ye shall
   come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall
   be king in my stead; and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and
   over Judah.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>36</verse><span>And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said:</span><quote><span>
   Amen; the LORD God of my lord the king say so too.
   </span><verse>37</verse><span>As the LORD hath been with my lord the king,
   even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of
   my lord king David.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>38</verse><span>So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of
  Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused
  Solomon to ride upon king David’s mule, and brought him to Gihon.
  </span><verse>39</verse><span>And Zadok the priest took a horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and
  anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said,
  “God save king Solomon.”
  </span><verse>40</verse><span>And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes,
  and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of
  them.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>41</verse><span>And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had
  made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he
  said, “Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar?”
  </span><verse>42</verse><span>And while he yet spake, behold Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest
  came; and Adonijah said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   Come in; for thou art a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>43</verse><span>And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>
    Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king.
    </span><verse>44</verse><span>And the king hath sent with him Zadok the
    priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the
    Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the
    king’s mule;
    </span><verse>45</verse><span>and Zadok the
    priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon; and they
    are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is
    the noise that ye have heard.
    </span><verse>46</verse><span>And also Solomon
    sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.
    </span><verse>47</verse><span>And
    moreover the king’s servants came to bless our lord king David, saying,
    “God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne
    greater than thy throne.” And the king bowed himself upon the bed.
    </span><verse>48</verse><span>And also thus said the king, “Blessed be the
    LORD God of Israel, which hath given one to sit on my throne this day,
    mine eyes even seeing it.”
   </span></block>

  </quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>49</verse><span>And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up,
  and went every man his way.
  </span><verse>50</verse><span>And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught
  hold on the horns of the altar.
  </span><verse>51</verse><span>And it was told Solomon, saying:</span><quote><span>
   Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon; for, lo, he hath caught hold on the
   horns of the altar, saying, “Let king Solomon swear unto me today that he
   will not slay his servant with the sword.”
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>52</verse><span>And Solomon said:</span><quote><span>
   If he will show himself a worthy man, there shall not a hair of him fall
   to the earth; but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>53</verse><span>So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he
  came and bowed himself to king Solomon; and Solomon said unto him, “Go
  to thine house.”

  David’s instructions to Solomon
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>2
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged
  Solomon his son, saying:
  </span><quote>
   <block>
    <verse>2</verse><span>I go the way of all the earth; be thou strong therefore, and show
    thyself a man;
    </span><verse>3</verse><span>and
    keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his
    statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as
    it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that
    thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself;
    </span><verse>4</verse><span>that the LORD may continue his word which he
    spake concerning me, saying, “If thy children take heed to their way, to
    walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul,
    there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.”
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>5</verse><span>Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, and
    what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the
    son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the
    blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was
    about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down
    to the grave in peace.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>7</verse><span>But show kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let
    them be of those that eat at thy table; for so they came to me when I
    fled because of Absalom thy brother.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>8</verse><span>And, behold, thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of
    Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to
    Mahanaim; but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I sware to him by
    the LORD, saying, “I will not put thee to death with the sword.”
    </span><verse>9</verse><span>Now therefore hold him not guiltless; for thou art a wise man, and
    knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head bring thou
    down to the grave with blood.</span></block>

  </quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years; seven
  years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in
  Jerusalem.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  Solomon’s throne established
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom
  was established greatly.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bath-Sheba the mother of
  Solomon. And she said, “Comest thou peaceably?” And he said,
  “Peaceably.”
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>He said moreover, “I have somewhat to say unto thee.” And she said,
  “Say on.”
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>And he said:</span><quote><span>
   Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their
   faces on me, that I should reign; howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and
   is become my brother’s; for it was his from the LORD.
   </span><verse>16</verse><span>And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me
   not.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And she said unto him, “Say on.”
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And he said;
  </span><quote><span>
   Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he will not say thee nay)
   that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>And Bath-Sheba said, “Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.”
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>Bath-Sheba
  therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the
  king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his
  throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king’s mother; and she sat on
  his right hand.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>Then she said:
  </span><quote><span>
   I desire one small petition of thee; I pray thee, say me not nay.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And the king said unto her, “Ask on, my mother; for I will not say thee
  nay.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>And she said, “Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy
  brother to wife.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother:</span><quote><span>
   And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Ask for him the
   kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar
   the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying:</span><quote><span>
   God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word
   against his own life.
   </span><verse>24</verse><span>Now therefore, as the
   LORD liveth, which hath established me, and set me on the throne of David
   my father, and who hath made me a house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be
   put to death this day.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>25</verse><span>And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and
  he fell upon him that he died.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>26</verse><span>And unto Abiathar the priest said the king:</span><quote><span>
   Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death;
   but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark
   of the Lord GOD before David my father, and because thou hast been
   afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>27</verse><span>So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD; that he
  might fulfill the word of the LORD, which he spake concerning the house
  of Eli in Shiloh.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>28</verse><span>Then tidings came to Joab; for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though
  he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the
  LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.
  </span><verse>29</verse><span>And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the
  tabernacle
  of the LORD; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah
  the son of Jehoiada, saying, “Go, fall upon him.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>30</verse><span>And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto him:
  </span><quote><span>Thus
  saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here.</span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, “Thus said Joab, and thus
  he answered me.”
  </span><verse>31</verse><span>And the king said unto him:
  </span><quote><span>
   Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take
   away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of
   my father.
   </span><verse>32</verse><span>And the LORD shall return his blood
   upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than
   he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing thereof, to
   wit, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the
   son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.
   </span><verse>33</verse><span>Their blood shall therefore return upon the
   head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed forever; but upon David, and
   upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be
   peace forever from the LORD.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>34</verse><span>So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew
  him; and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.
  </span><verse>35</verse><span>And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host;
  and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>36</verse><span>And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   Build thee a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence
   any whither.
   </span><verse>37</verse><span>For it shall be, that on the day
   thou goest out, and passest over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for
   certain that thou shalt surely die; thy blood shall be upon thine own
   head.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>38</verse><span>And Shimei said unto the king:</span><quote><span>
   The saying is good; as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>39</verse><span>And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants
  of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And they
  told Shimei, saying, “Behold, thy servants be in Gath.”
  </span><verse>40</verse><span>And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to
  seek his servants; and Shimei went, and brought his servants from
  Gath.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>41</verse><span>And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath,
  and was come again.
  </span><verse>42</verse><span>And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto thee, saying,
   “Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any
   whither, that thou shalt surely die?” And thou saidst unto me, “The word
   that I have heard is good.”
   </span><verse>43</verse><span>Why then hast thou
   not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment that I have charged
   thee with?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>44</verse><span>The king said moreover to Shimei:</span><quote><span>
   Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to, that thou
   didst to David my father; therefore the LORD shall return thy wickedness
   upon thine own head;
   </span><verse>45</verse><span>and king Solomon shall be
   blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD
   forever.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>46</verse><span>So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went out, and
  fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand
  of Solomon.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>Solomon asks for wisdom
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>3
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And the LORD was not pleased with Solomon, for he made affinity with
  Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh’s daughter to wife, and brought
  her into the house of David until he had made an end of building his own
  house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.
  And the LORD blessed Solomon for the people’s sake only.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house
  built unto the name of the LORD, until those days.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>And because the LORD blessed Solomon as he was walking in the statutes
  of David, his father, he began to love the LORD, and he sacrificed and
  burnt incense in high places, and he called on the name of the LORD.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, for Gibeon was in a
  great high place; and Solomon offered upon that altar, in Gibeon, a
  thousand burnt offerings.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And the LORD hearkened unto Solomon, and appeared unto him in a dream
  by night, and said:</span><quote><span>
   Ask what I shall give thee.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And Solomon said:</span><quote><span>
   Thou hast showed unto thy servant David, my father, great things according
   to thy mercy when he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness,
   and in uprighteousness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this
   great kindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne this
   day.
   </span><verse>7</verse><span>And now, O Lord my God, thou hast made thy
   servant king, instead of David, my father, over thy people.
   </span><verse>8</verse><span>And I know not how to lead them, to go out, or
   come in before them, and I, thy servant, am as a little child, in the
   midst of thy people whom thou hast chosen, a great people that cannot be
   numbered, nor counted for multitude.
   </span><verse>9</verse><span>Give
   therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I
   may discern between good and bad; for who is able to judge this thy
   people, so great a people?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>And the speech pleased the LORD, that Solomon had asked this thing.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And God said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long
   life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of
   thine enemies; but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern
   judgment;
   </span><verse>12</verse><span>behold, I have done according to thy
   word; lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that
   there was none made king over Israel like unto thee before thee, neither

   </span><verse>13</verse><span>And
   I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches, and

   thou shalt not walk in unrighteousness, as did thy father David.

  <verse>16</verse><span>Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king, and stood

  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And the one woman said:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>
    O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a
    child with her in the house.
    </span><verse>18</verse><span>And it came to
    pass the third day after that I was delivered, that this woman was
    delivered also; and we were together; there was no stranger with us in the

    </span><verse>19</verse><span>And this
    woman’s child died in the night,
    because she overlaid it.
    </span><verse>20</verse><span>And she arose at
    midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thine handmaid slept, and
    laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom.
    </span><verse>21</verse><span>And when I rose in the morning to give my
    child suck, behold, it was dead; but when I had considered it in the

  <verse>22</verse><span>And the other woman said, “Nay; but the living is my son, and the dead

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>Then said the king, “The one saith, ‘This is my son that liveth, and

  </span><verse>24</verse><span>And the king said, “Bring me a sword.” And they brought a sword before

  <verse>26</verse><span>Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king, for her

  neither mine nor thine, but divide it.”
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>Then the king answered and said, “Give her the living child, and in no

  <verse>1</verse><span>So king Solomon was king over all Israel.

  priest,
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son

  made provision.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>And these are their names: The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim;

  </span><verse>21</verse><span>And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of
  the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt, they brought presents,

  Preparations for building the temple

 <chapter>5
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard
  that they had anointed him king in the room of his father; for Hiram was
  ever a lover of David.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying:
  </span><quote>
   <block>
    <verse>3</verse><span>Thou knowest how that David my father could not build a house unto the
    name of the LORD his God, for the wars which were about him on every
    side, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet.
    </span><verse>4</verse><span>But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side, so that there
    is neither adversary nor evil occurrent.
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>And, behold, I purpose to build a house unto the name of the LORD my
    God, as the LORD spake unto David my father, saying, “Thy son, whom I
    will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build a house unto my
    name.”</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>6</verse><span>Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon;
    and my servants shall be with thy servants; and unto thee will I give
    hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint; for thou
    knowest that there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like
    unto the Sidonians.</span></block>

  </quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he
  rejoiced greatly, and said, “Blessed be the LORD this day, which hath
  given unto David a wise son over this great people.”
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying:</span><quote><span>
   I have considered the things which thou sentest to me for; and I will do
   all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.
   </span><verse>9</verse><span>My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon
   unto the sea; and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that
   thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and
   thou shalt receive them; and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving
   food for my household.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all his
  desire.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And
  Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his
  household, and
  twenty measures of pure oil; thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he
  promised him; and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two
  made a league together.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was
  thirty thousand men.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses; a month
  they were in Lebanon, and two months at home; and Adoniram was over the
  levy.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and
  fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains;
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>besides the chief of Solomon’s officers which were over the work, three
  thousand and three hundred, which ruled over the people that wrought in
  the work.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones,
  and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house.

  stone-squarers; so they prepared timber and stones to build the

  Solomon builds the temple
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>6
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the
  children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth
  year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month of Zif, which is the
  second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length thereof
  was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, the height
  thereof thirty cubits.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the
  length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits
  was the breadth thereof before the house.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about,
  against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of
  the oracle; and he made chambers round about.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was six
  cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad; for without in the
  wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams
  should not be fastened in the walls of the house.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready
  before it was brought thither; so that there was neither hammer nor axe
  nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house; and
  they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber, and out of the
  middle into the third.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with
  beams and boards of cedar.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high; and
  they rested on the house with timber of cedar.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying:</span><quote>
   <verse>12</verse><span>Concerning this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in
   my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to
   walk in them; then will I perform my word with thee which I spake unto
   David thy father;
   </span><verse>13</verse><span>and I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my
   people Israel.</span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>So Solomon built the house, and finished it.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both
  the floor of the house, and the walls of the ceiling; and he covered
  them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house with
  planks of fir.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor
  and the walls with boards of cedar; he even built them for it within,
  even for the oracle, even for the most holy place.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits long.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open
  flowers; all was cedar; there was no stone seen.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And the oracle he prepared
  in the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And the oracle in the forepart was twenty
  cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the
  height thereof; and he overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the
  altar which was of cedar.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>So Solomon overlaid
  the house within with pure gold; and he made a partition by the chains of
  gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>And the whole house he overlaid with gold,
  until he had finished all the house; also the whole altar that was by the
  oracle he overlaid with gold.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>And within the oracle he made two cherubim of olive tree, each ten
  cubits high.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing
  of the cherub; from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost
  part of the other were ten cubits.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>And the
  other cherub was ten cubits; both the cherubim were of one measure and one
  size.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>The height of one cherub was ten cubits,
  and so was it of the other cherub.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>27</verse><span>And he set the cherubim within the inner house; and they stretched
  forth the wings of the cherubim, so that the wing of the one touched the
  one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and
  their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>And he overlaid the cherubim with gold.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>29</verse><span>And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved
  figures of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, within and without.
  </span><verse>30</verse><span>And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and
  without.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>31</verse><span>And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree; the
  lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.
  </span><verse>32</verse><span>The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings
  of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with
  gold, and spread gold upon the cherubim, and upon the palm trees.
  </span><verse>33</verse><span>So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree, a
  fourth part of the wall.
  </span><verse>34</verse><span>And the two doors were of fir tree; the two leaves of the one door were
  folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.
  </span><verse>35</verse><span>And he carved thereon cherubim and palm trees and open flowers; and
  covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work.
  </span><verse>36</verse><span>And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a row
  of cedar beams.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>37</verse><span>In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid, in
  the month Zif;
  </span><verse>38</verse><span>and in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month,
  was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according
  to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it.

 <chapter>7
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house.</span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof
  was a hundred cubits,
  and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty
  cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the
  pillars.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And it was covered with cedar above
  upon the beams, that lay on forty-five pillars, fifteen in a row.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And there were windows in three rows, and light
  was against light in three ranks.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And all the
  doors and posts were square, with the windows; and light was against light
  in three ranks.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty cubits,
  and the breadth thereof thirty cubits; and the porch was before them;
  and the other pillars and the thick beam were before them.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even the
  porch of judgment; and it was covered with cedar from one side of the
  floor to the other.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>And his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch, which
  was of the like work. Solomon made also a house for Pharaoh’s daughter,
  whom he had taken to wife, like unto his porch.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>All these were of costly stones, according to the measure of hewed
  stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation
  unto the coping, and so on the outside toward the great court.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of
  ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And above were costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones, and
  cedars.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And the great court round about was with three rows of hewed stones,
  and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the
  LORD, and for the porch of the house.

  The temple furnishings
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>He was a widow’s son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man
  of Tyre, a worker in brass; and he was filled with wisdom, and
  understanding, and cunning to work all works in brass. And he came to
  king Solomon, and wrought all his work.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>For he cast two pillars of brass of eighteen cubits high apiece; and a
  line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And he made two chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the
  pillars; the height of the one chapiter was five cubits, and the height
  of the other chapiter was five cubits;
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>and nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the chapiters
  which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one chapiter, and
  seven for the other chapiter.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one network,
  to cover the chapiters that were upon the top, with pomegranates; and so
  did he for the other chapiter.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily
  work in the porch, four cubits.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above,
  over against the belly which was by the network; and the pomegranates
  were two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple; and he set up the
  right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin; and he set up the left
  pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>And upon the top of the pillars was lily work; so was the work of the
  pillars finished.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other; it
  was round all about, and his height was five cubits; and a line of
  thirty cubits did compass it round about.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>And under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing it,
  ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about; the knops were cast in
  two rows, when it was cast.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three
  looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three
  looking toward the east; and the sea was set above upon them, and all
  their hinder parts were inward.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>And it was a handbreath thick, and the brim thereof was wrought like
  the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies; it contained two thousand
  baths.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>27</verse><span>And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base,
  and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it.
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>And the work of the bases was on this manner; they had borders, and the
  borders were between the ledges;
  </span><verse>29</verse><span>and on the borders that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and
  cherubim; and upon the ledges there was a base above; and beneath the
  lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work.
  </span><verse>30</verse><span>And every base had four brazen wheels, and plates of brass; and the
  four corners thereof had under-setters; under the laver were
  under-setters molten, at the side of every addition.
  </span><verse>31</verse><span>And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit; but the
  mouth thereof was round after the work of the base, a cubit and a half;
  and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with their borders,
  foursquare, not round.
  </span><verse>32</verse><span>And under the borders
  were four wheels; and the axletrees of the wheels were joined to the base;
  and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit.
  </span><verse>33</verse><span>And the work of the wheels was like the work
  of a chariot wheel; their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes,
  and their spokes, were all molten.
  </span><verse>34</verse><span>And there
  were four under-setters to the four corners of one base; and the
  undersetters were of the very base itself.
  </span><verse>35</verse><span>And
  in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high; and
  on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the border thereof were of

  </span><verse>36</verse><span>For on the plates of the ledges
  thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved cherubim, lions, and palm
  trees, according to the proportion of every one, and additions round
  about.
  </span><verse>37</verse><span>After this manner he made the ten
  bases; all of them had one casting, one measure, and one size.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>38</verse><span>Then made he ten lavers of brass; one laver contained forty baths; and
  every laver was four cubits; and upon every one of the ten bases one
  laver.
  </span><verse>39</verse><span>And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the
  left side of the house; and he set the sea on the right side of the
  house eastward, over against the south.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>40</verse><span>And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram
  made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the
  house of the LORD.
  </span><verse>41</verse><span>The two pillars, and the two bowls of the chapiters that were on the
  top of the two pillars; and the two networks, to cover the two bowls of
  the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars;
  </span><verse>42</verse><span>and four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, even two rows of
  pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters
  that were upon the pillars;
  </span><verse>43</verse><span>and the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases;
  </span><verse>44</verse><span>and one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;
  </span><verse>45</verse><span>and the pots, and the shovels, and the basins; and all these vessels,
  which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the LORD, were of
  bright brass.
  </span><verse>46</verse><span>In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground
  between Succoth and Zarthan.
  </span><verse>47</verse><span>And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding
  many; neither was the weight of the brass found out.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>48</verse><span>And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the
  LORD; the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the showbread
  was.
  </span><verse>49</verse><span>And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side, and five on
  the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the
  tongs of gold.
  </span><verse>50</verse><span>And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and
  the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of
  the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, to
  wit, of the temple.

 <block>
  <verse>51</verse><span>So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the

  Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the covenant
  of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the
  feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of the
  congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, even
  those did the priests and the Levites bring up.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were
  assembled unto him, where with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and
  oxen that could not be told nor numbered for multitude.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his
  place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under
  the wings of the cherubim.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>For the cherubim spread forth their two
  wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the
  staves thereof above.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>And they drew out the
  staves, that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before
  the oracle, and they were not seen without; and there they are unto this
  day.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>There was nothing in the ark save the two
  tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a
  covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of
  Egypt.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And it came to pass, when the priests
  were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the
  LORD.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>So that the priests could not stand to
  minister because of the cloud; for the glory of the LORD had filled the

  <verse>14</verse><span>Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in
  one year was
  </span><superscript><span>b</span></superscript>
  <note>
   <superscript><span>b</span></superscript><span>25 tons or 23 metric tons</span></note><span>six hundred threescore and six
   talents of gold.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>Besides that he had of the
  merchantmen, and of the traffic of the spice merchants, and of all the
  kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And king Solomon made two hundred targets of
  beaten gold;
  </span><superscript><span>c</span></superscript>
  <note>
   <superscript><span>c</span></superscript><span>15 lb or 6.9 kg</span></note><span>six hundred shekels of gold went
   to one target.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And he made three hundred
  shields of beaten gold; three pounds of gold went to one shield; and the
  king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>Moreover, the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with
  the best gold.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round behind;
  and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat, and two
  lions stood beside the stays.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the
  six steps; there was not the like made in any kingdom.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>And all king Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the
  vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none
  were of silver;
  it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish
  with the navy of Hiram; once in three years came the navy of Tharshish,
  bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for
  wisdom.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had
  put in his heart.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels
  of gold, and garments, and armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate
  year by year.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>26</verse><span>And Solomon gathered together chariots and
  horsemen; and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve
  thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with
  the king at Jerusalem.
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>And the king made
  silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the
  sycamore trees that are in the vale, for abundance.
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt,
  and linen yarn; the king’s merchants received the linen yarn at a price.
  </span><verse>29</verse><span>And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt
  for
  </span><superscript><span>a</span></superscript>
  <note>
   <superscript><span>a</span></superscript><span>15 lb or 6.9 kg</span></note><span>six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse

  Solomon’s wives
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>11
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the daughter
  of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and
  Hittites;
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>of the nations concerning which the LORD said unto the children of
  Israel, “Ye shall not go in to them, neither shall they come in unto
  you; for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods;”
  Solomon clave unto these in love.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred
  concubines; and his wives turned away his heart.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, his wives turned away his
  heart after other gods; and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his
  God, and it became as the heart of David his father.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and
  after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not fully after
  the LORD, as did David his father.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination of
  Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the
  abomination of the children of Ammon.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt incense and
  sacrificed unto their gods.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned from
  the LORD God of Israel, which had appeared unto him twice,
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go
  after other gods; but he kept not that which the LORD commanded.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon:</span><quote><span>
   Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and
   my statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom
   from thee, and will give it to thy servant.
   </span><verse>12</verse><span>Notwithstanding, in thy days I will not do it
   for David thy father’s sake; but I will rend it out of the hand of thy
   son.
   </span><verse>13</verse><span>Howbeit I will not rend away all the
   kingdom; but will give one tribe to thy son for David my servant’s sake,
   and for Jerusalem’s sake which I have chosen.

  Solomon’s adversaries
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>And the LORD stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite;
  he was of the king’s seed in Edom.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of
  the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male
  in Edom;
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>(for six months did Joab remain there with all Israel, until he had cut
  off every male in Edom)
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>that Hadad fled, he and certain
  Edomites of his father’s servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad being
  yet a little child.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>And they arose out of
  Midian, and came to Paran; and they took men with them out of Paran, and
  they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh king of Egypt; which gave him a house,
  and appointed him victuals, and gave him land.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>And Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave
  him to wife, the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the
  queen.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes
  weaned in Pharaoh’s house; and Genubath was in Pharaoh’s household among
  the sons of Pharaoh.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and
  that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, “Let
  me depart, that I may go to mine own country.”
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>Then Pharaoh said unto him, “But what hast thou lacked with me, that,
  behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country?” And he answered,
  “Nothing; howbeit let me go in any wise.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah,
  which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah;
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>and he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band, when
  David slew them of Zobah; and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein,
  and reigned in Damascus.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, besides the
  mischief that Hadad did; and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over
  Syria.

  Jeroboam rebels against Solomon
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>26</verse><span>And Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon’s
  servant, whose mother’s name was Zeruah, a widow woman, even he lifted
  up his hand against the king.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>27</verse><span>And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king;
  Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the city of David his
  father.
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor; and Solomon seeing the
  young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all the charge
  of the house of Joseph.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>29</verse><span>And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem,
  that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; and he had
  clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field;
  </span><verse>30</verse><span>and Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him, and rent it in
  twelve pieces;
  </span><verse>31</verse><span>and he said to Jeroboam:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>
    Take thee ten pieces; for thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: Behold,
    I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten
    tribes to thee;
    </span><verse>32</verse><span>(but he shall have one tribe
    for my servant David’s sake, and for Jerusalem’s sake, the city which I
    have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel)
    </span><verse>33</verse><span>because that they have forsaken me, and have
    worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the
    Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and have not walked
    in my ways, to do that which is right in mine eyes, and my statutes, and
    my judgments, and his heart is become as David his father; and he
    repenteth not as did David his father, that I may forgive him.
    </span><verse>34</verse><span>Howbeit, I will not take the whole kingdom out
    of his hand, but I will make him prince all the days of his life, for
    David my servant’s sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and
    my statutes in that day.
    </span><verse>35</verse><span>But I will take the
    kingdom out of his sons’s hand, and will give unto thee ten tribes. And
    unto his son will I give one tribe.
    </span><verse>36</verse><span>That David
    my servant may have a light always before me in Jerusalem, the city which
    I have chosen me to put my name there.
    </span><verse>37</verse><span>And I
    will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul
    desireth, and shall be king over Israel.
    </span><verse>38</verse><span>And
    it shall be, if thou wilt hearken
    unto all that I command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do right in
    my sight, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant
    did in the day that I blessed him; I will be with thee, and build thee a
    sure house as I built for David, and gave Israel unto thee.
    </span><verse>39</verse><span>And for the transgression of David, and also
    for the people, I have rent the kingdom, and for this I will afflict the
    seed of David, but not forever.

  </span><verse>42</verse><span>And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was
  forty years.
  </span><verse>43</verse><span>And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And Rehoboam went to Shechem; for all Israel were come to Shechem to

  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet in
  Egypt, heard it, (for he was fled from the presence of king Solomon, and
  Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt)
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>that they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all the congregation of
  Israel came, and spake unto Rehoboam, saying:</span><quote>
   <verse>4</verse><span>Thy father made our yoke grievous; now therefore make thou the grievous
   service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter,
   and we will serve thee.</span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>And he said unto them, “Depart yet for three days, then come again to
  me.” And the people departed.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before Solomon
  his father while he yet lived, and said:</span><quote><span>
   How do ye advise that I may answer this people?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>And they spake unto him, saying:</span><quote><span>
   If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them,
   and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy
   servants forever.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him,
  and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, and which
  stood before him;
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>and he said unto them:</span><quote><span>
   What counsel give ye that we may answer this people, who have spoken to
   me, saying, “Make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter”?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him,
  saying:</span><quote><span>
   Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, “Thy
   father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us;” thus shalt
   thou say unto them, “My little finger shall be thicker than my father’s
   loins.
   </span><verse>11</verse><span>And now whereas my father did lade you
   with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke; my father hath chastised you
   with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.”
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the
  king had appointed, saying, “Come to me again the third day.”
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old men’s
  counsel that they gave him;
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>and spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying:</span><quote><span>
   My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke; my father
   also chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause was
  from the LORD, that he might perform his saying, which the LORD spake by
  Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto
  them, the people answered the king, saying, “What portion have we in
  David? Neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse; to your tents, O
  Israel; now see to thine own house, David.” So Israel departed into their
  tents.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>But as for the children of Israel which
  dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.

  <verse>18</verse><span>Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and all
  Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king Rehoboam

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of
  Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and fourscore thousand

  to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.

  <verse>22</verse><span>But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying:</span><quote>
   <verse>23</verse><span>Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all
   the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people,
   saying,

  <verse>25</verse><span>Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and

 <block>
  <verse>31</verse><span>And he made a house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of

  the altar. So did he in Beth-El, sacrificing unto the calves that he had
  made; and he placed in Beth-El the priests of the high places which he
  had made.
  </span><verse>33</verse><span>So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Beth-El the fifteenth

    Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took a hundred

    </span><verse>5</verse><span>And Ahab said unto Obadiah:
    </span><quote><span>
     Go into the land, unto all fountains of water, and unto all brooks;

    <verse>29</verse><span>So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to
    Ramoth-Gilead.

    <verse>31</verse><span>But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had
    rule over his chariots, saying, “Fight neither with small nor great,
    save only with the king of Israel.”
    </span><verse>32</verse><span>And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat,
    that they said, “Surely it is the king of Israel.” And they turned aside
    to fight against him; and Jehoshaphat cried out.
    </span><verse>33</verse><span>And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that
    it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing
    him.

    <verse>34</verse><span>And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel
    between the joints of the harness; wherefore he said unto the driver of
    his chariot, “Turn thine hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am
    wounded.”
    </span><verse>35</verse><span>And the battle increased that day; and the king was stayed up in his
    chariot against the Syrians, and died at even; and the blood ran out of
    the wound into the midst of the chariot.
    </span><verse>36</verse><span>And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down
    of the sun, saying, “Every man to his city, and every man to his own
    country.”
