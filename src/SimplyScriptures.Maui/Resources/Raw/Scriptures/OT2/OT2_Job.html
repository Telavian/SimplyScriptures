    Job’s character and wealth

   <chapter>1

   <block>
    <verse>1</verse><span>There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job, and that man was
    perfect and upright and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.
    </span><verse>2</verse><span>And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.
    </span><verse>3</verse><span>His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three
    thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she
    asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of
    all the men of the east.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>4</verse><span>And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and
    sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that
    Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the
    morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all;
    for Job said, “It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their
    hearts.” Thus did Job continually.

    Satan allowed to test Job
   </span></heading>

   <block>
    <verse>6</verse><span>Now there was a day when the children of God came to present themselves
    before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.
    </span><verse>7</verse><span>And the LORD said unto Satan:</span><quote><span>
     Whence comest thou?
    </span></quote>
   </block>

   <block><span>
    Then Satan answered the LORD, and said:
    </span><quote><span>
     From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.
    </span></quote>
   </block>

   <block>
    <verse>8</verse><span>And the LORD said unto Satan:
    </span><quote><span>
     Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the
     earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth
     evil?
    </span></quote>
   </block>

   <block>
    <verse>9</verse><span>Then Satan answered the LORD, and said:</span><quote><span>
     Doth Job fear God for naught?
     </span><verse>10</verse><span>Hast not thou
     made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on
     every side? Thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is
     increased in the land.
     </span><verse>11</verse><span>But put forth thine
     hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.
    </span></quote>
   </block>

   <block>
    <verse>12</verse><span>And the LORD said unto Satan:</span><quote><span>
     Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth
     thine hand.
    </span></quote>
   </block>

   <block><span>
    So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.

   </span></heading>

   <block>
    <verse>13</verse><span>And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and
    drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house;
    </span><verse>14</verse><span>and there came a messenger unto Job, and said:</span><quote><span>
     The oxen were ploughing, and the asses feeding beside them;
     </span><verse>15</verse><span>and the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them
     away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I
     only am escaped alone to tell thee.
    </span></quote>
   </block>

   <block>
    <verse>16</verse><span>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said:</span><quote><span>
     The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and
     the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
    </span></quote>
   </block>

   <block>
    <verse>17</verse><span>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said:</span><quote><span>
     The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have
     carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword;
     and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
    </span></quote>
   </block>

   <block>
    <verse>18</verse><span>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said:</span><quote><span>
     Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in there eldest
     brother’s house;
     </span><verse>19</verse><span>and behold, there came a
     great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house,
     and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped
     alone to tell thee.
    </span></quote>
   </block>

   <block>
    <verse>20</verse><span>Then Job arose and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down
    upon the ground and worshiped,
    </span><verse>21</verse><span>and said:</span><quote><span>
     Naked came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return thither;
     the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the
     LORD.

    <verse>22</verse><span>In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.

    <verse>1</verse><span>Again there was a day when the children of God came to present
    themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present
    himself before the LORD.
    </span><verse>2</verse><span>And the LORD said unto Satan:
    </span><quote><span>
     From whence comest thou?
    </span></quote>
   </block>

   <block><span>
    And Satan answered the LORD, and said:
    </span><quote><span>
     From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.
    </span></quote>
   </block>

   <block>
    <verse>3</verse><span>And the LORD said unto Satan:</span><quote><span>
     Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the
     earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God and escheweth
     evil? And still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me
     against him, to destroy him without cause.
    </span></quote>
   </block>

   <block>
    <verse>4</verse><span>And Satan answered the LORD, and said:</span><quote><span>
     Skin for skin, yea, all that man hath will he give for his life.
     </span><verse>5</verse><span>But put forth thine hand now, and touch his
     bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.
    </span></quote>

   <block>
    <verse>6</verse><span>And the LORD said unto Satan:</span><quote><span>
     Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life.
    </span></quote>
   </block>

   <block>
    <verse>7</verse><span>So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with
    sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down
    among the ashes.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>9</verse><span>Then said his wife unto him:</span><quote><span>
     Dost thou still retain thine integrity? Curse God, and die.
    </span></quote>
   </block>

   <block>
    <verse>10</verse><span>But he said unto her:</span><quote><span>
     Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? Shall we receive
     good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?
    </span></quote>
   </block>

   <block><span>
    In all this did not Job sin with his lips.

    Job’s three friends
   </span></heading>

   <block>
    <verse>11</verse><span>Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon
    him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and
    Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite; for they had made an
    appointment together to come to mourn with him, and to comfort him.
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they
    lifted up their voice and wept; and they rent everyone his mantle, and
    sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.
    </span><verse>13</verse><span>So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights,
    and none spake a word unto him; for they saw that his grief was very
    great.

    <verse>1</verse><span>After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.
    </span><verse>2</verse><span>And Job spake, and said:
    </span><quote>
     <block>
      <verse>3</verse><span>Let the day perish wherein I was born,</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>and the night in which it was said, “There is a man-child conceived.”</span></indent>
      <verse>4</verse><span>Let that day be darkness;</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.</span></indent>
      <verse>5</verse><span>Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it;</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.</span></indent>
      <verse>6</verse><span>As for that night, let darkness seize upon it;</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>let it not be joined unto the days of the year;</span></indent>
      <indent><span>let it not come into the number of the months.</span></indent>
      <verse>7</verse><span>Lo, let that night be solitary;</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>let no joyful voice come therein.</span></indent>
      <verse>8</verse><span>Let them curse it that curse the day,</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>who are ready to raise up their mourning.</span></indent>
      <verse>9</verse><span>Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark;</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>let it look for light, but have none;</span></indent>
      <indent><span>neither let it see the dawning of the day;</span></indent>
      <verse>10</verse><span>because it shut not up the doors of my mother’s womb,</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.</span></indent>
     </block>

     <block>
      <verse>11</verse><span>Why died I not from the womb?</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>Why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?</span></indent>
      <verse>12</verse><span>Why did the knees prevent me?</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>Or why the breasts that I should suck?</span></indent>
      <verse>13</verse><span>For now should I have lain still and been quiet,
      </span><break></break>
      <indent><span>I should have slept; then had I been at rest,</span></indent>
      <verse>14</verse><span>With kings and counselors of the earth,
      </span><break></break>
      <indent><span>which built desolate places for themselves;</span></indent>
      <verse>15</verse><span>Or with princes that had gold,</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>who filled their houses with silver;</span></indent>
      <verse>16</verse><span>Or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been;</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>as infants which never saw light.</span></indent>
     </block>

     <block>
      <verse>17</verse><span>There the wicked cease from troubling;</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>and there the weary be at rest.</span></indent>
      <verse>18</verse><span>There the prisoners rest together;</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>they hear not the voice of the oppressor.</span></indent>
      <verse>19</verse><span>The small and great are there;
      </span><indent><span>and the servant is free from his master.</span></indent>
     </block>

     <block>
      <verse>20</verse><span>Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery,</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>and life unto the bitter in soul;</span></indent>
      <verse>21</verse><span>Which long for death, but it cometh not;</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>and dig for it more than for
      hid treasures;</span></indent>
      <verse>22</verse><span>Which rejoice exceedingly,</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>and are glad when they can find the grave?</span></indent>
      <verse>23</verse><span>Why is light given to a man whose way is hid,</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>and whom God hath hedged in?</span></indent>
      <verse>24</verse><span>For my sighing cometh before I eat,</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>and my roarings are poured out like the waters</span></indent>
      <verse>25</verse><span>For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me,</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>and that which I
      was afraid of is come unto me.</span></indent>
      <verse>26</verse><span>I was not in safety, neither had I rest,</span><break></break>

      <indent><span>and sow wickedness and reap the same.</span></indent>
      <verse>9</verse><span>By the blast of God they perish,</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.</span></indent>
      <verse>10</verse><span>The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion,</span><break></break>

     <block>
      <verse>12</verse><span>Now a thing was secretly brought to me,</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>and mine ear received a little thereof.</span></indent>
      <verse>13</verse><span>In thoughts from the visions of the night,</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>when deep sleep falleth on men,</span></indent>
      <verse>14</verse><span>Fear came upon me, and trembling,</span><break></break>

      <indent><span>an image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,</span></indent>
      <verse>17</verse><span>“Shall mortal man be more just than God?</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>Shall a man be more pure than his Maker?”</span></indent>
      <verse>18</verse><span>Behold, he put no trust in his servants;</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>and his angels he charged with folly;</span></indent>
      <verse>19</verse><span>How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay,</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth?</span></indent>
      <verse>20</verse><span>They are destroyed from morning to evening;</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>they perish forever without any regarding it.</span></indent>
      <verse>21</verse><span>Doth not their excellency which is in them go away?</span><break></break>

    <verse>1</verse><span>Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said:</span><quote>
     <block>
      <verse>2</verse><span>Should not the multitude of words be answered?</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>And should a man full of talk be justified?</span></indent>
      <verse>3</verse><span>Should thy lies make men hold their peace?</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>And when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?</span></indent>
      <verse>4</verse><span>For thou hast said, “My doctrine is pure,</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>and I am clean in thine eyes.”</span></indent>
      <verse>5</verse><span>But oh that God would speak,</span><break></break>

      <verse>6</verse><span>and that he would show thee the secrets of wisdom,</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>that they are double to that which is!</span></indent><span>
      Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth.</span><break></break>

      <verse>10</verse><span>If he cut off, and shut up,</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>or gather together, then who can hinder him?</span></indent>
      <verse>11</verse><span>For he knoweth vain men;</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>he seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider it?</span></indent>
      <verse>12</verse><span>For vain man would be wise,</span><break></break>

      <verse>13</verse><span>If thou prepare thine heart,</span><break></break>

      <verse>14</verse><span>If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away,</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.</span></indent>
      <verse>15</verse><span>For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot;</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:</span></indent>
      <verse>16</verse><span>Because thou shalt forget thy misery,</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>and remember it as waters that pass away:</span></indent>
      <verse>17</verse><span>And thine age shall be clearer than the noonday;</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning.</span></indent>
      <verse>18</verse><span>And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope;</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>yea, thou shalt dig about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest in safety.</span></indent>
      <verse>19</verse><span>Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid;</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>yea, many shall make suit unto thee.</span></indent>
      <verse>20</verse><span>But the eyes of the wicked shall fail,</span><break></break>

       <verse>4</verse><span>I also could speak as ye do; if your soul were in my soul’s stead,</span><break></break>

       <verse>11</verse><span>God hath delivered me to the ungodly,</span><break></break>

      <verse>2</verse><span>Hear diligently my speech,</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>and let this be your consolations.</span></indent>
      <verse>3</verse><span>Suffer me that I may speak;</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>and after that I have spoken, mock on.</span></indent>
      <verse>4</verse><span>As for me, is my complaint to man?</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>And if it were so, why should not my spirit be troubled?</span></indent>
      <verse>5</verse><span>Mark me, and be astonished,</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>and lay your hand upon your mouth.</span></indent>
      <verse>6</verse><span>Even when I remember I am afraid,</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>and trembling taketh hold on my flesh.</span></indent>
      <verse>7</verse><span>Wherefore do the wicked live,</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>become old, yea, are mighty in power?</span></indent>
      <verse>8</verse><span>Their seed is established in their sight with them,</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>and their offspring before their eyes.</span></indent>
      <verse>9</verse><span>Their houses are safe from fear,</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>neither is the rod of God upon them.</span></indent>
      <verse>10</verse><span>Their bull gendereth, and faileth not;</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.</span></indent>
      <verse>11</verse><span>They send forth their little ones like a flock,</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>and their children dance.</span></indent>
      <verse>12</verse><span>They take the timbrel and harp,</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>and rejoice at the sound of the organ.</span></indent>
      <verse>13</verse><span>They spend their days in wealth,</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>and in a moment go down to the grave.</span></indent>
      <verse>14</verse><span>Therefore they say unto God, “Depart from us;</span><break></break>

      <verse>15</verse><span>What is the Almighty, that we should serve him;</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?”</span></indent>
      <verse>16</verse><span>Lo, their good is not in their hand;</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>the counsel of the wicked is far from me.</span></indent>

      <verse>17</verse><span>How oft is the candle of the wicked put out!</span><break></break>

      <indent><span>God distributeth sorrows in his anger.</span></indent>
      <verse>18</verse><span>They are as stubble before the wind,</span><break></break>

      <verse>2</verse><span>As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment;</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>and the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul;</span></indent>
      <verse>3</verse><span>All the while my breath is in me,</span><break></break>

      <indent><span>till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me.</span></indent>
      <verse>6</verse><span>My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go;</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.</span></indent>
      <verse>7</verse><span>Let mine enemy be as the wicked,</span><break></break>

      <verse>11</verse><span>I will teach you by the hand of God;</span><break></break>
      <indent><span>that which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.</span></indent>

  <verse>1</verse><span>So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in
  his own eyes.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>Then
  was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the
  kindred of Ram; against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified
  himself rather than God.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>Also against his three
  friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer; and yet
  had condemned Job.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>Now Elihu had waited till
  Job had spoken, because they were elder than he.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the
  mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite
  answered and said:

    I am young,</span><break></break>

    <verse>9</verse><span>Great men are not always wise;</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>neither do the aged understand judgment.</span></indent>

    <indent><span>but stood still, and answered no more)</span></indent>
    <verse>17</verse><span>I said, I will answer also my part;</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>I also will show mine opinion.</span></indent>
    <verse>18</verse><span>For I am full of matter;</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>the spirit within me constraineth me.</span></indent>

  <verse>1</verse><span>Furthermore Elihu answered and said:
  </span><quote>
   <block>
    <verse>2</verse><span>Hear my words, O ye wise men;</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.</span></indent>
    <verse>3</verse><span>For the ear trieth words,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>as the mouth tasteth meat.</span></indent>
    <verse>4</verse><span>Let us choose to us judgment;</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>let us know among ourselves what is good.</span></indent>
    <verse>5</verse><span>For Job hath said, “I am righteous;</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and God hath taken away my judgment.</span></indent>
    <verse>6</verse><span>Should I lie against my right?</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>My wound is incurable without transgression.”</span></indent>
    <verse>7</verse><span>What man is like Job,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>who drinketh up scorning like water?</span></indent>
    <verse>8</verse><span>Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and walketh with wicked men.</span></indent>
    <verse>9</verse><span>For he hath said, “It profiteth a man nothing</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>that he should delight himself with God.”</span></indent>
   </block>

   <block>
    <verse>10</verse><span>Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding;</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>far be it from God, that he should do wickedness;</span></indent>
    <indent><span>and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.</span></indent>
    <verse>11</verse><span>For the work of a man shall he render unto him,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and cause every man to find according to his ways.</span></indent>
    <verse>12</verse><span>Yea, surely God will not do wickedly,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.</span></indent>
    <verse>13</verse><span>Who hath given him a charge over the earth?</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>Or who hath disposed the whole world?</span></indent>
    <verse>14</verse><span>If he set his heart upon man,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;</span></indent>
    <verse>15</verse><span>All flesh shall perish together,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and man shall turn again unto dust.</span></indent>

    <indent><span>hearken to the voice of my words.</span></indent>
    <verse>17</verse><span>Shall even he that hateth right govern?</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>And wilt thou condemn him that is most just?</span></indent>
    <verse>18</verse><span>Is it fit to say to a king, “Thou art wicked”?</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>And to princes, “Ye are ungodly”?</span></indent>
    <verse>19</verse><span>How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>nor regardeth the rich more than the poor?</span></indent>
    <indent><span>For they all are the work of his hands.</span></indent>
    <verse>20</verse><span>In a moment shall they die,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away;</span></indent>
    <indent><span>and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.</span></indent>
   </block>

   <block>
    <verse>21</verse><span>For his eyes are upon the ways of man,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and he seeth all his goings.</span></indent>
    <verse>22</verse><span>There is no darkness, nor shadow of death,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</span></indent>
    <verse>23</verse><span>For he will not lay upon man more than right;</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>that he should enter into judgment with God.</span></indent>
    <verse>24</verse><span>He shall break in pieces mighty men without number,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and set others in their stead.</span></indent>
    <verse>25</verse><span>Therefore he knoweth their works,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.</span></indent>
    <verse>26</verse><span>He striketh them as wicked men</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>in the open sight of others;</span></indent>
    <verse>27</verse><span>Because they turned back from him,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and would not consider any of his ways;</span></indent>
    <verse>28</verse><span>So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.</span></indent>
    <verse>29</verse><span>When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble?</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>And when he hideth his face, who then can behold him?</span></indent>
    <indent><span>Whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only;</span></indent>

    <verse>16</verse><span>One is so near to another,</span><break></break>

  <verse>1</verse><span>Then Job answered the LORD, and said:
  </span><quote>
   <block>
    <verse>2</verse><span>I know that thou canst do everything,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and that no thought can be withholden from thee.</span></indent>
    <verse>3</verse><span>Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge?</span><break></break><span>
    Therefore have I uttered that I understood not;</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.</span></indent>
    <verse>4</verse><span>Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak;</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.</span></indent>
    <verse>5</verse><span>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear;</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>but now mine eye seeth thee;</span></indent>
    <verse>6</verse><span>Wherefore I abhor myself,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and repent in dust and ashes.</span></indent>

  The LORD rebukes Job’s friends
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words unto Job, the
  LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite:</span><quote><span>
   My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends; for ye have
   not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.
   </span><verse>8</verse><span>Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and
   seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt
   offering, and my servant Job shall pray for you; for him will I accept;
   lest I deal with you after your folly, in that ye have not spoken of me
   the things which is right, like my servant Job.
  </span></quote>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the
  Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them; the LORD
  also accepted Job.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  Job is restored
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his
  friends; also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all
  they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with
  him in his house; and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the
  evil that the LORD had brought upon him; every man also gave him a piece
  of money, and everyone an earring of gold.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning; for
  he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand
  yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>He had also seven sons and three daughters.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And he called the name of the first Jemima; and the name of the second,
  Kezia; and the name of the third Keren-Happuch.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of
  Job; and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>After this lived Job a hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and
  his sons’ sons, even four generations.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>So Job died, being old and full of days.
