  <verse>1</verse><span>And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the
  tabernacle of the congregation, saying:</span><quote>
   <block>
    <verse>2</verse><span>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man of you
    bring an offering unto the LORD, ye shall bring your offering of the
    cattle, even of the herd, and of the flock.
    </span><verse>3</verse><span>If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male
    without blemish; he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door
    of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD.
    </span><verse>4</verse><span>And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and it
    shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>5</verse><span>And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD; and the priests, Aaron’s
    sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about upon the
    altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his pieces.
    </span><verse>7</verse><span>And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay
    the wood in order upon the fire;
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>and the priests, Aaron’s sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the
    fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar;
    </span><verse>9</verse><span>but his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water; and the priest
    shall burn all on the altar, to be a burnt sacrifice, an offering made
    by fire, of a sweet savor unto the LORD.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>10</verse><span>And if his offering be of the flocks, namely of the sheep, or of the
    goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without blemish.
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the
    LORD; and the priests, Aaron’s sons, shall sprinkle his blood round
    about upon the altar;
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>and he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat; and the
    priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which is
    upon the altar.
    </span><verse>13</verse><span>But he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water; and the priest
    shall bring it all, and burn it upon the altar; it is a burnt sacrifice,
    an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto the LORD.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>14</verse><span>And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD be of fowls,
    then he shall bring his offering of turtle doves, or of young pigeons.
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off his head,
    and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be wrung out at
    the side of the altar;
    </span><verse>16</verse><span>and he shall pluck away his crop with his feathers, and cast it beside
    the altar on the east part, by the place of the ashes.
    </span><verse>17</verse><span>And he shall cleave it with the wings thereof, but shall not divide it
    asunder; and the priest shall burn it upon the altar, upon the wood that
    is upon the fire; it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of
    a sweet savor unto the LORD.</span></block>

    </span><verse>12</verse><span>As for the oblation of the first-fruits, ye shall offer them unto the
    LORD; but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savor.
    </span><verse>13</verse><span>And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with salt;
    neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be
    lacking from thy meat offering; with all thine offerings thou shalt
    offer salt.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>14</verse><span>And if thou offer a meat offering of thy first-fruits unto the LORD,

    corn dried by the fire, even corn beaten out of full ears.
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon; it is a
    meat offering.
    </span><verse>16</verse><span>And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the beaten corn
    thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof;
    it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.</span></block>

    or fowl that may be eaten; he shall even pour out the blood thereof, and
    cover it with dust.
    </span><verse>14</verse><span>For it is the life of all flesh; the blood of it is for the life

  <verse>1</verse><span>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying:</span><quote>
   <block>
    <verse>2</verse><span>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, when a man shall
    make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the LORD by thy
    estimation.
    </span><verse>3</verse><span>And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto
    sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver,
    after the shekel of the sanctuary.
    </span><verse>4</verse><span>And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels.
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, then thy
    estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten
    shekels.
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy
    estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the
    female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver.
    </span><verse>7</verse><span>And if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a male, then thy
    estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten
    shekels.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>8</verse><span>But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present himself
    before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to his
    ability that vowed shall the priest value him.
    </span><verse>9</verse><span>And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the LORD, all
    that any man giveth of such unto the LORD shall be holy.
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a
    good; and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and the
    exchange thereof shall be holy.
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>And if it be any unclean
    beast, of which they do not offer a sacrifice unto the LORD, then he shall
    present the beast before the priest;
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>and the
    priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad; as thou valuest it, who
    art the priest, so shall it be.
    </span><verse>13</verse><span>But if he will
    at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth part thereof unto thy
    estimation.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>14</verse><span>And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the LORD, then
    the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad; as the priest
    shall estimate it, so shall it stand.
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add
    the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be
    his.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>16</verse><span>And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD some part of a field of his
    possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the seed thereof;
    a homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>17</verse><span>If he sanctify his field from the year of jubilee, according to thy
    estimation it shall stand.
    </span><verse>18</verse><span>But if he sanctify his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall
    reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain, even unto
    the year of the jubilee, and it shall be abated from thy estimation.
    </span><verse>19</verse><span>And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it, then he
    shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it
    shall be assured to him.
    </span><verse>20</verse><span>And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to
    another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.
    </span><verse>21</verse><span>But the field, when it goeth out in the jubilee, shall be holy unto the
    LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the
    priest’s.</span></block>

    <verse>22</verse><span>And if a man sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath bought, which
    is not of the fields of his possession;

    unto the year of the jubilee; and he shall give thine estimation in that
    day, as a holy thing unto the LORD.
    </span><verse>24</verse><span>In the year of the jubilee the field shall return unto him of whom it
    was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land did
    belong.</span></block>

    <verse>25</verse><span>And all thy estimation shall be according to the shekel of the
    sanctuary; twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>26</verse><span>Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD’s firstling,
    no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox, or sheep; it is the LORD’s.
    </span><verse>27</verse><span>And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it according to
    thine estimation, and shall add a fifth part of it thereto; or if it be
    not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy estimation.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>28</verse><span>Notwithstanding, no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto the
    LORD of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of the field of his
    possession, shall be sold or redeemed; every devoted thing is most holy
    unto the LORD.
