 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD, it came to pass,
  that the LORD spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses’ minister,
  saying:</span><quote>
   <block>
    <verse>2</verse><span>Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan,
    thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, even
    to the children of Israel.
    </span><verse>3</verse><span>Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I
    given unto you, as I said unto Moses.
    </span><verse>4</verse><span>From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the
    river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea
    toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast.
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of
    thy life; as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee; I will not fail
    thee, nor forsake thee.
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>Be strong and of a good courage; for unto this people shalt thou divide
    for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give
    them.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>7</verse><span>Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do
    according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee; turn
    not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest prosper
    whithersoever thou goest.
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt
    meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according
    to all that is written therein; for then thou shalt make thy way
    prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.
    </span><verse>9</verse><span>Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not
    afraid, neither be thou dismayed; for the LORD thy God is with thee
    whithersoever thou goest.</span></block>

  </quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying:</span><quote>
   <verse>11</verse><span>Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, “Prepare you
   victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in
   to possess the land, which the LORD your God giveth you to possess
   it.”</span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of
  Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying:</span><quote>
   <verse>13</verse><span>Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you,
   saying, “The LORD your God hath given you rest, and hath given you this
   land.”
   </span><verse>14</verse><span>Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land
   which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye shall pass before your
   brethren armed, all the mighty men of valor, and help them;
   </span><verse>15</verse><span>until the LORD have given your brethren rest, as he hath given you, and
   they also have possessed the land which the LORD your God giveth them;
   then ye shall return unto the land of your possession, and enjoy it,
   which Moses the LORD’s servant gave you on this side Jordan toward the
   sunrising.</span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>And they answered Joshua, saying:</span><quote><span>
   All that thou commandest us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us,
   we will go.
   </span><verse>17</verse><span>According as we hearkened unto
   Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto thee; only the LORD thy God
   be with thee, as he was with Moses.
   </span><verse>18</verse><span>Whosoever
   he be that doth rebel against thy commandment, and will not hearken unto
   thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shall be put to death; only
   be strong and of a good courage.

 <heading><span>Rahab and the spies
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>2
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy secretly,
  saying, “Go view the land, even Jericho.” And they went and came into a
  harlot’s house, named Rahab, and lodged there.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, “Behold, there came men in
  hither tonight of the children of Israel to search out the
  country.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying:</span><quote><span>
   Bring forth the men that are come to thee, which are entered into thine
   house; for they be come to search out all the country.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus:</span><quote><span>
   There came men unto me, but I wist not whence they were;
   </span><verse>5</verse><span>and it came to pass about the time of shutting
   of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out; whither the men
   went, I know not; pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them with
  the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords; and as
  soon as they which pursued after them were gone out, they shut the
  gate.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof;
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>and she said unto the men:</span><quote>
   <block><span>I know that the LORD hath given you the land, and that your terror is
   fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of
   you.
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>For we have heard how the LORD dried up
    the water of the Red Sea for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye
    did unto the two kings of the Amorites, that were on the other side
    Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>And as soon as we had heard these things, our
    hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man,
    because of you; for the LORD your God, he is God in heaven above, and in
    earth beneath.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>12</verse><span>Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD, since I have
    showed you kindness, that ye will also show kindness unto my father’s
    house, and give me a true token;
    </span><verse>13</verse><span>and that you will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren,
    and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from
    death.</span></block>

  </quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>And the men answered her:</span><quote><span>
   Our life for yours, if ye utter not this our business. And it shall be,
   when the LORD hath given us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly
   with thee.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>Then she let them down by a cord through the window; for her house was
  upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And she said unto them:</span><quote><span>
   Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you, and hide yourselves
   there three days, until the pursuers be returned; and afterward may ye go
   your way.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>And the men said unto her:</span><quote><span>
   We will be blameless of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear.
   </span><verse>18</verse><span>Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt
   bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us
   down by; and thou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy
   brethren, and all thy father’s household, home unto thee.
   </span><verse>19</verse><span>And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of
   the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head,
   and we will be guiltless; and whosoever shall be with thee in the house,
   his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him.
   </span><verse>20</verse><span>And if thou utter this our business, then we
   will be quit of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>And she said, “According unto your words, so be it.” And she sent them
  away, and they departed; and she bound the scarlet line in the
  window.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three days,
  until the pursuers were returned; and the pursuers sought them
  throughout all the way, but found them not.
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed
  over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all things that
  befell them;
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>and they said unto Joshua:</span><quote><span>
   Truly the LORD hath delivered into our hands all the land; for even all
   the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us.

  Crossing the Jordan
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>3
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim,
  and came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there
  before they passed over.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through
  the host;
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>and they commanded the people, saying:</span><quote><span>
   When ye see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests
   the Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after
   it.
   </span><verse>4</verse><span>Yet there shall be a space between you and
   it, about
   </span><superscript><span>a</span></superscript>
   <note>
    <superscript><span>a</span></superscript><span>3,000 ft or 900 m</span></note><span>two thousand cubits by measure; come
    not near unto it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go; for ye
    have not passed this way heretofore.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>And Joshua said unto the people:</span><quote><span>
   Sanctify yourselves; for tomorrow the LORD will do wonders among you.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying:</span><quote><span>
   Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And the LORD said unto Joshua:
  </span><quote><span>
   This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that
   they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee.
   </span><verse>8</verse><span>And thou shalt command the priests that bear the
   ark of the covenant, saying, “When ye are come to the brink of the water
   of Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan.”
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>And Joshua said unto the children of Israel:</span><quote><span>
   Come hither, and hear the words of the LORD your God.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>And Joshua said:</span><quote><span>
   Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will
   without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites,
   and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the
   Amorites, and the Jebusites.
   </span><verse>11</verse><span>Behold, the ark of
   the covenant of the LORD of all the earth passeth over before you into
   Jordan.
   </span><verse>12</verse><span>Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out of
   every tribe a man.
   </span><verse>13</verse><span>And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the
   priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the LORD of all the earth, shall
   rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off
   from the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand upon a
   heap.</span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to pass
  over the Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before
  the people;
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>and as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan, and the feet of
  the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim of the water, (for
  Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of harvest)
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>that the waters which came down from above stood and rose up upon a
  heap very far from the city Adam, that is beside Zaretan; and those that came down toward the
  sea of the plain, even the salt sea, failed, and were cut off; and the
  people passed over right against Jericho.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And the priests that bare the ark of the
  covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and
  all the Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people were
  passed clean over Jordan.
 </span></block>

 <chapter>4
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over Jordan,
  that the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying:</span><quote>
   <verse>2</verse><span>Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man,
   </span><verse>3</verse><span>and command ye them, saying, “Take you hence out of the midst of
   Jordan, out of the place where the priests’ feet stood firm, twelve
   stones, and ye shall carry them over with you, and leave them in the
   lodging place, where ye shall lodge this night.”</span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children
  of Israel, out of every tribe a man;
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>and Joshua said unto them:</span><quote><span>
   Pass over before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of Jordan,
   and take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according unto
   the number of the tribes of the children of Israel;
   </span><verse>6</verse><span>that this may be a sign among you, that when
   your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, “What mean ye by
   these stones?”
   </span><verse>7</verse><span>Then ye shall answer them, “That
   the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the
   LORD; when it passed over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off; and
   these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel forever.”
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up
  twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, as the LORD spake unto Joshua,
  according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, and
  carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged, and laid
  them down there.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the place
  where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant stood;
  and they are there unto this day.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>For the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of Jordan, until
  everything was finished that the LORD commanded Joshua to speak unto the
  people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua; and the people
  hasted and passed over.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over, that
  the ark of the LORD passed over, and the priests, in the presence of the
  people.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the tribe
  of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses
  spake unto them;
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>about forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the LORD unto
  battle, to the plains of Jericho.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and
  they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>And the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying:</span><quote>
   <verse>16</verse><span>Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come
   up out of Jordan.</span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying:
  </span><quote><span>Come ye up out of
  Jordan.</span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the covenant
  of the LORD were come up out of the midst of Jordan, and the soles of
  the priests’ feet were lifted up unto the dry land, that the waters of
  Jordan returned unto their place, and flowed over all his banks, as they
  did before.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first
  month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And those twelve stones, which they
  took out of Jordan, did Joshua pitch in Gilgal.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>And he spake unto the children of Israel,
  saying:
  </span><quote><span>
   When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, “What
   mean these stones?”
   </span><verse>22</verse><span>Then ye shall let your
   children know, saying, “Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.”
   </span><verse>23</verse><span>For the LORD your God dried up the waters of
   Jordan from before you, until ye were passed over, as the LORD your God
   did to the Red Sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were gone
   over;
   </span><verse>24</verse><span>that all the people of the earth might
   know the hand of the LORD, that it is mighty; that ye might fear the LORD
   your God forever.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <chapter>5
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which were on
  the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, which
  were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of Jordan
  from before the children of Israel, until we were passed over, that
  their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because
  of the children of Israel.

 <heading><span>
  Circumcision and Passover
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>At that time the LORD said unto Joshua:</span><quote><span>
   Make thee sharp knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the
   second time.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of
  Israel at the hill of the foreskins.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise; all the people that
  came out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war, died in the
  wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>Now all the people that came out were circumcised; but all the people
  that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of
  Egypt, them they had not circumcised.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till
  all the people that were men of war, which came out of Egypt, were
  consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD; unto whom the
  LORD sware that he would not show them the land, which the LORD sware
  unto their fathers that he would give us, a land that floweth with milk
  and honey.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them Joshua
  circumcised; for they were uncircumcised, because they had not
  circumcised them by the way.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the people,
  that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>And the LORD said unto Joshua:</span><quote><span>
   This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore
   the name of the place is called Gilgal unto this day.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the Passover on
  the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the
  Passover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the selfsame day.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn
  of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they
  did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  The fall of Jericho
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his
  eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with
  his sword drawn in his hand; and Joshua went unto him, and said unto
  him, “Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?”
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And he said, “Nay; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now
  come.”
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto
  him, “What saith my lord unto his servant?”
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>And
  the captain of the LORD’s host said unto Joshua, “Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is
  holy.” And Joshua did so.
 </span></block>

 <chapter>6
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of Israel;
  none went out, and none came in.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And the LORD said unto Joshua:</span><quote><span>
   See, I have given into thine hand Jericho, and the king thereof, and the
   mighty men of valor.
   </span><verse>3</verse><span>And ye shall compass the
   city, all ye men of war, and go round about the city once. Thus shalt thou
   do six days.
   </span><verse>4</verse><span>And seven priests shall bear before
   the ark seven trumpets of rams’ horns; and the seventh day ye shall
   compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the
   trumpets.
   </span><verse>5</verse><span>And it shall come to pass, that when
   they make a long blast with the ram’s horn, and when ye hear the sound of
   the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall
   of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man
   straight before him.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them:</span><quote><span>
   Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets
   of rams’ horns before the ark of the LORD.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>And he said unto the people:</span><quote><span>
   Pass on, and compass the city, and let him that is armed pass on before
   the ark of the LORD.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that the
  seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns passed on before
  the LORD, and blew with the trumpets; and the ark of the covenant of the
  LORD followed them.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets,
  and the rearward came after the ark, the priests going on, and blowing
  with the trumpets.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And Joshua had commanded the people, saying:</span><quote><span>
   Ye shall not shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any
   word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall
   ye shout.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about it once; and
  they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark
  of the LORD.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark
  of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the trumpets; and the
  armed men went before them; but the reward came after the ark of the
  LORD, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the
  camp. So they did six days.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the
  dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven
  times; only on that day they compassed the city seven times.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And it came to pass the seventh time, when the priests blew with the
  trumpets, Joshua said unto the people:</span><quote><span>
   Shout; for the LORD hath given you the city.
   </span><verse>17</verse><span>And the city shall be accursed, even it, and
   all that are therein, to the LORD; only Rahab the harlot shall live, she

  the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and
  they took the city.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>And they utterly destroyed all that was in the

  </span><verse>23</verse><span>And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and
  her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and
  they brought out all her kindred, and left them without the camp of

  <verse>24</verse><span>And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein; only the

  <verse>1</verse><span>But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing;

 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth-Aven, on
  the east side of Beth-El, and spake unto them, saying, “Go up and view

   Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go
   up and smite Ai; and make not all the people to labor thither; for they
   are but few.
  </span></quote>

  <verse>4</verse><span>So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men; and

  <verse>6</verse><span>And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before

   Alas, O Lord GOD, wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over

   </span><verse>9</verse><span>For the

   <block><span>Get thee up; wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face?

    of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they
    have put it even among their own stuff.
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>Therefore the children of Israel could not
    stand before their enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies,

    </span><verse>14</verse><span>In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes;
    and it shall be, that the tribe which the LORD taketh shall come

    take shall come man by man.
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>And it shall be, that he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be

  <verse>1</verse><span>And the LORD said unto Joshua:</span><quote><span>
   Fear not, neither be thou dismayed; take all the people of war with thee,

   and his people, and his city, and his land;
   </span><verse>2</verse><span>and
   thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and her king;
   only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for a prey
   unto yourselves; lay thee an ambush for the city behind it.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai; and
  Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valor, and sent them away
  by night.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And he commanded them, saying:
  </span><quote><span>
   Behold, ye shall lie in wait against the city, even behind the city; go
   not very far from the city, but be ye all ready.
   </span><verse>5</verse><span>And I, and all the people that are with me, will
   approach unto the city; and it shall come to pass, when they come out
   against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them,
   </span><verse>6</verse><span>(for they will come out after us) till we have
   drawn them from the city; for they will say, “They flee before us, as at
   the first; therefore we will flee before them.”
   </span><verse>7</verse><span>Then ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize
   upon the city; for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand.
   </span><verse>8</verse><span>And it shall be, when ye have taken the city,
   that ye shall set the city on fire; according to the commandment of the
   LORD shall ye do. See, I have commanded you.

  <verse>9</verse><span>Joshua therefore sent them forth; and they went to lie in ambush; and

  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people, and
  went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And all the people, even the people of war that were with him, went up,
  and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the north side
  of Ai; now there was a valley between them and Ai.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush
  between Beth-El and Ai, on the west side of the city.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And when they had set the people, even all the host that was on the

  Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.

  <verse>14</verse><span>And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted and
  rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to
  battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain;
  but he wist not that there were liers in ambush against him behind the

  </span><verse>15</verse><span>And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and

   Stretch out the spear that is in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it

  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And the ambush arose quickly out of their
  place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand; and they
  entered into the city, and took it, and hasted and set the city on fire.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they
  saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they

  midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side; and they
  smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the

  them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they
  were consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto Ai, and smote it
  with the edge of the sword.

  twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.

  <verse>1</verse><span>Now it came to pass, when Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem had heard how
  Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to
  Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the
  inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>that they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of
  the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all the men
  thereof were mighty.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>Wherefore Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of Hebron,
  and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and
  unto Debir king of Eglon, saying, “</span><verse>4</verse><span>Come up unto me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon; for it hath

  made war against it.

  slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goeth up to
  Beth-Horon, and smote them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were in the

  Five Amorite kings killed

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And it was told Joshua, saying, “The five kings are found hid in a cave
  at Makkedah.”
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>And Joshua said:</span><quote><span>
   Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave, and set men by it for to
   keep them;
   </span><verse>19</verse><span>and stay ye not, but pursue after
   your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter
   into their cities; for the LORD your God hath delivered them into your
   hand.

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an
  end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were
  consumed, that the rest which remained of them entered into fenced
  cities.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace;
  none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>Then said Joshua, “Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five
  kings unto me out of the cave.”
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the
  cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth,
  the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto Joshua,
  that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the captains
  of the men of war which went with him, “Come near, put your feet upon
  the necks of these kings.” And they came near, and put their feet upon
  the necks of them.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>And Joshua said unto them, “Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and of
  good courage; for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies against
  whom ye fight.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>26</verse><span>And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five
  trees; and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that
  Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them
  into the cave wherein they had been hid, and laid great stones in the
  cave’s mouth, which remain until this very day.

 <block>
  <verse>28</verse><span>And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of the
  sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and all the
  souls that were therein; he let none remain; and he did to the king of
  Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>29</verse><span>Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto Libnah,
  and fought against Libnah;
  </span><verse>30</verse><span>and the LORD delivered it also, and the king thereof, into the hand of
  Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls
  that were therein; he let none remain in it; but did unto the king
  thereof as he did unto the king of Jericho.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>31</verse><span>And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto Lachish,
  and encamped against it, and fought against it;
  </span><verse>32</verse><span>and the LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, which took it
  on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the
  souls that were therein, according to all that he had done to Libnah.
  </span><verse>33</verse><span>Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him
  and his people, until he had left him none remaining.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>34</verse><span>And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel with him; and
  they encamped against it, and fought against it;
  </span><verse>35</verse><span>and they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword,
  and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day,
  according to all that he had done to Lachish.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>36</verse><span>And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto Hebron;
  and they fought against it;
  </span><verse>37</verse><span>and they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king
  thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that were
  therein; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to
  Eglon; but destroyed it utterly, and all the souls that were
  therein.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>38</verse><span>And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and fought
  against it;
  </span><verse>39</verse><span>and he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof; and
  they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all
  the souls that were therein; he left none remaining; as he had done to
  Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king thereof; as he had done also
  to Libnah, and to her king.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>40</verse><span>So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of
  the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings; he left none
  remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of
  Israel commanded.
  </span><verse>41</verse><span>And Joshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea even unto Gaza, and all the
  country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon.
  </span><verse>42</verse><span>And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, because
  the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel.
  </span><verse>43</verse><span>And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those things,
  that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to
  the king of Achshaph,
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>and to the kings that were on the north of the mountains, and of the
  plains south of Chinneroth, and in the valley, and in the borders of Dor
  on the west,
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>and to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and to the Amorite,
  and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in
  the mountains, and to the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And they went out, they and all their hosts with
  them, much people, even as the sand that is upon the seashore in
  multitude, with horses and chariots very many.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And when all these kings were met together, they
  came and pitched together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And the LORD said unto Joshua:</span><quote><span>
   Be not afraid because of them; for tomorrow about this time will I deliver
   them up all slain before Israel; thou shalt hough their horses, and burn
   their chariots with fire.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the
  waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote them,
  and chased them unto great Zidon, and unto Misrephoth- maim, and unto
  the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left them
  none remaining.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>And Joshua did unto them as the LORD bade him; he houghed their horses,
  and burnt their chariots with fire.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote the king
  thereof with the sword; for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those
  kingdoms.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the
  sword, utterly destroying them; there was not any left to breathe; and
  he burnt Hazor with fire.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did
  Joshua take, and smote them with the edge of the sword, and he utterly
  destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the LORD commanded.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>But as for the cities that stood still in their strength, Israel burned
  none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of
  Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they smote with
  the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they
  any to breathe.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>As the LORD commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua,
  and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that the LORD commanded
  Moses.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south country, and
  all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain, and the mountain
  of Israel, and the valley of the same;
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>even from the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto Baal-gad in
  the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon; and all their kings he took,
  and smote them, and slew them.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save
  the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon; all other they took in battle.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>For it was of the LORD to destroy them utterly, because they hardened
  their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle; that they
  might have no favor, that they might destroy them in battle, as the LORD
  commanded Moses.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakim from the
  mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the
  mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel; Joshua
  destroyed them utterly with their cities.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>There was none of the Anakim left in the land of the children of
  Israel; only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD said unto
  Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according to
  their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from war.

  </span><verse>2</verse><span>By lot was their inheritance, as the LORD commanded by the hand of

  </span><verse>4</verse><span>For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim;

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And the lot of the children of Joseph fell from Jordan by Jericho, unto
  the water of Jericho on the east, to the wilderness that goeth up from
  Jericho throughout mount Beth- El,
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>and goeth out from Beth-El to Luz, and passeth along unto the borders
  of Archi to Ataroth,
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>and goeth down westward to the coast of Japhleti, unto the coast of
  Beth- Horon, the nether, and to Gezer; and the goings out thereof are at
  the sea.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>So the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their
  inheritance.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their families
  was thus; even the border of their inheritance on the east side was
  Ataroth-Addar, unto Beth-Horon the upper;
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>and the border went out toward the sea to Michmethah on the north side;
  and the border went about eastward unto Taanath-Shiloh, and passed by it
  on the east to Janohah;
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>and it went down from Janohah to Ataroth, and to Naarath, and came to
  Jericho, and went out at Jordan.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>The border went out from Tappuah westward unto the river Kanah; and the
  goings out thereof were at the sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe
  of the children of Ephraim by their families.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim were among the
  inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities with their
  villages.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>And they drave not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the
  Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites unto this day, and serve unto
  tribute.
 </span></block>

 <chapter>17
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the
  firstborn of Joseph; to wit, for Machir the first-born of Manasseh, the
  father of Gilead; because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead
  and Bashan.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>There was also a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh by their
  families; for the children of Abiezer, and for the children of Helek,
  and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem, and for
  the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida; these were the
  male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph by their families.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of
  Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters; and these are
  the names of his daughters, Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and
  Tirzah.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son
  of Nun, and before the princes, saying:</span><quote><span>
   The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  Therefore, according to the commandment of the LORD, he gave them an
  inheritance among the brethren of their father.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, besides
  the land of Gilead and Bashan, which were on the other side of Jordan;
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>because the daughters of Manasseh had an
  inheritance among his sons; and the rest of Manasseh’s sons had the land
  of Gilead.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>And the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that lieth
  before Shechem; and the border went along on the right hand unto the
  inhabitants of En-Tappuah.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>Now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah; but Tappuah on the border of
  Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim;
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>and the coast descended unto the river Kanah, southward of the river;
  these cities of Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh; the coast of
  Manasseh also was on the north side of the river, and the outgoings of
  it were at the sea;
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>southward it was Ephraim’s, and northward it was Manasseh’s, and the
  sea is his border; and they met together in Asher on the north, and in
  Issachar on the east.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Beth-Shean and her towns, and
  Ibleam and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, and the
  inhabitants of Endor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and
  her towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns, even three
  countries.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of
  those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxen strong,
  that they put the Canaanites to tribute; but did not utterly drive them
  out.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying:</span><quote><span>
   Why hast thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I am
   a great people, forasmuch as the LORD hath blessed me hitherto?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And Joshua answered them:</span><quote><span>
   If thou be a great people, then get thee up to the wood country, and cut
   down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the giants, if
   mount Ephraim be too narrow for thee.
  </span></quote>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>And the children of Joseph said:</span><quote><span>
   The hill is not enough for us; and all the Canaanites that dwell in the

   and her towns, and they who are of the valley of Jezreel.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and to
  Manasseh, saying: Thou art a great people, and hast great power; thou
  shalt not have one lot only;
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>but the mountain shall be thine; for it is a wood, and thou shalt cut
  it down; and the outgoings of it shall be thine; for thou shalt drive

 <chapter>20

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>The LORD also spake unto Joshua, saying:</span><quote>
   <verse>2</verse><span>Speak to the children of Israel, saying, appoint out for you cities of
   refuge, whereof I spake unto you by the hand of Moses;
   </span><verse>3</verse><span>that the slayer that killeth any person unawares and unwittingly may
   flee thither; and they shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood.
   </span><verse>4</verse><span>And when he that doth flee unto one of those cities shall stand at the
   entering of the gate of the city, and shall declare his cause in the
   ears of the elders of that city, they shall take him into the city unto
   them, and give him a place, that he may dwell among them.
   </span><verse>5</verse><span>And if the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall not
   deliver the slayer up into his hand; because he smote his neighbor
   unwittingly, and hated him not beforetime.
   </span><verse>6</verse><span>And he shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the congregation
   for judgment, and until the death of the high priest that shall be in
   those days; then shall the slayer return, and come unto his own city,
   and unto his own house, unto the city from whence he fled.</span></quote>

  in the wilderness upon the plain out of the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth
  in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe
  of Manasseh.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>These were the cities appointed for all the children of Israel, and for
  the stranger that sojourneth among them, that whosoever killeth any
  person at unawares might flee thither, and not die by the hand of the
  avenger of blood, until he stood before the congregation.

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe

  said unto them:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, and

   Return with much riches unto your tents, and with very much cattle, with

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>And when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that are in the land of
  Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half

   <block><span>What trespass is this that ye have committed against the God of Israel, to
   turn away this day from following the LORD, in that ye have builded you an
   altar, that ye might rebel this day against the LORD?
    </span><verse>17</verse><span>Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from
    which we are not cleansed until this day, although there was a plague in
    the congregation of the LORD,
    </span><verse>18</verse><span>but that ye must
    turn away this day from following the LORD? And it will be, seeing ye

    </span><verse>20</verse><span>Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing,

    <verse>22</verse><span>The LORD God of gods, the LORD God of gods, he knoweth, and Israel he
    shall know; if it be in rebellion, or if in transgression against the

    </span><verse>23</verse><span>that we have built us an altar to turn from following the LORD, or if
    to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering, or if to offer peace
    offerings thereon, let the LORD himself require it;
    </span><verse>24</verse><span>and if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing, saying, “In
    time to come your children might speak unto our children, saying, ‘What
    have ye to do with the LORD God of Israel?’”
    </span><verse>25</verse><span>For the LORD hath made Jordan a border between us and you, ye children

    your children make our children cease from fearing the LORD.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>26</verse><span>Therefore we said, “Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not for

    after us, that we might do the service of the LORD before him with our

    that your children may not say to our children in time to come, ‘Ye have
    no part in the LORD.’”</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>28</verse><span>Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should so say to us or

    offerings, nor for sacrifices; but it is a witness between us and

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And it came to pass, a long time after that the LORD had given rest
  unto Israel from all their enemies round about, that Joshua waxed old
  and stricken in age.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And Joshua called for all Israel, and for their elders, and for their
  heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and said unto
  them:</span><quote>
   <block><span>I am old and stricken in age;
    </span><verse>3</verse><span>and ye have seen
    all that the LORD your God hath done unto all these nations because of
    you; for the LORD your God is he that hath fought for you.
    </span><verse>4</verse><span>Behold, I have divided unto you by lot these
    nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan,
    with all the nations that I have cut off, even unto the great sea
    westward.
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>And the LORD your God, he shall expel
    them from before you, and drive them from out of your sight; and ye shall
    possess their land, as the LORD your God hath promised unto you.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>6</verse><span>Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written
    in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside therefrom to the
    right hand or to the left;
    </span><verse>7</verse><span>that ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you;
    neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by
    them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them;
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>but cleave unto the LORD your God, as ye have done unto this day.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>9</verse><span>For the LORD hath driven out from before you great nations and strong;
    but as for you, no man hath been able to stand before you unto this day.
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>One man of you shall chase a thousand; for the LORD your God, he it is
    that fighteth for you, as he hath promised you.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>11</verse><span>Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love the LORD your
    God.
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>Else,
    if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant of these
    nations, even these that remain among you, and shall make marriages with
    them, and go in unto them, and they to you;
    </span><verse>13</verse><span>know for a certainty that the LORD your God
    will no more drive out any of these nations from before you; but they
    shall be snares and traps unto you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns
    in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land which the LORD your
    God hath given you.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>14</verse><span>And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth; and ye know
    in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing hath failed
    of all the good things which the LORD your God spake concerning you; all
    are come to pass unto you, and not one thing hath failed thereof.
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all good things are come upon
    you, which the LORD your God promised you; so shall the LORD bring upon
    you all evil things, until he have destroyed you from off this good land
    which the LORD your God hath given you.
    </span><verse>16</verse><span>When ye have transgressed the covenant of the LORD your God, which he
    commanded you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them; then shall the anger
    of the LORD be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off
    the good land which he hath given unto you.</span></block>

  The covenant reviewed at Shechem
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>24
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for
  the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for
  their officers; and they presented themselves before God.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And Joshua said unto all the people:</span><quote>
   <block><span>Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, your fathers dwelt on the other side of
   the flood in old time, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father
   of Nachor; and they served other gods.
    </span><verse>3</verse><span>And I
    took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood, and led him
    throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him
    Isaac.
    </span><verse>4</verse><span>And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau; and
    I gave unto Esau mount Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children
    went down into Egypt.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>5</verse><span>I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that
    which I did among them; and afterward I brought you out.
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>And I brought your fathers out of Egypt; and ye came unto the sea; and
    the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto
    the Red Sea.
    </span><verse>7</verse><span>And when they cried unto the LORD, he put darkness between you and the
    Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your
    eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt; and ye dwelt in the wilderness
    a long season.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>8</verse><span>And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt on the
    other side Jordan; and they fought with you; and I gave them into your
    hand, that ye might possess their land; and I destroyed them from before
    you.
    </span><verse>9</verse><span>Then Balak the son of Zipor, king of Moab, arose and warred against
    Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you;
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>but I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed you still; so
    I delivered you out of his hand.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>11</verse><span>And ye went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho; and the men of Jericho
    fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the
    Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the
    Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand.
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>And I sent the hornet before you, which drave them out from before you,
    even the two kings of the Amorites; but not with thy sword, nor with thy
    bow.
    </span><verse>13</verse><span>And I have given you a land for which ye did not labor, and cities
    which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the vineyards and
    olive-yards which ye planted not do ye eat.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>14</verse><span>Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in truth;
    and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the
    flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the LORD.
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day
    whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were
    on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose
    land ye dwell; but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.</span></block>

  </quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>And the people answered and said:</span><quote><span>
   God forbid that we should forsake the LORD, to serve other gods;
   </span><verse>17</verse><span>for the LORD our God, he it is that brought us
   up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage,
   and which did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the
   way wherein we went, and among all the people through whom we passed;
   </span><verse>18</verse><span>and the LORD drave out from before us all the
   people, even the Amorites which dwelt in the land; therefore will we also
   serve the LORD; for he is our God.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>And Joshua said unto the people:</span><quote><span>
   Ye cannot serve the LORD; for he is a holy God; he is a jealous God; he
   will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins.
   </span><verse>20</verse><span>If ye forsake the LORD, and serve strange gods,
   then he will turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath
   done you good.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>And the people said unto Joshua, “Nay; but we will serve the LORD.”
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>And Joshua said unto the people, “Ye are witnesses against yourselves
  that ye have chosen you the LORD, to serve him.” And they said, “We are
  witnesses.”
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>“Now therefore put away,” said he, “the strange gods which are among
  you, and incline your heart unto the LORD God of Israel.”
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>And the people said unto Joshua, “The LORD our God will we serve, and
  his voice will we obey.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>25</verse><span>So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a
  statute and an ordinance in Shechem.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a
  great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that was by the sanctuary
  of the LORD.
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>And Joshua said unto all the people:</span><quote><span>
   Behold, this stone shall be a witness unto us; for it hath heard all the
   words of the LORD which he spake unto us; it shall be therefore a witness
   unto you, lest ye deny your God.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>28</verse><span>So Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his inheritance.

 <block>
  <verse>29</verse><span>And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the
  servant of the LORD, died, being a hundred and ten years old.
  </span><verse>30</verse><span>And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-Serah,
  which is in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of Gaash.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>31</verse><span>And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of
  the elders that overlived Joshua, and which had known all the works of
  the LORD, that he had done for Israel.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>32</verse><span>And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of
  Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought
  of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for a hundred pieces of
  silver; and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>33</verse><span>And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill that
  pertained to Phinehas his son, which was given him in mount
  Ephraim.
