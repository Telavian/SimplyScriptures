  Israel fights the remaining Canaanites
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>1
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of
  Israel asked the LORD, saying:</span><quote><span>
   Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against
   them?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>And the LORD said:</span><quote><span>
   Judah shall go up; behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>And Judah said unto Simeon his brother:</span><quote><span>
   Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and
   I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the
  Perizzites into their hand; and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand
  men.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And they found Adoni-Bezek in Bezek; and they fought against him, and
  they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>But Adoni-Bezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and
  cut off his thumbs and his great toes.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And Adoni-Bezek said, “Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs
  and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table; as I
  have done, so God hath requited me.” And they brought him to Jerusalem,
  and there he died.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken
  it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the
  Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south, and in the
  valley.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron; now the
  name of Hebron before was Kirjath-Arba; and they slew Sheshai, and
  Ahiman, and Talmai.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir; and the name
  of Debir before was Kirjath-Sepher;
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>and Caleb said, “He that smiteth Kirjath-Sepher, and taketh it, to him
  will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.”
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, took it; and he
  gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to ask of
  her father a field; and she lighted from off her ass; and Caleb said
  unto her, “What wilt thou?”
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>And she said unto him, “Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a
  south land; give me also springs of water.” And Caleb gave her the upper
  springs and the nether springs.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>And the children of the Kenite, Moses’ father-in-law, went up out of
  the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of
  Judah, which lieth in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt among
  the people.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites
  that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the
  city was called Hormah.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with coast
  thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>And the LORD was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants of the
  mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because
  they had chariots of iron.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said; and he expelled thence
  the three sons of Anak.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that
  inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of
  Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Beth-El; and the
  LORD was with them.
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>And the house of Joseph sent to descry Beth-El. Now the name of the
  city before was Luz.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto
  him, “Show us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will
  show thee mercy.”
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>And when he showed them the entrance into the city, they smote the city
  with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all his family.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and
  called the name thereof Luz; which is the name thereof unto this
  day.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>27</verse><span>Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Beth-Shean and her
  towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and her
  towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the inhabitants
  of Megiddo and her towns; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the
  Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out.
  </span><verse>29</verse><span>Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but
  the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.
  </span><verse>30</verse><span>Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the
  inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became
  tributaries.
  </span><verse>31</verse><span>Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the
  inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of
  Aphik, nor of Rehob;
  </span><verse>32</verse><span>but the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the
  land; for they did not drive them out.
  </span><verse>33</verse><span>Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Beth-Shemesh, nor the
  inhabitants of Beth-Anath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the
  inhabitants of the land; nevertheless, the inhabitants of Bethshemesh
  and of Beth-Anath became tributaries unto them.
  </span><verse>34</verse><span>And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain; for they
  would not suffer them to come down to the valley;
  </span><verse>35</verse><span>but the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in
  Shaalbim; yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they
  became tributaries.
  </span><verse>36</verse><span>And the coast of the Amorites was from the going up to Akrabbim, from
  the rock, and upward.

  Disobedience and defeat
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>2
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said:</span><quote><span>
   I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you unto the land which
   I sware unto your fathers; and I said, “I will never break my covenant
   with you.
   </span><verse>2</verse><span>And ye shall make no league with the
   inhabitants of this land; ye shall throw down their altars;” but ye have
   not obeyed my voice; why have ye done this?
   </span><verse>3</verse><span>Wherefore I also said, “I will not drive them
   out from before you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their
   gods shall be a snare unto you.”
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>And it came to pass, when the angel of the LORD spake these words unto
  all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and
  wept.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And they called the name of that place Bochim; and they sacrificed
  there unto the LORD.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went
  every man unto his inheritance to possess the land.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days
  of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of
  the LORD, that he did for Israel.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being a
  hundred and ten years old.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-Heres,
  in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of Gaash.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers; and
  there arose another generation after them, which knew not the LORD, nor
  yet the works which he had done for Israel.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And the
  children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim;
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>and they forsook the LORD God of their fathers,
  which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of
  the gods of the people that were round about them, and bowed themselves
  unto them, and provoked the LORD to anger.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And
  they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And the anger of the LORD was hot against
  Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled
  them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so
  that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the
  LORD was against them for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had
  sworn unto them; and they were greatly distressed.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, which delivered them out of the
  hand of those that spoiled them.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they went a
  whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto them, they turned
  quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the
  commandments of the LORD; but they did not so.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with the
  judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days
  of the judge; for the LORD hearkened because of their groanings by
  reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they returned, and
  corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in following other gods to
  serve them, and to bow down unto them; they ceased not from their own
  doings, nor from their stubborn way.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said:</span><quote><span>
   Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I commanded
   their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice;
   </span><verse>21</verse><span>I also will not henceforth drive out any from
   before them of the nations which Joshua left when he died;
   </span><verse>22</verse><span>that through them I may prove Israel, whether
   they will keep the way of the LORD to walk therein, as their fathers did
   keep it, or not.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>Therefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them out
  hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua.
 </span></block>

 <chapter>3
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Now these are the nations which the LORD left to prove Israel by them,
  even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan;
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>only that the generations of the children of Israel might know to teach
  them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof;
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the
  Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount
  Baal-Hermon unto the entering in of Hamath.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would
  hearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their
  fathers by the hand of Moses.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and
  Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites;
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>and they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their
  daughters to their sons, and served their gods.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  Othniel
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and
  forgat the LORD their God and served Baalim and the groves.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold
  them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia; and the
  children of Israel served Chushan-Rishathaim eight years.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised up
  a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, even Othniel
  the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And the
  Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to
  war; and the LORD delivered Chushan-Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into
  his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushan-Rishathaim.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And the land had rest forty years and Othniel
  the son of Kenaz died.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  Ehud
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD; and
  the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because
  they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and
  smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen
  years.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised
  them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man
  left-handed; and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon
  the king of Moab.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and
  he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab; and Eglon was a
  very fat man.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>And when he made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people
  that bare the present.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and
  said, “I have a secret errand unto thee, O king;” who said, “Keep
  silence.” And all that stood by him went out from him.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlor, which he
  had for himself alone; and Ehud said, “I have a message from God unto
  thee.” And he arose out of his seat.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right
  thigh, and thrust it into his belly;
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>and the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the
  blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the
  dirt came out.
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the
  parlor upon him, and locked them.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that,
  behold, the doors of the parlor were locked, they said, “Surely he
  covereth his feet in his summer chamber.”
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>And they tarried till they were ashamed; and, behold, he opened not the
  doors of the parlor; therefore they took a key, and opened them; and,
  behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>26</verse><span>And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries,
  and escaped unto Seirath.
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the
  mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from
  the mount, and he before them.
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>And he said unto them, “Follow after me; for the LORD hath delivered
  your enemies the Moabites into your hand.”
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab,
  and suffered not a man to pass over.
  </span><verse>29</verse><span>And they
  slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men
  of valor; and there escaped not a man.
  </span><verse>30</verse><span>So Moab
  was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest
  fourscore years.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  Shamgar
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>31</verse><span>And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the
  Philistines six hundred men with an ox-goad; and he also delivered
  Israel.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  Deborah
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>4
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD,
  when Ehud was dead.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that
  reigned in Hazor;
  the captain of whose host was Sisera, which dwelt in Harosheth of the
  Gentiles.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And the children of Israel cried unto
  the LORD; for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he
  mightily oppressed the children of Israel.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at
  that time.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah, between Ramah and Beth-El
  in mount Ephraim; and the children of Israel came up to her for
  judgment.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedeshnaphtali,
  and said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   Hath not the LORD God of Israel commanded, saying: Go and draw toward
   mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of
   Naphtali and the children of Zebulun?
   </span><verse>7</verse><span>And I will
   draw unto thee, to the river Kishon, Sisera the captain of Jabin’s army,
   with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into thine
   hand.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>And Barak said unto her:</span><quote><span>
   If thou wilt go with me, then I will go; but if thou wilt not go with me,
   then I will not go.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>And she said:</span><quote><span>
   I will surely go with thee, notwithstanding the journey that thou takest
   shall not be for thine honor; for the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand
   of a woman.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to
  Kedesh, and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet; and Deborah went
  up with him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the
  father-in-law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and
  pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>And they showed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to
  mount Tabor.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred
  chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth
  of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>And Deborah said unto Barak:</span><quote><span>
   Up; for this is the day in which the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thine
   hand; is not the LORD gone out before thee?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  So Barak, went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all his
  chariots, and all his hosts, with the edge of the sword before Barak, so
  that Sisera lighted down off his chariot, and fled away on his feet.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after
  the host, unto Harosheth of the Gentiles; and all the host of Sisera fell
  upon the edge of the sword; and there was not a man left.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of
  Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor
  and the house of Heber the Kenite.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, “Turn in, my lord,
  turn in to me; fear not.” And when he had turned in unto her into the
  tent, she covered him with a mantle.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And he said unto her, “Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink;
  for I am thirsty.” And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink;
  and covered him.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>Again he said unto her. “Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall
  be, when any man doth come and inquire of thee, and say, ‘Is there any
  man here?’ that thou shalt say, ‘No.’”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>Then Jael Heber’s wife took a nail of the tent, and took a hammer in
  her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the nail into his temples,
  and fastened it into the ground; for he was fast asleep, and weary. So
  he died.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and
  said unto him, “Come, and I will show thee the man whom thou seekest.” And when he came into her tent, behold, Sisera lay dead, and
  the nail was in his temples.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children
  of Israel.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>And
  the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed against Jabin
  the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.

  The song of Deborah
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>5
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day,
  saying:</span><quote>
   <block>
    <verse>2</verse><span>Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the people
    willingly offered themselves.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>3</verse><span>Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, even I, will sing unto the
    LORD; I will sing praise to the LORD God of Israel.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>4</verse><span>Lord, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out of the
    field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds
    also dropped water.
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>The mountains melted from before the LORD, even that Sinai from before
    the LORD God of Israel.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>6</verse><span>In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the
    highways were unoccupied, and the travelers walked through byways.
    </span><verse>7</verse><span>The inhabitants of the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel, until
    that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>They chose new gods; then was war in the gates; was there a shield or
    spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?
    </span><verse>9</verse><span>My heart is toward the governors of Israel, that offered themselves
    willingly among the people. Bless ye the LORD.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>10</verse><span>Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment, and walk
    by the way.
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>They that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places of
    drawing water, there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the LORD,
    even the righteous acts toward the inhabitants of his villages in
    Israel; then shall the people of the LORD go down to the gates.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>12</verse><span>Awake, awake, Deborah; awake, awake, utter a song; arise, Barak, and
    lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>13</verse><span>Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles among the
    people; the LORD made me have dominion over the mighty.
    </span><verse>14</verse><span>Out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek; after thee,
    Benjamin, among thy people; out of Machir came down governors, and out
    of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer.
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; even Issachar, and also

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD; and the
  LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel; and because of the
  Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the
  mountains, and caves, and strongholds.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and
  the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against
  them;
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>and they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the
  earth, till thou came unto Gaza, and left no sustenance for Israel,
  neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came as
  grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their camels were without
  number; and they entered into the land to destroy it.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; and the
  children of Israel cried unto the LORD.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD
  because of the Midianites,
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>that the LORD sent a prophet unto the children of Israel, which said
  unto them:</span><quote><span>
   Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and
   brought you forth out of the house of bondage;
   </span><verse>9</verse><span>and I delivered you out of the hand of the
   Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drave them
   out from before you, and gave you their land;
   </span><verse>10</verse><span>and I said unto you, “I am the LORD your God;
   fear not the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell;” but ye have
   not obeyed my voice.

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak which was in

   The LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valor.

  <verse>13</verse><span>And Gideon said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   O my Lord, if the LORD be with us, why then is all this befallen us? And
   where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of, saying, “Did not
   the LORD bring us up from Egypt?” But now the LORD hath forsaken us, and
   delivered us into the hands of the Midianites.

  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And the angel of God said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and

  And he did so.

  <verse>25</verse><span>And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   Take thy father’s young bullock, even the second bullock of seven years

   the grove that is by it;
   </span><verse>26</verse><span>and build an altar

   take the second bullock, and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the

 <block>
  <verse>27</verse><span>Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD had said

  night.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>28</verse><span>And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the
  altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was by it,
  and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built.
  </span><verse>29</verse><span>And they said one to another, “Who hath done
  this thing?” And when they inquired and asked, they said, “Gideon the son
  of Joash hath done this thing.”
  </span><verse>30</verse><span>Then the men of
  the city said unto Joash:
  </span><quote><span>
   Bring out thy son, that he may die, because he hath cast down the altar of
   Baal, and because he hath cut down the grove that was by it.

  <verse>31</verse><span>And Joash said unto all that stood against him:</span><quote><span>
   Will ye plead for Baal? Will ye save him? He that will plead for him, let

   plead for himself, because one hath cast down his altar.
  </span></quote>

  <verse>32</verse><span>Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, “Let Baal plead

 <block>
  <verse>33</verse><span>Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east

  </span><verse>34</verse><span>But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and
  Abiezer was gathered after him.
  </span><verse>35</verse><span>And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was gathered

  <verse>36</verse><span>And Gideon said unto God:</span><quote><span>
   If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said,

   as thou hast said.

  <verse>38</verse><span>And it was so; for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the

  water.
  </span><verse>39</verse><span>And Gideon said unto God:</span><quote><span>
   Let not thine anger be hot against me, and I will speak but this once; let
   me prove, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry
   only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.

 <chapter>7
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with him,
  rose up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod; so that the host of
  the Midianites were on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in
  the valley.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And the LORD said unto Gideon:</span><quote><span>
   The people that are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites
   into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, “Mine
   own hand hath saved me.”
   </span><verse>3</verse><span>Now therefore go to,
   proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, “Whosoever is fearful and
   afraid, let him return and depart early from mount Gilead.”
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there
  remained ten thousand.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And the LORD said unto
  Gideon:
  </span><quote><span>
   The people are yet too many; bring them down unto the water, and I will
   try them for thee there; and it shall be, that of whom I say unto thee,
   “This shall go with thee,” the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever
   I say unto thee, “This shall not go with thee,” the same shall not go.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>So he brought down the people unto the water; and the LORD said unto
  Gideon: Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog
  lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth
  down upon his knees to drink.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth,
  were three hundred men; but all the rest of the people bowed down upon
  their knees to drink water.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And the LORD said unto Gideon:</span><quote><span>
   By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the
   Midianites into thine hand; and let all the other people go every man unto
   his place.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets; and he
  sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent, and retained those
  three hundred men; and the host of Midian was beneath him in the
  valley.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered it into thine
   hand.
   </span><verse>10</verse><span>But if thou fear to go down, go thou with
   Phurah thy servant down to the host;
   </span><verse>11</verse><span>and thou
   shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened
   to go down unto the host.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  Then went he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed
  men that were in the host.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And the Midianites
  and the Amalekites and all children of the east lay along in the valley
  like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as
  the sand by the seaside for multitude.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a dream
  unto his fellow, and said:</span><quote><span>
   Behold, I dreamed a dream, and lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the
   host of Midian, and came unto a tent, and smote it that it fell, and
   overturned it, that the tent lay along.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>And his fellow answered and said:</span><quote><span>
   This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of
   Israel; for into his hand hath God delivered Midian, and all the host.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the
  interpretation thereof, that he worshiped, and returned into the host of
  Israel, and said:</span><quote><span>
   Arise; for the LORD hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put a
  trumpet in every man’s hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the
  pitchers.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And he said unto them:</span><quote><span>
   Look on me, and do likewise; and, behold, when I come to the outside of
   the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall ye do.
   </span><verse>18</verse><span>When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are
   with me, then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and
   say, “The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.”
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the
  outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and they had
  but newly set the watch; and they blew the trumpets, and brake the
  pitchers that were in their hands.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And the three companies blew the trumpets and brake the pitchers, and
  held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right
  hands to blow withal; and they cried, “The sword of the LORD, and of
  Gideon.”
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>And they stood every man in his place round about the camp; and all the
  host ran, and cried, and fled.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every man’s
  sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host; and the host
  fled to Beth-Shittah in Zererath, and to the border of Abelmeholah, unto
  Tabbath.
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali, and
  out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after the Midianites.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying,
  “Come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters unto
  Beth-Barah and Jordan.”
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and took the
  waters unto Beth-Barah and Jordan.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>And they
  took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb upon
  the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued
  Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side
  Jordan.

 <chapter>8

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And the men of Ephraim said unto him, “Why hast thou served us thus,
  that thou calledst not, when thou wentest to fight with the Midianites?”
  And they did chide with him sharply.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And he said unto them, “What have I done now in comparison of you? Is
  not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of
  Abiezer?
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and
  Zeeb; and what was I able to do in comparison of you?” Then their anger
  was abated toward him, when he had said that.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>And Gideon came to Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three hundred
  men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing them.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And he said unto the men of Succoth, “Give, I pray you, loaves of bread
  unto the people that follow me; for they be faint, and I am pursuing
  after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.”
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And the princes of Succoth said, “Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna
  now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thine army?”
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And Gideon said, “Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah and
  Zalmunna into mine hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of
  the wilderness and with briers.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>And he went up thence to Penuel, and spake unto them likewise; and the
  men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered him.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>And he spake also unto the men of Penuel, saying, “When I come again in
  peace, I will break down this tower.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about
  fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the hosts of the

  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east

  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, and took the
  two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the
  host.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun was up,
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>and caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and inquired of him; and
  he described unto him the princes of Succoth, and the elders thereof,
  even threescore and seventeen men.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said:</span><quote><span>
   Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, with whom ye did upbraid me, saying, “Are the

  <verse>16</verse><span>And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness, and
  briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, “What manner of men were they
  whom ye slew at Tabor?” And they answered, “As thou art, so were they;
  each one resembled the children of a king.”
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And he said, “They were my brethren, even the sons of my mother; as the
  LORD liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you.”
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And he said unto Jether his firstborn, “Up, and slay them.”
 </span></block>

 <block><span>But the youth drew not his sword; for he feared, because he was yet a
 youth.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, “Rise thou, and
  fall upon us; for as the man is, so is his strength.” And Gideon arose,
  and slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that were on
  their camels’ necks.

  Gideon refuses to rule

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, “Rule thou over us, both thou,

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>And Gideon said unto them, “I would desire a

  (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>And they answered, “We will willingly give
  them.” And they spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the
  earrings of his prey.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>And the weight of the
  golden earrings that he requested was a thousand and
  </span><note>
   <superscript><span>a</span></superscript><span>43 lb or 20 kg</span></note><span>seven hundred shekels of gold; besides
   ornaments, and collars, and purple raiment that was on the kings of
   Midian, and besides the chains that were about their camels’ necks.
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in

  <verse>28</verse><span>Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that they

  <verse>29</verse><span>And Jerubbaal the son Joash went and dwelt in his own house.

  <verse>1</verse><span>And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother’s
  brethren, and communed with them, and with all the family of the house
  of his mother’s father, saying:</span><quote>
   <verse>2</verse><span>Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, whether is
   better for you, either that all the sons of Jerubbaal, which are
   threescore and ten persons, reign over you, or that one reign over you?
   Remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.</span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>And his mother’s brethren spake of him in the
  ears of all the men of Shechem all these words; and their hearts inclined
  to follow Abimelech; for they said, “He is our brother.”
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And they gave him

  <note>
   <superscript><span>b</span></superscript><span>1.8 lb or 800 g</span></note><span>threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the
   house of Baal-Berith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light persons,
   which followed him.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And he went unto his
  father’s house at Ophrah, and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal,
  being threescore and ten persons, upon one stone; notwithstanding, yet
  Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And all the men of Shechem gathered together,
  and all the house of Millo, and went and made Abimelech king, by the plain
  of the pillar that was in Shechem.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood in the top of mount
  Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said unto them:</span><quote>
   <block><span>Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, that God may hearken unto you.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>8</verse><span>The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and they
    said unto the olive tree, “Reign thou over us.”
    </span><verse>9</verse><span>But the olive tree said unto them, “Should I leave my fatness,
    wherewith by me they honor God and man, and go to be promoted over the
    trees?”</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>10</verse><span>And the trees said to the fig tree, “Come thou, and reign over us.”
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>But the fig tree said unto them, “Should I forsake my sweetness, and my
    good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees?”</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>12</verse><span>Then said the trees unto the vine, “Come thou, and reign over us.”
    </span><verse>13</verse><span>And the vine said unto them, “Should I leave my wine, which cheereth
    God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?”</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>14</verse><span>Then said all the trees unto the bramble, “Come thou, and reign over
    us.”
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>And the bramble said unto the trees, “If in truth ye anoint me king
    over you, then come and put your trust in my shadow; and if not, let
    fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.”</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>16</verse><span>Now therefore, if ye have done truly and sincerely, in that ye have
    made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his
    house, and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands;
    </span><verse>17</verse><span>(for my father fought for you, and adventured his life far, and
    delivered you out of the hand of Midian;
    </span><verse>18</verse><span>and ye are risen up against my father’s house this day, and have slain
    his sons, threescore and ten persons, upon one stone, and have made
    Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem,
    because he is your brother)
    </span><verse>19</verse><span>if ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and with his
    house this day, then rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice
    in you;
    </span><verse>20</verse><span>but if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of
    Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of
    Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech.</span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there, for
  fear of Abimelech his brother.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel,
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem;
  and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech,
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>that the cruelty done to the threescore and ten sons of Jerubbaal might
  come, and their blood be laid upon Abimelech their brother, which slew
  them, and upon the men of Shechem, which aided him in the killing of his
  brethren.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of the
  mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them; and it
  was told Abimelech.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>26</verse><span>And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to
  Shechem; and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him.
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards, and
  trode the grapes, and made merry, and went into the house of their god,
  and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech.
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>And Gaal the son of Ebed said:</span><quote><span>
   Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? Is not he
   the son of Jerubbaal? And Zebul his officer? Serve the men of Hamor the
   father of Shechem; for why should we serve him?
   </span><verse>29</verse><span>And would to God these people were under my
   hand! Then would I remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase
   thine army, and come out.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>30</verse><span>And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of
  Ebed, his anger was kindled.
  </span><verse>31</verse><span>And he sent messengers unto Abimelech privily, saying:</span><quote><span>
   Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren be come to Shechem; and,
   behold, they fortify the city against thee.
   </span><verse>32</verse><span>Now
   therefore up by night, thou and the people that is with thee, and lie in
   wait in the field;
   </span><verse>33</verse><span>and it shall be, that in the
   morning, as soon as the sun is up, thou shalt rise early, and set upon the
   city; and, behold, when he and the people that is with him come out
   against thee, then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>34</verse><span>And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him, by night,
  and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.
  </span><verse>35</verse><span>And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering of the
  gate of the city; and Abimelech rose up, and the people that were with
  him, from lying in wait.
  </span><verse>36</verse><span>And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul:</span><quote><span>
   Behold, there come people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul
   said unto him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they were men.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>37</verse><span>And Gaal spoke again and said:</span><quote><span>
   See, there come people down by the middle of the land, and another company
   come along by the plain of Meonenim.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>38</verse><span>Then said Zebul unto him:</span><quote><span>
   Where is now thy mouth, wherewith thou saidst, “Who is Abimelech, that we
   should serve him?” Is not this the people that thou hast despised? Go out,
   I pray now, and fight with them.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>39</verse><span>And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.
  </span><verse>40</verse><span>And
  Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many were overthrown and
  wounded, even unto the entering of the gate.
  </span><verse>41</verse><span>And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah; and Zebul thrust
  out Gaal and his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>42</verse><span>And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the
  field; and they told Abimelech.
  </span><verse>43</verse><span>And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid
  wait in the field, and looked, and, behold, the people were come forth
  out of the city; and he rose up against them, and smote them.
  </span><verse>44</verse><span>And Abimelech, and the company that was with him, rushed forward, and
  stood in the entering of the gate of the city; and the two other
  companies ran upon all the people that were in the fields, and slew
  them.
  </span><verse>45</verse><span>And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the
  city, and slew the people that was therein, and beat down the city, and
  sowed it with salt.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>46</verse><span>And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they entered
  into a hold of the house of the god Berith.
  </span><verse>47</verse><span>And it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of Shechem
  were gathered together.
  </span><verse>48</verse><span>And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that
  were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a
  bough from the trees, and took it, and laid it on his shoulder, and said
  unto the people that were with him:</span><quote><span>
   What ye have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>49</verse><span>And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed
  Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold on fire upon them;
  so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand
  men and women.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>50</verse><span>Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took
  it.
  </span><verse>51</verse><span>But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all the
  men and women, and all they of the city, and shut it to them, and gat
  them up to the top of the tower.
  </span><verse>52</verse><span>And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and went hard
  unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire.
  </span><verse>53</verse><span>And a certain woman cast a piece of a
  millstone upon Abimelech’s head, and all to brake his skull.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>54</verse><span>Then he called hastily unto the young man his armor-bearer, and said
  unto him:</span><quote><span>
   Draw thy sword, and slay me, that the men say not of me, “A woman slew
   him,” and his young man thrust him through, and he died.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>55</verse><span>And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed
  every man unto his place.
  </span><verse>56</verse><span>Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto his
  father, in slaying his seventy brethren;
  </span><verse>57</verse><span>and all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon their heads;
  and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.

  thirty cities, which are called Havoth-Jair unto this day, which are in

  <verse>6</verse><span>And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD, and
  served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of
  Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and
  the gods of the Philistines, and forsook the LORD, and served him not.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into
  the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of the children of
  Ammon.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>And that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel; eighteen
  years, all the children of Israel that were on the other side Jordan in
  the land of the Amorites which is in Gilead.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>Moreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight also against
  Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim; so that
  Israel was sore distressed.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, saying:</span><quote><span>
   We have sinned against thee, both because we have forsaken our God, and
   also served Baalim.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>And the LORD said unto the children of Israel:</span><quote><span>
   Did not I deliver you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the
   children of Ammon, and from the Philistines?
   </span><verse>12</verse><span>The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the
   Maonites, did oppress you; and ye cried to me, and I delivered you out of
   their hand.
   </span><verse>13</verse><span>Yet ye have forsaken me, and served
   other gods; wherefore I will deliver you no more.
   </span><verse>14</verse><span>Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen;
   let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation.
  </span></quote>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And the children of Israel said unto the LORD:</span><quote><span>
   We have sinned; do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee; deliver
   us only, we pray thee, this day.
  </span></quote>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served the
  LORD; and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.

  <verse>17</verse><span>Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped in
  Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled themselves together, and
  encamped in Mizpeh.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>And the people and princes of Gilead said to one another, “What man is
  he that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? He shall be
  head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.”

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor, and he was the
  son of a harlot; and Gilead begat Jephthah.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And Gilead’s wife bare him sons; and his wife’s sons grew up, and they
  thrust out Jephthah, and said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   Thou shalt not inherit in our father’s house; for thou art the son of a
   strange woman.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob; and
  there were gathered vain men to Jephthah, and went out with him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>And it came to pass in process of time, that the children of Ammon made
  war against Israel.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel,
  the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob;
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>and they said unto Jephthah:</span><quote><span>
   Come, and be our captain, that we may fight with the children of Ammon.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead:</span><quote><span>
   Did not ye hate me, and expel me out of my father’s house? And why are ye

  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah:</span><quote><span>
   Therefore we turn again to thee now, that thou mayest go with us, and
   fight against the children of Ammon, and be our head over all the
   inhabitants of Gilead.
  </span></quote>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead:</span><quote><span>
   If ye bring me home again to fight against the children of Ammon, and the
   LORD deliver them before me, shall I be your head?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah:</span><quote><span>
   The LORD be witness between us, if we do not so according to thy words.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him
  head and captain over them; and Jephthah uttered all his words before
  the LORD in Mizpeh.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon,
  saying:</span><quote><span>
   What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come against me to fight in my
   land?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>And the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the messengers of
  Jephthah: Because Israel took away my land, when they came up out of
  Egypt, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and unto Jordan; now therefore
  restore those lands again peaceably.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of
  Ammon;
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>and said unto him:</span><quote>
   <block><span>Thus saith Jephthah, Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land
   of the children of Ammon;
    </span><verse>16</verse><span>but when Israel came
    up from Egypt, and walked through the wilderness unto the Red Sea, and
    came to Kadesh;
    </span><verse>17</verse><span>then Israel sent messengers
    unto the king of Edom, saying, “Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy
    land; but the king of Edom would not hearken thereto.” And in like manner
    they sent unto the king of Moab; but he would not consent; and Israel
    abode in Kadesh.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>18</verse><span>Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the land of
    Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of
    Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, but came not within the
    border of Moab; for Arnon was the border of Moab.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>19</verse><span>And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of
    Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, “Let us pass, we pray thee, through
    thy land into my place.”
    </span><verse>20</verse><span>But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast; but Sihon
    gathered all his people together, and pitched in Jahaz, and fought
    against Israel.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>21</verse><span>And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the
    hand of Israel, and they smote them; so Israel possessed all the land of
    the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.
    </span><verse>22</verse><span>And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon even unto
    Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto Jordan.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>23</verse><span>So now the LORD God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites from
    before his people Israel, and shouldest thou possess it?
    </span><verse>24</verse><span>Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to
    possess? So whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out from before us,
    them will we possess.
    </span><verse>25</verse><span>And now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of
    Moab? Did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against
    them,
    </span><verse>26</verse><span>while Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and her
    towns, and in all the cities that be along by the coasts of Arnon, three
    hundred years? Why therefore did ye not recover them within that
    time?
    </span><verse>27</verse><span>Wherefore I have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong to
    war against me; the LORD the Judge be judge this day between the
    children of Israel and the children of Ammon.</span></block>

  </quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>28</verse><span>Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the words
  of Jephthah which he sent him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>29</verse><span>Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed over
  Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh
  of Gilead he passed over unto the children of Ammon.
  </span><verse>30</verse><span>And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said:</span><quote><span>
   If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into my hands,
   </span><verse>31</verse><span>then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth
   of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the
   children of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD’s, and I will offer it up for
   a burnt offering.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>32</verse><span>So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against
  them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands.
  </span><verse>33</verse><span>And he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith, even
  twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with a very great
  slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children
  of Israel.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>34</verse><span>And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and behold, his daughter
  came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances; and she was his only
  child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.
  </span><verse>35</verse><span>And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and
  said:</span><quote><span>
   Alas, my daughter! Thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them
   that trouble me; for I have opened my mouth unto the LORD, and I cannot go
   back.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>36</verse><span>And she said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth unto the LORD, do to me according
   to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath
   taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies, even of the children of Ammon.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>37</verse><span>And she said unto her father:</span><quote><span>
   Let this thing be done for me; let me alone two months, that I may go up
   and down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>38</verse><span>And he said, “Go.” And he sent her away for two months; and she went
  with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains.
  </span><verse>39</verse><span>And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, who did with her
  according to his vow which he had vowed; and she knew no man.
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  And it was a custom in Israel,
  </span><verse>40</verse><span>that the
  daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the
  Gileadite four days in a year.

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went
  northward, and said unto Jephthah:</span><quote><span>
   Wherefore passedst thou over to fight against the children of Ammon, and

   fire.

  <verse>2</verse><span>And Jephthah said unto them:</span><quote><span>
   I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when

   </span><verse>3</verse><span>And when I saw that ye delivered me not, I put
   my life in my hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and
   the LORD delivered them into my hand; wherefore then are ye come up unto

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with

  Manassites.”
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites;
  and it was so, that when those Ephraimites which were escaped said, “Let
  me go over,” that the men of Gilead said unto him, “Art thou an
  Ephraimite?” If he said, “Nay;”
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>then said they unto him, “Say now Shibboleth;” and he said “Sibbolet;”
  for he could not frame to pronounce it right. Then they took him, and
  slew him at the passages of Jordan; and there fell at that time of the
  Ephraimites forty and two thousand.

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD; and
  the LORD delivered them into the hands of Philistines forty years.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites,
  whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and bare not.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And the angel of the LORD appeared unto the woman, and said unto
  her:</span><quote><span>
   Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not; but thou shalt conceive, and
   bear a son.
   </span><verse>4</verse><span>Now therefore beware, I pray thee,
   and drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing;
   </span><verse>5</verse><span>for, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son;
   and no razor shall come on his head; for the child shall be a Nazarite
   unto God from the womb; and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the
   hand of the Philistines.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>Then the woman came and told her husband, saying:</span><quote><span>
   A man of God came unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of
   an angel of God, very terrible; but I asked him not whence he was, neither
   told he me his name;
   </span><verse>7</verse><span>but he said unto me,
   behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor
   strong drink, neither eat any unclean thing; for the child shall be a
   Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his death.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>Then Manoah entreated the LORD, and said:</span><quote><span>
   O my Lord, let the man of God which thou didst send come again unto us,

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came

  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And the woman made hast, and ran, and showed her husband, and said unto
  him, “Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto me the other
  day.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and
  said unto him, “Art thou the man that spakest unto the woman?” And he
  said, “I am.”
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And Manoah said, “Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we order
  the child, and how shall we do unto him?”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah:</span><quote><span>
   Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware.
   </span><verse>14</verse><span>She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the
   vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean
   thing; all that I commanded her let her observe.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD:</span><quote><span>
   I pray thee, Let us detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for
   thee.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah:</span><quote><span>
   Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread; and if thou wilt offer
   a burnt offering, thou must offer it unto the LORD.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  For Manoah knew not that he was an angel of the LORD.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD:
  </span><quote><span>
   What is thy name, that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honor?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>And the angel of the LORD said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   Why askest thou thus after my name, seeing it is secret?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered it upon a rock
  unto the LORD; and the angel did wondrously; and Manoah and his wife
  looked on.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the
  altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar;
  and Manoah and his wife looked on it, and fell on their faces to the
  ground.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to his
  wife.
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>And Manoah said unto his wife:</span><quote><span>
   We shall surely
   die, because we have seen God.</span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>But his wife said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt
   offering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would he have showed us
   all these things, nor would as at this time have told us such things as
   these.

  Samson’s marriage

 <chapter>14
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the
  daughters of the Philistines.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, “I have
  seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines; now
  therefore get her for me to wife.”
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>Then his father and his mother said unto him, “Is there never a woman
  among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou
  goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines?” And Samson said
  unto his father, “Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well.”
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the LORD, that he
  sought an occasion against the Philistines; for at that time the
  Philistines had dominion over Israel.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath, and
  came to the vineyards of Timnath; and, behold, a young lion roared
  against him.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he rent him as
  he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his hand; but he told
  not his father or his mother what he had done.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson
  well.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see
  the carcass of the lion; and, behold, there was a swarm of bees and
  honey in the carcass of the lion.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his
  father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat; but he told not
  them that he had taken the honey out of the carcass of the lion.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>So his father went down unto the woman; and Samson made there a feast;
  for so used the young men to do.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty
  companions to be with him.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And Samson said unto them:</span><quote><span>
   I will now put forth a riddle unto you; if ye can certainly declare it me
   within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you
   thirty sheets and thirty change of garments;
   </span><verse>13</verse><span>but if ye cannot declare it me, then shall ye
   give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And they said unto him, “Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it.”
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And he said unto them, “Out of the eater came
  forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness.” And they could
  not in three days expound the riddle.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson’s
  wife:</span><quote><span>
   Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn
   thee and thy father’s house with fire; have ye called us to take that we
   have? Is it not so?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>And Samson’s wife wept before him, and said:</span><quote><span>
   Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not; thou hast put forth a riddle
   unto the children of my people, and hast not told it me.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And he said unto her:
  </span><quote><span>
   Behold, I have not told it my father nor my mother, and shall I tell it
   thee?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted; and
  it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she lay
  sore upon him; and she told the riddle to the children of her people.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun
  went down:</span><quote><span>
   What is sweeter than honey? And what is stronger than a lion?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And he said unto them:
  </span><quote><span>
   If ye had not ploughed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle.

  <verse>19</verse><span>And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon,

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat harvest,
  that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, “I will go in to
  my wife into the chamber.” But her father would not suffer him to go in.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And her father said:</span><quote><span>
   I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her
   to thy companion; is not her younger sister fairer than she? Take her, I
   pray thee, instead of her.
  </span></quote>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>And Samson said concerning them:</span><quote><span>
   Now shall I be more blameless than the Philistines, though I do them a

  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands,
  and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst between two
  tails.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the
  standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks, and also
  the standing corn, with the vineyards and olives.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>Then the Philistines said, “Who hath done this?” And they answered,
  “Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife,
  and given her to his companion.”
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And Samson said unto them, “Though ye have done
  this, yet will I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.”
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>And he smote them hip and thigh with a great
  slaughter; and he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread
  themselves in Lehi.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And
  the men of Judah said, “Why are ye come up against us?” And they answered,
  “To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he hath done to us.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam, and
  said to Samson, “Knowest thou not that the Philistines are rulers over
  us? What is this that thou hast done unto us?” And he said unto them,
  “As they did unto me, so have I done unto them.”
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And they said unto him, “We are come down to bind thee, that we may
  deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines.” And Samson said unto
  them, “Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.”
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And they spake unto him, saying, “No; but we will bind thee fast, and
  deliver thee into their hand; but surely we will not kill thee.”
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the rock.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And when he came into Lehi, the Philistines
  shouted against him; and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him,
  and the cords that were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with
  fire, and his bands loosed from off his hands.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put
  forth his hand, and took it, and slew a thousand men therewith.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And Samson said, “With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the
  jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast
  away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that place Ramathlehi.

   Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant; and
   now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?

 <chapter>19

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel,
  that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side of mount Ephraim,
  who took to him a concubine out of Beth-Lehem-Judah.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And his concubine played the whore against him, and went away from him
  unto her father’s house to Beth-Lehem-Judah, and was there four whole
  months.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly unto her,
  and to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple of
  asses; and she brought him into her father’s house; and when the father
  of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And his father-in-law, the damsel’s father, retained him; and he abode
  with him three days; so they did eat and drink, and lodged there.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early in the

   Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward go your way.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And they sat down and did eat and drink both of them together; for the

   Comfort thine heart, I pray thee.

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his

   Behold, now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you tarry all night;
   behold, the day groweth to an end, lodge here, that thine heart may be
   merry; and tomorrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home.

  <verse>10</verse><span>But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed,

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>And he said unto his servant:</span><quote><span>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them

  <verse>16</verse><span>And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>And he said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   We are passing from Beth-Lehem-Judah toward the side of mount Ephraim;

   the house of the LORD; and there is no man that receiveth me to house.
   </span><verse>19</verse><span>Yet there is both straw and provender for our

  Israel gave place to the Benjamites, because they trusted unto the liers
  in wait which they had set beside Gibeah.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>37</verse><span>And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the liers in
  wait drew themselves along, and smote all the city with the edge of the
  sword.
  </span><verse>38</verse><span>Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers
  in wait, that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of
  the city.
  </span><verse>39</verse><span>And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin began to
  smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons; for they said,
  “Surely they are smitten down before us, as in the first battle.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>40</verse><span>But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of
  smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and behold, the flame of the
  city ascended up to heaven.
  </span><verse>41</verse><span>And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin were
  amazed; for they saw that evil was come upon them.
  </span><verse>42</verse><span>Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto the way
  of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and them which came out
  of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them.
  </span><verse>43</verse><span>Thus they inclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased them, and
  trode them down with ease over against Gibeah, toward the sun-rising.
  </span><verse>44</verse><span>And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were men of
  valor.
  </span><verse>45</verse><span>And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon;
  and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; and pursued
  hard after them unto Gidom, and slew two thousand men of them.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>46</verse><span>So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five
  thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of valor.
  </span><verse>47</verse><span>But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the rock of
  Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months.
  </span><verse>48</verse><span>And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin, and
  smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the men of every city, as
  the beast, and all that came to hand; also they set on fire all the
  cities that they came to.

  <verse>1</verse><span>Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying:</span><quote><span>
   There shall not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife.

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>And the people came to the house of God, and abode there till even

   O LORD God of Israel, why is this come to pass in Israel, that there

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and

  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And the children of Israel said:</span><quote><span>
   Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that came not up with the
   congregation unto the LORD?
  </span></quote>

 <block><span>
  For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to the LORD
  to Mizpeh, saying, “He shall surely be put to death.”
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And the children of Israel repented them for
  Benjamin their brother, and said:
  </span><quote><span>
   There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.
   </span><verse>7</verse><span>How shall we do for wives for them that remain,

 <block><span>
  And, behold, there came none to the camp from Jabesh-Gilead to the
  assembly.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>For the people were numbered, and,
  behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead there.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And the congregation sent thither twelve
  thousand men of the valiantest, and commanded them, saying:
  </span><quote><span>
   Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead with the edge of the sword,
   with the women and the children.
   </span><verse>11</verse><span>And this is
   the thing that ye shall do, ye shall utterly destroy every male, and every
   woman that hath lain by man.

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead four hundred
  young virgins, that had known no man by lying with any male; and they
  brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of
  Canaan.

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>And the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children of
  Benjamin that were in the rock Rimmon, and to call peaceably unto them.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives which
  they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh- Gilead; and yet so they
  sufficed them not.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the LORD had
  made a breach in the tribes of Israel.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>Then the elders of the congregation said:</span><quote><span>
   How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are
   destroyed out of Benjamin?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>And they said:</span><quote><span>
   There must be an inheritance for them that be escaped of Benjamin, that a
   tribe be not destroyed out of Israel.
   </span><verse>18</verse><span>Howbeit
   we may not give them wives of our daughters; for the children of Israel
   have sworn, saying, “Cursed be he that giveth a wife to Benjamin.”

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>Then they said:</span><quote><span>
   Behold, there is a feast of the LORD in Shiloh yearly, in a place which is

   from Beth-El to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.

  <verse>20</verse><span>Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying:</span><quote><span>
   Go and lie in wait in the vineyards;
   </span><verse>21</verse><span>and see,
   and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then
   come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the
   daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.
   </span><verse>22</verse><span>And it shall be, when their fathers or their
   brethren come unto us to complain, that we will say unto them, “Be
   favorable unto them for our sakes; because we reserved not to each man his
   wife in the war; for ye did not give unto them at this time, that ye
   should be guilty.”
  </span></quote>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives, according to
  their number, of them that danced, whom they caught; and they went and
  returned unto their inheritance, and repaired the cities, and dwelt in
  them.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to
  his tribe and to his family, and they went out from thence every man to
  his inheritance.
