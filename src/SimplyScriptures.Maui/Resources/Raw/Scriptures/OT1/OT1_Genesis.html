   And it came to pass, that the Lord spake unto Moses, saying:
  </span></dunder>
  <quote>
   <dunder><span>Behold, I reveal unto you concerning this heaven and this earth; write
   the words which I speak. I am the Beginning and the End; the Almighty God. By mine Only
   Begotten I created these things.</span></dunder>
   <verse>1</verse><span>Yea, in
   the beginning I created the heaven, and the earth
   </span><dunder><span>upon which thou standest</span></dunder><span>.
   </span><verse>2</verse><span>And the earth was
   without form, and void; and
   </span><dunder><span>I caused</span></dunder><span>
   darkness to come up upon the
   face of the deep. And my Spirit moved upon the face of the waters, for I
   am God.

  Day 1: Light
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>And I, God, said, “Let there be light,” and
  there was light.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And I, God, saw the light, and
  that light was good. And I, God, divided the light from the darkness.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And I, God, called the light day, and the
  darkness I called night.
  </span><dunder><span>And this I did by the word of my power; and it was done as I spake</span></dunder><span>. And the evening and the morning
  were the first day.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  Day 2: Waters
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And again, I, God, said, “Let there be a
  firmament in the midst of the waters;” and
  </span><dunder><span>it was so, even as I spake. And I said,</span></dunder><span>
  “Let it divide the waters from the
  waters;”
  </span><dunder><span>and it was done</span></dunder><span>.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And I, God,
  made the firmament, and divided the waters; yea, the great waters under
  the firmament, from the waters which were above the firmament; and it was
  so,
  </span><dunder><span>even as I spake</span></dunder><span>.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>And I,
  God, called the firmament heaven. And the evening and the morning were the
  second day.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  Day 3: Land and plants
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>And I, God, said, “Let the waters under the
  heaven be gathered together unto one place;” and
  </span><dunder><span>it was so. And I, God, said</span></dunder><span>, “Let there be dry land; and it was so.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And I, God, called the dry land earth; and the
  gathering together of the waters called I the sea. And I, God, saw that
  all things which I had made were good.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>And I, God, said, “Let the earth bring forth
  grass; the herb yielding seed; the fruit tree yielding fruit after his
  kind; and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed should be in itself, upon
  the earth;” and it was so,
  </span><dunder><span>even as I spake</span></dunder><span>.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And the earth brought forth grass; every herb
  yielding seed after his kind; and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed
  should be in itself, after his kind. And I, God, saw that all things which
  I had made were good.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And the evening and the
  morning were the third day.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  Day 4: Lights
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>And I, God, said, “Let there be lights in the
  firmament of the heaven, to divide the day from the night; and let them be
  for signs and for seasons, and for days and for years,
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>and let them be for lights in the firmament of
  the heaven, to give light upon the earth;” and it was so.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And I, God, made two great lights; the greater
  light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night;
  </span><dunder><span>and the greater light was the sun, and the lesser light was the moon</span></dunder><span>. And the stars also were made,
  </span><dunder><span>even according to my word</span></dunder><span>.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And I, God, set them in the firmament of the
  heaven, to give light upon the earth;
  </span><verse>18</verse><dunder><span>and the sun</span></dunder><span>
  to rule over the day, and
  </span><dunder><span>the moon to rule</span></dunder><span>
  over
  the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. And I, God, saw that all things which I had made were good.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And the evening and the morning were the fourth
  day.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  Day 5: Creatures of water and air
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>And I, God, said, “Let the waters bring forth abundantly, the moving
  creature that hath life, and fowl which may fly above the earth, in the
  open firmament of heaven.”
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>And I, God, created great whales, and every living creature that
  moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind; and
  every winged fowl, after his kind. And I, God, saw that all things which
  I had created were good;
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>and I, God, blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill
  the waters in the sea, and let fowl multiply in the earth.”
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  Day 6: Beasts of earth, man
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>And I, God, said, “Let the earth bring forth the living creature, after
  his kind; cattle and creeping things, and beasts of the earth, after
  their kind,” and it was so.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>And I, God, made the beasts of the earth, after their kind; and cattle
  after their kind; and everything which creepeth upon the earth, after
  his kind. And I, God, saw that all these things were good.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>26</verse><span>And I, God, said
  </span><dunder><span>unto mine Only Begotten, which was with me from the beginning</span></dunder><span>:
  </span><quote><span>Let
  us make man in our image, after our likeness.</span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And
  </span><dunder><span>it was so. And I, God, said</span></dunder><span>:
  </span><quote><span>
   Let them have dominion over the fishes of the sea, and over the fowl of
   the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every
   creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>27</verse><span>And I, God, created man in mine own image, in
  the image of
  </span><under><note><span>God</span></note><span>mine Only Begotten</span></under><span>
  created I him; male and female
  created I them.
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>And I, God, blessed them and
  said unto them:
  </span><quote><span>
   Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and
   have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and
   over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>29</verse><span>And I, God, said unto man:</span><quote><span>
   Behold, I have given you every herb, bearing seed, which is upon the face
   of all the earth; and every tree in the which shall be the fruit of a
   tree, yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
   </span><verse>30</verse><span>And to every beast of the earth, and to every
   fowl of the air, and to everything that creepeth upon the earth, wherein I
   grant life, there shall be given every clean herb for meat.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And it was so,
  </span><dunder><span>even as I spake</span></dunder><span>.
  </span><verse>31</verse><span>And I,
  God, saw everything that I had made, and behold, all things which I had
  made were very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.

  Day 7: Rest
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>2
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Thus the heaven and the earth were finished, and
  all the host of them.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And on the seventh day, I,
  God, ended my work, and all things which I had made; and I rested on the
  seventh day from all my work; and all things which I had made were
  finished.
  </span><dunder><span>And I, God, saw that they were good</span></dunder><span>.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And I, God, blessed the seventh day, and
  sanctified it, because that in it I had rested from all my work, which I,
  God, had created and made.

  THE GARDEN OF EDEN
 </span></blockheading>
 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>And now, behold, I say unto you, that these are
  the generations of the heaven, and of the earth, when they were created in
  the day that I the LORD God made the heaven and the earth,
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>and every plant of the field before it was in
  the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew;
  </span><dunder><span>for I, the Lord God, created all things of which I have spoken
  spiritually, before they were naturally upon the face of the earth</span></dunder><span>; for I, the
  LORD God, had not caused it to rain upon the face of the earth.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  The first flesh
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <dunder><span>And I, the Lord God, had created all the children of men</span></dunder><span>, and not
  yet a man to till the ground,
  </span><dunder><span>for in heaven created I them, and there was not yet flesh upon the
  earth, neither in the water, neither in the air</span></dunder><span>;
  </span><dunder><span>but I, the Lord God, spake</span></dunder><span>,
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>and there
  went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>And I, the LORD God, formed man from the dust of
  the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man
  became a living soul;
  </span><dunder><span>the first flesh upon the earth, the first man also; nevertheless, all things were before created, but
  spiritually were they created and made, according to my word.</span></dunder>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>And I, the LORD God, planted a garden eastward
  in Eden; and there I put the man whom I had formed.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>And out of the ground, made I, the LORD God, to
  grow every tree naturally, that is pleasant to the sight of man</span><dunder><span>, and man could behold it, and it became also</span></dunder><span>
  a
  </span><dunder><span>living soul; for it was spiritual in the day that I created it; for it
  remaineth in the sphere in which I, God, created it; yea, even all things which I prepared for
  the use of man; and man saw that</span></dunder><span>
  it was good for food.
  </span><dunder><span>And I, the Lord God, planted</span></dunder><span>
  the tree of life also, in the midst of
  the garden; and also the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>And I, the LORD God, caused a river to go out of Eden, to water the
  garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And I, the LORD God, called the name of the first Pison, and it
  compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where I, the LORD, created much
  gold;
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>and the gold of that land was good, and there was bdellium, and the
  onyx stone.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And the name of the second river was called Gihon, the same that
  compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And the name of the third river was Hiddekel, that which goeth toward
  the east of Assyria. And the fourth river was Euphrates.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And I, the LORD God, took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden,
  to dress it, and to keep it.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And I, the LORD God, commanded the man, saying:</span><quote><span>
   Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat;
   </span><verse>17</verse><span>but of the tree of the knowledge of good and
   evil, thou shalt not eat of it;
   </span><dunder><span>nevertheless, thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is given unto thee; but remember that I forbid i</span></dunder><span>t; for in
   the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>And I, the LORD God, said
  </span><dunder><span>unto mine Only Begotten</span></dunder><span>, that it was not good that the man should
  be alone;
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>wherefore, I will make an help meet
  for him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>And out of the ground, I the LORD God, formed
  every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and commanded that
  they should come unto Adam, to see what he would call them. And
  </span><dunder><span>they were also living souls; for I, God, breathed into them the breath
  of life, and commanded tha</span></dunder><span>t whatsoever Adam called every living
  creature, that should be the name thereof.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And
  Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every
  beast of the field; but as for Adam, there was not found an help meet for
  him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>And I, the LORD God, caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he
  slept, and I took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in the stead
  thereof;
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>and the rib, which I, the LORD God had taken from man, made I a woman,
  and brought her unto the man.
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>And Adam said:</span><quote><span>
   This I know now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. She shall be
   called woman, because she was taken out of man.
   </span><verse>24</verse><span>Therefore shall a man leave his father and his
   mother, and shall cleave unto his wife; and they shall be one flesh.

 <block>
  <verse>25</verse><span>And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not
  ashamed.

  Satan’s backstory

 <chapter>3
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <dunder><span>
   And I, the Lord God, spake unto Moses, saying:
   </span><quote><span>
    That Satan whom thou hast commanded in the name of mine Only Begotten, is
    the same which was from the beginning; and he came
    before me, saying, “Behold I, send me, I will be
    thy Son, and I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be
    lost, and surely I will do it; wherefore, give me
    thine honor.”
   </span></quote>
   <quote><span>
    But behold, my beloved Son, which was my beloved and chosen from the
    beginning, said unto me, “Father, thy will be done,
    and the glory be thine forever.”
   </span></quote>
   <quote><span>
    Wherefore, because that Satan rebelled against me, and sought to destroy
    the agency of man, which I, the Lord God, had given
    him; and also that I should give unto him mine own
    power; by the power of mine Only Begotten I caused that he should be cast down; and he became Satan. Yea, even the devil, the father of all
    lies, to deceive, and to blind men, and to lead
    them captive at his will, even as many as would not hearken unto my voice.

  <verse>1</verse><span>And now, the serpent was more subtle than any
  beast of the field, which I, the LORD God, had made.
  </span><dunder><span>And Satan put it into the heart of the serpent, for he had drawn
  away many after him; and he sought also to beguile Eve, for he knew not the
  mind of God</span></dunder><span>;
  </span><dunder><span>wherefore, he sought to destroy the world</span></dunder><span>.
 </span></block>

 <block><span>And he said unto the woman:</span><quote><span>
   Yea, hath God said, “Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden”?
  </span></quote>

 <block><span>
  And he
  </span><dunder><span>spake</span></dunder><span>
  by the mouth of the serpent.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And the woman said unto the serpent:
  </span><quote><span>
   We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden;
   </span><verse>3</verse><span>but of the fruit of the tree which thou
   beholdest in the midst of the garden, God hath said, “Ye shall not eat of
   it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.”

 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>And the serpent said unto the woman:</span><quote><span>
   Ye shall not surely die;

   in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be
   as gods, knowing good and evil.

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And when the woman saw that the tree was good
  for food, and that it became pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be
  desired to make her wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat; and
  gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And the eyes of them both were opened, and they
  knew that they had been naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and
  made themselves aprons.

  <verse>24</verse><span>So I drove out the man, and I placed at the east of the garden of Eden,

  </span><dunder><span>
   (And these are the words which I spake unto my servant Moses. And they are

   And it came to pass, that after I, the Lord God, had driven them out, that
   Adam began to till the earth, and to have dominion
   over all the beasts of the field, and to eat his bread by the sweat of his brow, as I, the Lord had commanded him, and Eve also,
   his wife, did labor with him. And Adam knew his
   wife, and she bare unto him sons and daughters, and they began to multiply, and to replenish the earth. And from that time
   forth, the sons and daughters of Adam began to
   divide, two and two, in the land, and to till the land, and to tend flocks; and they also begat sons and daughters.</span></dunder>

   And Adam called upon the name of the Lord, and Eve also, his wife; and
   they heard the voice of the Lord, from the way
   towards the garden of Eden, speaking unto them, and they saw him not; for they were shut out from his presence. And he gave
   unto them commandments, that they should worship
   the Lord their God; and should offer the firstlings
   of their flocks for an offering unto the Lord. And Adam was obedient unto
   the commandments of the Lord.

    This thing is a similitude of the sacrifice of the Only Begotten of the

   Swear unto me by thy throat, and if thou tell it thou shalt die; and swear
   thy brethren by their heads, and by the living God, that they tell it not;

 <block>
  <dunder><span>
   For, Lamech having entered into a covenant with Satan, after the manner of
   Cain, wherein he became Master Mahan, master of
   that great secret which was administered unto Cain
   by Satan; and Irad, the son of Enoch, having known their secret, began
   to reveal it unto the sons of Adam; wherefore,
   Lamech, being angry, slew him, not like unto Cain
   his brother Abel for the sake of getting gain; but he slew him for the
   oath’s sake; for, from the days of Cain, there was
   a secret combination, and their works were in the dark, and they knew every man his brother.</span></dunder>

 <block>
  <dunder><span>
   Wherefore the Lord cursed Lamech and his house, and all they that had
   covenanted with Satan; for they kept not the

   spread among all the sons of men. And it was among
   the sons of men.</span></dunder>

 <block>
  <dunder><span>
   And among the daughters of men, these things were not spoken; because that
   Lamech had spoken the secret unto his wives, and
   they rebelled against him, and declared these things abroad, and had not compassion. Wherefore Lamech was despised, and cast
   out, and came not among the sons of men, lest he
   should die.</span></dunder>

  <dunder><span>
   And thus the works of darkness began to prevail among all the sons of men.
   And God cursed the earth with a sore curse, and was
   angry with the wicked, with all the sons of men
   whom he had made, for they would not hearken unto his voice, nor believe
   on his Only Begotten Son, even him whom he declared
   should come in the meridian of time; who was
   prepared from before the foundation of the world.</span></dunder>

  <dunder><span>And thus the gospel began to be preached from the beginning, being
  declared by holy angels, sent forth from the presence of God; and

  and the gospel preached; and a decree sent forth
  that it should be in the world until the end thereof; and thus it was. Amen.</span></dunder>

    <block><span>And the Lord said unto Adam, “Behold, I have forgiven thee thy
    transgression in the garden of Eden.”</span></block>

    <block><span>Hence came the saying abroad among the people, that the Son of God hath
    atoned for original guilt, wherein the sins of the
    parents cannot be answered upon the heads of the
    children, for they are whole from the foundation of the world.</span></block>

    <block><span>And the Lord spake unto Adam, saying:
     </span><quote>
      <block><span>Inasmuch as thy children are conceived in sin, even so, when they begin to
      grow up sin conceiveth in their hearts, and they
      taste the bitter, that they may know to prize the
      good. And it is given unto them to know good from evil; wherefore, they are agents unto themselves.</span></block>

      <block><span>And I have given unto you another law and commandment; wherefore teach
      it unto your children, that all men, everywhere,
      must repent, or they can in no wise inherit the
      kingdom of God. For no unclean thing can dwell there, or dwell in his presence; for, in the language of Adam, Man of Holiness is his name; and
      the name of his Only Begotten is the son of Man,
      even Jesus Christ, a righteous judge, who shall
      come in the meridian of time. Therefore I give unto you a commandment, to teach these things freely unto
      your children, saying, that by reason of
      transgression cometh the fall, which fall bringeth death; and inasmuch as ye were born into the world by water and blood, and the spirit, which
      I have made, and so become of dust a living soul;
      even so ye must be born again, into the kingdom of
      heaven, of water, and of the Spirit, and be cleansed by blood, even the blood of mine Only Begotten; that ye may be sanctified from all sin;
      and enjoy the words of eternal life in this world,
      and eternal life in the world to come; even
      immortal glory.
      </span></block>

      <block><span>For, by the water ye keep the commandment; by the Spirit ye are justified;
      and by the blood ye are sanctified. Therefore it is
      given to abide in you, the record of heaven, the
      Comforter, the peaceable things of immortal glory, the truth of all things, that which quickeneth all things which maketh alive all things, that which
      knoweth all things, and hath all power according to wisdom, mercy, truth,
      justice and judgment.</span></block>

      <block><span>And now, behold, I say unto you, this is the plan of salvation unto all
      men, through the blood of mine Only Begotten, who
      shall come in the meridian of time. And, behold,
      all things have their likeness; and all things are created and made to bear record of me; both things which are temporal, and things
      which are spiritual; things which are in the
      heavens above, and things which are on the earth,
      and things which are in the earth, and things which are under the
      earth, both above and beneath, all things bear
      record of me.</span></block>

   <block><span>As I was journeying, and stood in the place Mahujah, and cried unto the
   Lord, there came a voice out of heaven, saying,
   “Turn ye and get ye upon the mount Simeon.” And it
   came to pass, that I turned and went up on the mount; and as I stood upon
   the mount, I beheld the heavens open, and I was
   clothed upon with glory. And I saw the Lord, and he
   stood before my face, and he talked with me, even as a man talketh one with another, face to face; and he said unto
   me, “Look, and I will show unto thee the world for
   the space of many generations.” And it came to pass, that I beheld in
   the valley of Shum, and, lo! A great people which
   dwelt in tents, which were the people of Shum. And
   again the Lord said unto me, “Look;” and I looked towards the north, and I beheld the people of Cainan, which dwelt in tents.</span></block>

   <block><span>And the Lord said unto me, “Prophesy;” and I prophesied saying:
    </span><quote><span>Behold, the people of Cainan which are numerous, shall go forth in battle
    array against the people of Shum, and shall slay
    them, that they shall be utterly destroyed. And the
    people of Cainan shall divide themselves in the land, and the land shall be barren and unfruitful, and none other people shall dwell
    there, but the people of Cainan; for, behold, the

   unto me, “Go forth to this people, and say unto
   them, ‘Repent;’ lest I come out and smite them with a curse, and they
   die.”</span></block>

   <block><span>And he gave unto me a commandment, that I should baptize in the name of

   so great was the faith of Enoch, that he led the people of God, and their enemies came to battle against them, and he spake the word
   of the Lord, and the earth trembled, and the
   mountains fled, even according to his command. And the rivers of water were turned out of their course, and the roar of the
   lions was heard out of the wilderness. And all
   nations feared greatly, so powerful was the word of Enoch, and so great was the power of the language which God had given him.

   There also came up a land out of the depths of the sea; and so great was

   they fled and stood afar off, and went upon the land which came up out of the depths of the sea. And the giants of the land
   also stood afar off; and there went forth a curse
   upon all the people which fought against God. And from that time forth, there were wars, and bloodshed among them; but the Lord came

    gave commandment, that they should love one

    in the floods upon them; for my fierce anger is kindled against them.

    Behold, I am God; Man of Holiness is my name; Man of Counsel is my name;

    wickedness as among thy brethren; but, behold,
    their sins shall be upon the heads of their fathers; Satan shall be their father, and misery shall be their doom; and the
    whole heavens shall weep over them, even all the
    workmanship of my hands. Wherefore should not the
    heavens weep, seeing these shall suffer? But, behold, these which thine eyes are upon shall
    perish in the floods; and, behold, I will shut them up; a prison have I prepared for them, and he whom I have chosen
    hath pleaded before my face; wherefore he suffereth
    for their sins, inasmuch as they will repent, in the day that my chosen shall return unto me; and until that day they shall be in torment.

  dwelt there in the plain of Shinar.

   this tower they begin to build, and now, nothing will be restrained from
   them, which they have imagined,
   </span><verse>7</verse><span>except I, the

  <verse>1</verse><span>Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, bare him no children. And she had a handmaid,
  an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And Sarai said unto Abram, “Behold, now, the LORD hath restrained me
  from bearing; I pray thee go in unto my maid; it may be that I may
  obtain children by her.”

  And Abram hearkened unto the voice of Sarai.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And
  Sarai, Abram’s wife, took Hagar her maid, the Egyptian, after Abram had
  dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband, Abram,
  to be his wife.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And he went in unto Hagar, and
  she conceived; and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was
  despised in her eyes.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And Sarai said unto Abram,
  “My wrong is upon thee; I have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she
  saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes; the LORD judge
  between me and thee.”
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>But Abram said unto Sarai,
  “Behold, thy maid is in thy hands; do to her as it pleaseth thee.”

  And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face.

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>And he said, “Hagar, Sarai’s maid, whence comest thou, and whither wilt
  thou go?” And she said, “I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.”
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>And the angel of the LORD said unto her, “Return to thy mistress, and
  submit thyself unto her hands.”

  <verse>11</verse><span>And the angel of the LORD said unto her:</span><quote><span>
   Behold, thou art with child, and shalt bear a son, and shall call his name

   </span><verse>12</verse><span>And he will be a wild man; and his hand will be
   against every man, and every man’s hand against him; and he shall dwell in
   the presence of all his brethren.

  <verse>13</verse><span>And she called the name

   <block><span>My people have gone astray from my precepts, and have not kept mine

    eight years old.</span></dunder>
   </block>

   <block><span>And thou shalt observe to keep all my covenants wherein I covenanted with

   <block>

   covenant which ye shall keep between me and thee and thy seed after thee;
   every man-child among you shall be circumcised.
   </span><verse>11</verse><span>And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your
   foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.
   </span><verse>12</verse><span>And he that is eight days old shall be
   circumcised among you, every man-child in your generations; he that is
   born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of
   thy seed.
   </span><verse>13</verse><span>He that is born in thy house, and he
   that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised, and my covenant
   shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
   </span><verse>14</verse><span>And the uncircumcised man-child, whose flesh of
   his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his
   people, he hath broken my covenant.

  Abimelech, king of Gerar, sent and took Sarah.

  the city, by a well of water, at evening, the time that women go out to
  draw water.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And he said:

   <block><span>O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee this day, that thou wouldst
   show kindness unto my master Abraham, and send me good speed.
    </span><verse>13</verse><span>Behold, I stand by the well of water, and the
    daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water;</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>14</verse><span>And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, “Let down
    thy pitcher I pray thee, that I may drink;” and she shall say, “Drink,

    hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou

  <verse>15</verse><span>And it came to pass, before he had done
  speaking, that behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Beth-El, son of
  Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother, with her pitcher upon her
  shoulder.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And the damsel being a virgin, very

  </span><dunder><span>such as the servant of Abraham had not seen,</span></dunder><span>
  neither had any man known

  <verse>17</verse><span>And the servant ran to meet her, and said, “Let me, I pray thee, drink
  a little water of thy pitcher.”
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>And she said, “Drink, my lord.” And she hasted and let down her pitcher
  upon her hand, and gave him drink.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And when she had done giving him drink, she said, “I will draw for thy
  camels also, until they have done drinking.”
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again
  unto the well to draw, and drew for all his camels.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>And the man, wondering at her, held his peace, pondering in his heart
  whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not.

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took
  a gold earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands

 <block>
  <verse>28</verse><span>And the damsel ran to the house, and told her mother these things.
  </span><verse>29</verse><span>And Rebekah had a brother, whose name was Laban; and Laban ran out to
  the man, unto the well.
  </span><verse>30</verse><span>And it came to pass when he saw the earrings, and bracelets upon his

  saying, “Thus spake the man unto me, and I came unto the man, and
  behold, he stood by the camels at the well.”
  </span><verse>31</verse><span>And he said, “Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore standest
  thou without? For I have prepared the house, and room for the
  camels.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>32</verse><span>And the man came into the house. And he unburdened his camels, and gave
  straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the
  men’s feet that came with
  him.
  </span><verse>33</verse><span>And there was set before him food to eat;
  but he said, “I will not eat until I have told mine errand.” And Laban

    my master’s wife, bare a son to my master when she was old; and unto him

    daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell;
    </span><verse>38</verse><span>but thou shalt go unto my father’s house, and
    to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son.”
    </span><verse>39</verse><span>And I said unto my master, “Perhaps the woman
    will not follow me.”
    </span><verse>40</verse><span>And he said unto me, “The

    prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son, of my kindred, and
    of my father’s house;
    </span><verse>41</verse><span>then shalt thou be clear

   <block>
    <verse>42</verse><span>And I came this day unto the well, and said, “O LORD God of my master

    said, “Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also;” so I drank, and
    she made the camels drink also.
    </span><verse>47</verse><span>And I asked her and said, “Whose daughter art thou?” And she said, “The

   Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of.
   </span><verse>3</verse><span>Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee,
   and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all

   as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries;

  <verse>6</verse><span>And Isaac dwelt in Gerar.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And the men of the place asked him concerning his wife; and he said,
  “She is my sister;” for he feared to say, “She in my wife;” lest, the
  men of the place should kill him for to get Rebekah; because she was
  fair to look upon.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech
  looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with
  Rebekah his wife.

  <verse>9</verse><span>And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, “Behold, of a surety Rebekah is
  thy wife; and how saidst thou she is thy sister?” And Isaac said unto

  brought guiltiness upon us.”

  very great;
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>for he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him and said:
  The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother
  Esau’s hands; so he blessed him.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>And he said, “Art thou my very son Esau?” And he said, “I am.”
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>And
  he said, “Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son’s venison, that my

 <block><span>
  And he brought it near to him, and he did eat; and he brought him wine,

  him, “Come near now, and kiss me, my son.”
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>And
  he came near, and kissed him; and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and
  blessed him, and said:
  </span><quote><span>
   See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath
   blessed;
   </span><verse>28</verse><span>therefore God give thee of the dew of
   heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine;
   </span><verse>29</verse><span>let people serve thee, and nations bow down to

  <verse>30</verse><span>And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing

  <verse>41</verse><span>And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father

  <verse>10</verse><span>And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.

   I am the LORD God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac; the land

  <verse>1</verse><span>Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of
  the east.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there were
  three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the
  flocks; and a great stone was upon the well’s mouth.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And thither were all the flocks gathered; and they rolled the stone
  from the well’s mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again
  upon the well’s mouth in his place.

  And they said, “He is well; and, behold, Rachel, his daughter cometh with
  the sheep.”
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And he said, “Lo, it is yet high
  day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together; water

  </span><verse>8</verse><span>And they
  said, “We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and till they
  roll the stone from the well’s mouth; then we water the sheep.”

  Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered
  the flock of Laban his mother’s brother.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.

  <verse>4</verse><span>And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand,

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>So Jacob came to Luz which is in the land of Canaan, that is, Beth-El,

  <verse>16</verse><span>And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way to come

 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of
  Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of
  Zibeon the Hivite;
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>and Bashemath Ishmael’s daughter, sister of Nebajoth.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel;

  <verse>6</verse><span>And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the
  persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his
  substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into the
  country from the face of his brother Jacob.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>For their riches were more than that they might dwell together; and the
  land wherin they were strangers could not bear them because of their
  cattle.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir; Esau is Edom.
 </span></block>

  <verse>9</verse><span>And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in

 <heading><span>
  Joseph
 </span></heading>

 <block><span>
  Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his
  brethren; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of
  Zilpah, his father’s wives; and Joseph brought unto his father their evil
  report.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>Now Israel loved Joseph more than all
  his children, because he was the son of his old age; and he made him a
  coat of many colors.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his
  brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren; and they hated
  him yet the more.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And he said unto them:</span><quote><span>
   Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed.
   </span><verse>7</verse><span>For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the
   field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your
   sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>And his brethren said to him:</span><quote><span>
   Shalt thou indeed reign over us? Or shalt thou indeed have dominion over
   us?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and
  said:</span><quote><span>
   Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and behold, the sun and the moon and
   the eleven stars made obeisance to me.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>And he told it to his father, and to his brethren; and his father
  rebuked him, and said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy
   brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>And his brethren went to feed their father’s flock in Shechem.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And Israel said unto Joseph, “Do not thy brethren feed the flock in
  Shechem? Come, and I will send thee unto them.” And he said to him,
  “Here am I.”
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And he said to him:</span><quote><span>
   Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with
   the flocks; and bring me word again.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>And a certain man found him, and, behold, he
  was wandering in the field; and the man asked him, saying, “What seekest
  thou?”
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And he said, “I seek my brethren; tell
  me, I pray thee, where they feed their flocks.”
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And the man said, “They are departed hence; for
  I heard them say, ‘Let us go to Dothan.’”
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  And Joseph went after his brethren and found them in Dothan.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>And when they saw him afar off, even before he
  came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And they said one to another:</span><quote><span>
   Behold, this dreamer cometh.
   </span><verse>20</verse><span>Come now
   therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will
   say, “Some evil beast hath devoured him;” and we shall see what will
   become of his dreams.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said,
  “Let us not kill him.”
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>And Reuben said unto them:</span><quote><span>
   Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and
   lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver
   him to his father again.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they
  stripped Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colors that was on
  him;
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>and they took him, and cast him into a pit; and the pit was empty,
  there was no water in it.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>And they sat down to eat bread; and they lifted up their eyes and
  looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmaelites came from Gilead, with
  their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down
  to Egypt.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>And Judah said unto his brethren:</span><quote><span>
   What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood?
   </span><verse>27</verse><span>Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites,
   and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And his brethren were content.
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>Then there
  passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out
  of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of
  silver; and they brought Joseph into Egypt.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>29</verse><span>And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the
  pit; and he rent his clothes.
  </span><verse>30</verse><span>And he returned unto his brethren, and said, “The child is not; and I,
  whither shall I go?”
  </span><verse>31</verse><span>And they took Joseph’s coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped
  the coat in the blood;
  </span><verse>32</verse><span>and they sent the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their
  father; and said, “This have we found; know now whether it be thy son’s
  coat or no.”
  </span><verse>33</verse><span>And he knew it, and said, “It is my son’s coat; an evil beast hath
  devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>34</verse><span>And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and
  mourned for his son many days.
  </span><verse>35</verse><span>And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he
  refused to be comforted; and he said, “For I will go down into the grave
  unto my son mourning.” Thus his father wept for him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>36</verse><span>And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of
  Pharaoh’s, and captain of the guard.

  Judah and Tamar
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>38
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his
  brethren, and turned into a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was
  Shuah; and he took her, and went in and lay with her.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name
  Shelah; and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the
  LORD slew him.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>And Judah said unto Onan, “Go and marry thy brother’s wife, and raise
  up seed unto thy brother.”
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass,
  when he married his brother’s wife, that he would not lie with her, lest
  he should raise up seed unto his brother.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And the thing which he did displeased the LORD; wherefore he slew him
  also.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter-in-law, “Remain a widow at thy
  father’s house, till Shelah my son be grown;” for he said, “Lest
  peradventure he die also, as his brethren did.” And Tamar went and dwelt
  in her father’s house.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah’s wife died; and
  Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he
  and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And it was told Tamar, saying, “Behold, thy father-in-law goeth up to
  Timnath to shear his sheep.”
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And she put her widow’s garments off from her, and covered her with a
  veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way
  to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given
  unto him to wife.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a harlot; because she had
  covered her face.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And he turned unto her by the way, and said, “Go to, I pray thee, let
  me come in and lie with thee.” (For he knew not that she was his
  daughter-in-law.)
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  And she said, “What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in and lie
  with me?”
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And he said, “I will send thee a kid
  from the flock.” And she said, “Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send
  it?”
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>And he said, “What pledge shall I give
  thee?” And she said, “Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is
  in thine hand.” And he gave it her, and came in and slept with her, and
  she conceived by him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>And she arose, and went away, and laid by her veil from her, and put on
  the garments of her widowhood.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to
  receive his pledge from the woman’s hand; but he found her not.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>Then he asked the men
  of that place, saying, “Where is the harlot, that was openly by the
  wayside?” And they said, “There was no harlot in this place.”
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>And he returned to Judah, and said, “I cannot
  find her. And also the men of the place said that there was no harlot in
  this place.”
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>And Judah said, “Let her take it
  to her, lest we be shamed; behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not
  found her.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah,
  saying, “Tamar thy daughter-in-law hath played the harlot; and also,
  behold, she is with child by whoredom.”
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  And Judah said, “Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>25</verse><span>When she was brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, “Buy
  the man, whose these are, am I with child.” And she said, “Discern, I
  pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.”
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>And Judah acknowledged them, and said, “She hath been more righteous
  than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son.” And he knew her
  again no more.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>27</verse><span>And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins
  were in her womb.
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand;
  and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread saying,
  “This came out first.”
  </span><verse>29</verse><span>And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his
  brother came out; and she said, “How hast thou broken forth? This breach
  be upon thee.” Therefore his name was called Pharez.
  </span><verse>30</verse><span>And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon
  his hand; and his name was called Zarah.

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of
  Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of
  the Ishmaelites, which had brought him down thither.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was
  in the house of his master the Egyptian.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made
  all that he did to prosper in his hand.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him; and he made him
  overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his
  house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian’s
  house for Joseph’s sake; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that
  he had in the house, and in the field.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And he left all that he had in Joseph’s hand; and he knew not aught he
  had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly person,

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>And it came to pass after these things, that his master’s wife cast her
  eyes upon Joseph; and she said, “Lie with me.”
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>But he refused, and said unto his master’s wife:</span><quote><span>

  Joseph interprets the dreams of the butler and chef
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>40
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of
  Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the chief of
  the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into
  the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served
  them; and they continued a season in ward.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night,
  each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and
  the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the prison.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them, and,
  behold, they were sad.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And he asked Pharaoh’s officers that were with him in the ward of his
  lord’s house, saying, “Wherefore look ye so sadly today?”
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>And they said unto him, “We have dreamed a dream, and there is no
  interpreter of it.”
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  And Joseph said unto them, “Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell me
  them, I pray you.”
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>And the chief butler told his
  dream to Joseph, and said to him:
  </span><quote><span>
   In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;
   </span><verse>10</verse><span>and
   in the vine were three branches; and it was as though it budded, and her
   blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes;
   </span><verse>11</verse><span>and Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand; and I took
   the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and I gave the cup into
   Pharaoh’s hand.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>And Joseph said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   This is the interpretation of it: the three branches are three days;
   </span><verse>13</verse><span>yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up
   thine head, and restore thee unto thy place; and thou shalt deliver
   Pharaoh’s cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his
   butler.
   </span><verse>14</verse><span>But think on me when it shall be well
   with thee, and show kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me
   unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house;
   </span><verse>15</verse><span>for indeed I was stolen away out of the land of
   the Hebrews; and here also have I done nothing that they should put me
   into the dungeon.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto
  Joseph:</span><quote><span>
   I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white baskets on my head;
   </span><verse>17</verse><span>and in the uppermost basket there was of all
   manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the
   basket upon my head.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>And Joseph answered and said:</span><quote><span>
   This is the interpretation thereof: the three baskets are three days;
   </span><verse>19</verse><span>yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy
   head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat
   thy flesh from off thee.

  <verse>20</verse><span>And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, that
  he made a feast unto all his servants; and he lifted up the head of the
  chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave
  the cup into Pharaoh’s hand;
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>But he hanged the chief baker; as Joseph had interpreted to them.

 <chapter>41

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed;
  and, behold, he stood by the river.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well-favored kine and
  fat-fleshed; and they fed in a meadow.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river,
  ill-favored and lean-fleshed; and stood by the other kine upon the brink
  of the river.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And the ill-favored and lean-fleshed kine did eat up the seven well-
  favored and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>And he slept and dreamed the second time; and, behold, seven ears of
  corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up
  after them.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And
  Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he
  sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men
  thereof; and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could
  interpret them unto Pharaoh.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying:</span><quote><span>
   I do remember my faults this day;
   </span><verse>10</verse><span>Pharaoh was
   wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard’s
   house, both me and the chief baker;
   </span><verse>11</verse><span>and we
   dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to
   the interpretation of his dream.
   </span><verse>12</verse><span>And there was
   there with us a young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard;
   and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man
   according to his dream he did interpret.
   </span><verse>13</verse><span>And it
   came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine
   office, and him he hanged.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out
  of the dungeon; and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came
  in unto Pharaoh.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>And Pharaoh said unto Joseph:</span><quote><span>
   I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it; and I
   have heard say of thee that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.
  </span></quote>

 <block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>And Pharaoh said unto Joseph:</span><quote>
   <block><span>
    In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river;

    seven kine, fatfleshed and well-favored; and they fed in a meadow;
    </span><verse>19</verse><span>and, behold, seven other kine came up after
    them, poor and very ill-favored and
    lean-fleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness;
    </span><verse>20</verse><span>and the lean in the ill-favored kine did eat up
    the first seven fat kine;
    </span><verse>21</verse><span>and when they had
    eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they
    were still ill-favored, as at the beginning. So I awoke.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>22</verse><span>And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk,
    full and good;
    </span><verse>23</verse><span>and, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east
    wind, sprung up after them;
    </span><verse>24</verse><span>and the thin ears devoured the seven good ears; and I told this unto
    the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.</span></block>

  </quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>25</verse><span>And Joseph said unto Pharaoh:</span><quote>
   <block><span>The dream of Pharaoh is one; God hath showed Pharaoh what he is about to

    </span><verse>26</verse><span>The seven good kine are seven years; and
    the seven good ears are seven years; the dream is one.
    </span><verse>27</verse><span>And the seven thin and ill-favored kine that
    came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with
    the east wind shall be seven years of famine.
    </span><verse>28</verse><span>This is the thing which I have spoken unto
    Pharaoh; what God is about to do he showeth unto Pharaoh.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>29</verse><span>Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land
    of Egypt;
    </span><verse>30</verse><span>and there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the
    plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall
    consume the land;
    </span><verse>31</verse><span>and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine
    following; for it shall be very grievous.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>32</verse><span>And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because
    the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.
    </span><verse>33</verse><span>Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him
    over the land of Egypt.
    </span><verse>34</verse><span>Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and
    take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous
    years.
    </span><verse>35</verse><span>And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay
    up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.
    </span><verse>36</verse><span>And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of
    famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not

   </span><verse>8</verse><span>Behold, the money,

   Pharaoh.
   </span><verse>19</verse><span>My lord asked his servants, saying,
   “Have ye a father, or a brother?”
   </span><verse>20</verse><span>And we said
   unto my lord, “We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a
   little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother,
   and his father loveth him.”
   </span><verse>21</verse><span>And thou saidst
   unto thy servants, “Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon
   him.”
   </span><verse>22</verse><span>And we said unto my lord, “The lad cannot
   leave his father; for if he should leave his father, his father would
   die.”
   </span><verse>23</verse><span>And thou saidst unto thy servants,
   “Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no
   more.”
   </span><verse>24</verse><span>And it came to pass when we came up unto
   thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.
   </span><verse>25</verse><span>And our father said, “Go again, and buy us a
   little food.”
   </span><verse>26</verse><span>And we said, “We cannot go down;
   if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down; for we may not
   see the man’s face, except our youngest brother be with us.”
   </span><verse>27</verse><span>And thy servant my father said unto us, “Ye
   know that my wife bare me two sons;
   </span><verse>28</verse><span>and the one
   went out from me, and I said, ‘Surely he is torn in pieces;’ and I saw him
   not since:
   </span><verse>29</verse><span>and if ye take this also from me,
   and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to
   the grave.”
   </span><verse>30</verse><span>Now therefore when I come to thy
   servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is
   bound up in the lad’s life;
   </span><verse>31</verse><span>it shall come to
   pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die; and thy
   servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with
   sorrow to the grave.
   </span><verse>32</verse><span>For thy servant became
   surety for the lad unto my father, saying, “If I bring him not unto thee,
   then I shall bear the blame to my father forever.”
   </span><verse>33</verse><span>Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant
   abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with
   his brethren.
   </span><verse>34</verse><span>For how shall I go up to my
   father, and the lad be not with me? Lest peradventure I see the evil that
   shall come on my father.

    unto my seed, the land for an everlasting
    possession. Therefore, O my son, he hath blessed me in raising thee up
    to be a servant unto me, in saving my house from
    death; in delivering my people, thy brethren, from
    famine which was sore in the land; wherefore the God of thy fathers shall bless thee, and the fruit of thy loins, that they shall be blessed
    above thy brethren, and above thy father’s house;
    for thou hast prevailed, and thy father’s house hath bowed down unto thee, even as it was shown unto thee, before thou wast
    sold into Egypt by the hands of thy brethren;
    wherefore thy brethren shall bow down unto thee,
    from generation to generation, unto the fruit of thy loins forever; for
    thou shalt be a light unto my people, to deliver
    them in the days of their captivity, from bondage;

    together my people, and he shall lead them as a
    flock, and he shall smite the waters of the Red Sea
    with his rod. And he shall have judgment, and shall write the word of the
    Lord. And he shall not speak many words, for I will
    write unto him my law by the finger of mine own
    hand. And I will make a spokesman for him, and his name shall be
    called Aaron. And it shall be done unto thee in the
    last days also, even as I have sworn.
