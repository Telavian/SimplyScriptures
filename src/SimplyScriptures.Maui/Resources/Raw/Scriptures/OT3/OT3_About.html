   This edition of THE OLD TESTAMENT increases readability by modernizing
   the page layout. The text is formatted into standard paragraphs and white
   space and other modern tools (section headers, bullet lists, etc.) are
   used to help with readability. Chapter and verse references are visually
   subdued so as to not distract from the message.
  </span></block>

  <block><span>
   Words that are part of the actual scriptural record appear in
   serif font. Anything not part of that record
   (verse numbers, section numbers, and section headers) appears in this
   sans-serif font. Anything in a sans-serif font is an addition of men and
   can be treated accordingly.

   This edition uses the text from the Inspired Version, or Joseph Smith
   Translation (JST), of the Bible, while using King James Version verse
   numbers for convenience. Significant changes in wording between the KJV
   text and the JST text are indicated by an
   </span><under><span>underline</span></under><span>, and the KJV text appears in the margin.
   Significant additions not found in the KJV text are indicated by a
   </span><dunder><span>dashed underline</span></dunder><span>.
  </span></block>

   Many text differences between the JST and the KJV have little to no impact
   on the meaning, such as:

   Because the goal of this version is to increase readability, simple
   differences such as these are not indicated. When a change is indicated,
   there is a significant difference that should be given attention.

   In the Hebrew text, the name of God is יהוה ,often transliterated as YHVH or YHWH. In the KJV, that name is represented as LORD or GOD, in all capitals. The JST did not use this method, so textual additions
   do not have these names in all capitals even though surrounding usage would indicate they were
   appropriate. There are two significant variations that are used frequently in the Old Testament:

   This version has minimally updated the archaic English of the original. The -eth verb ending (causeth, doeth,
   etc.) has been updated to modern verb endings (causes, does, etc.). Archaic personal pronouns before a
   vowel sound (mine arm) have also been updated (my arm). When there wasn’t a direct modern equivalent,
   the archaic word was retained. For example, thou lacks a modern equivalent. You is ambiguous and can
   mean one or many – whereas thou is one person only. Thou and its archaic verb endings have been retained.
