  An invasion

  <verse>2</verse><span>Hear this, ye old men,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land.</span></indent><span>
  Hath this been in your days,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>or even in the days of your fathers?</span></indent>
  <verse>3</verse><span>Tell ye your children of it,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and let your children tell their children,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and their children another generation.</span></indent>
  <verse>4</verse><span>That which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten;</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpillar eaten.</span></indent>

  <verse>5</verse><span>Awake, ye drunkards, and weep;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and howl, all ye drinkers of wine,</span></indent><span>
  because of the new wine;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>for it is cut off from your mouth.</span></indent>
  <verse>6</verse><span>For a nation is come up upon my land,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>strong, and without number,</span></indent><span>
  whose teeth are as the teeth of a lion,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and he hath the cheek teeth of a great lion.</span></indent>
  <verse>7</verse><span>He hath laid my vine waste,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and barked my fig tree;</span></indent><span>
  he hath made it clean bare, and cast it away;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the branches thereof are made white.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>for the husband of her youth.</span></indent>
  <verse>9</verse><span>The meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house of the LORD;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the priests, the LORD’s ministers, mourn.</span></indent>
  <indent>
   <verse>10</verse><span>The field is wasted, the land mourneth;</span></indent>
  <indent><span>for the corn is wasted;</span></indent><span>
  the new wine is dried up,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the oil languisheth.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>Be ye ashamed, O ye husbandmen;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>howl, O ye vinedressers,</span></indent><span>
  for the wheat and for the barley;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>because the harvest of the field is perished.</span></indent>
  <verse>12</verse><span>The vine is dried up,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the fig tree languisheth;</span></indent><span>
  the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>even all the trees of the field, are withered;</span></indent>
  <indent><span>because joy is withered away from the sons of men.</span></indent>
  <verse>13</verse><span>Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>howl, ye ministers of the altar;</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  come, lie all night in sackcloth,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>ye ministers of my God;</span></indent><span>
  for the meat offering and the drink offering</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>is withholden from the house of your God.</span></indent>
  <verse>14</verse><span>Sanctify ye a fast, call a solemn assembly,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land</span></indent><span>
  into the house of the LORD your God,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and cry unto the LORD.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>Alas for the day!</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>For the day of the LORD is at hand,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and as a destruction from the Almighty shall it come.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>Is not the meat cut off before our eyes,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>yea, joy and gladness from the house of our God?</span></indent>
  <indent>
   <verse>17</verse><span>The seed is rotten under their clods.</span></indent><span>
  The garners are laid desolate,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the barns are broken down;</span></indent>
  <indent><span>for the corn is withered.</span></indent>
  <verse>18</verse><span>How do the beasts groan!</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>The herds of cattle are perplexed,</span></indent><span>
  because they have no pasture;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>yea, the flocks of sheep are made desolate.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>O Lord, to thee will I cry;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field.</span></indent>
  <verse>20</verse><span>The beasts of the field cry also unto thee;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>for the rivers of water are dried up,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness.</span></indent>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Blow ye the trumpet in Zion,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and sound an alarm in my holy mountain.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>for the day of the LORD cometh,</span></indent><span>
  for it is nigh at hand;</span><break></break>
  <indent>
   <verse>2</verse><span>a day of darkness and of gloominess,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>a day of clouds and of thick darkness,</span></indent><span>
  as the morning spread upon the mountains;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>a great people and a strong;</span></indent><span>
  there hath not been ever the like,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>neither shall be anymore after it,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>even to the years of many generations.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>A fire devoureth before them;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and behind them a flame burneth;</span></indent><span>
  the land is as the garden of Eden before them,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and behind them a desolate wilderness;</span></indent>
  <indent><span>yea, and nothing shall escape them.</span></indent>
  <verse>4</verse><span>The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and as horsemen, so shall they run.</span></indent>
  <verse>5</verse><span>Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>as a strong people set in battle array.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>Before their face the people shall be much pained;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>all faces shall gather blackness.</span></indent>
  <verse>7</verse><span>They shall run like mighty men;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>they shall climb the wall like men of war;</span></indent><span>
  and they shall march everyone on his ways,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and they shall not break their ranks;</span></indent>
  <verse>8</verse><span>neither shall one thrust another;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>they shall walk everyone in his path;</span></indent><span>
  and when they fall upon the sword,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>they shall not be wounded.</span></indent>
  <verse>9</verse><span>They shall run to and fro in the city;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>they shall run upon the wall,</span></indent><span>
  they shall climb up upon the houses;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>they shall enter in at the windows like a thief.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>The earth shall quake before them;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the heavens shall tremble;</span></indent><span>
  the sun and the moon shall be dark,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the stars shall withdraw their shining;</span></indent>
  <verse>11</verse><span>And the LORD shall utter his voice before his army;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>for his camp is very great,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>for he is strong that executeth his word;</span></indent><span>
  for the day of the LORD is great and very terrible;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and who can abide it?</span></indent>

  Rend your heart
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>Therefore also now, saith the LORD,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>turn ye even to me with all your heart,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning;</span></indent>
  <verse>13</verse><span>And rend your heart,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and not your garments,</span></indent>
  <dunder><span>and repent</span></dunder><span>,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and turn unto the LORD your God;</span></indent><span>
  for he is gracious and merciful,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>slow to anger, and of great kindness,</span></indent>
  <indent>
   <under>
    <note><span>And repenteth him of the evil</span></note><span>and he will turn away the evil from you</span></under><span>.</span></indent>
  <under>
   <verse>14</verse><note><span>Who knoweth if he will return and repent</span></note><span>Therefore repent,</span><break></break>
   <indent><span>and who knoweth but he will return and leave a blessing behind him;</span></indent>
  </under><span>
  that you may offer a meat offering,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and a drink offering, unto the LORD your God?</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>Blow the trumpet in Zion,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>sanctify a fast,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>call a solemn assembly;</span></indent>
  <verse>16</verse><span>gather the people,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>sanctify the congregation,</span></indent><span>
  assemble the elders,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>gather the children,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and those that suck the breasts;</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the bride out of her closet.</span></indent>
  <verse>17</verse><span>Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>weep between the porch and the altar,</span></indent><span>
  and let them say, “Spare thy people, O Lord,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and give not thine heritage to reproach,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>that the heathen should rule over them;</span></indent><span>
  wherefore should they say among the people,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>‘Where is their God?’”</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>Then will the LORD be jealous for his land,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and pity his people.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>Yea, the LORD will answer and say unto his people,</span><break></break><span>
  “Behold, I will send you corn, and wine, and oil,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and ye shall be satisfied therewith;</span></indent><span>
  and I will no more make you a reproach among the heathen.</span><break></break>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>But I will remove far off from you the northern army,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and will drive him into a land barren and desolate,</span></indent><span>
  with his face toward the east sea,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and his hinder part toward the utmost sea,</span></indent><span>
  and his stink shall come up,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and his ill savor shall come up.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  Because he hath done great things,</span><break></break>
  <indent>
   <verse>21</verse><span>Fear not, O land;</span></indent>
  <indent><span>be glad and rejoice;</span></indent><span>
  for the LORD will do great things.</span><break></break>
  <indent>
   <verse>22</verse><span>Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field;</span></indent>
  <indent><span>for the pastures of the wilderness do spring,</span></indent><span>
  for the tree beareth her fruit,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the fig tree and the vine do yield their strength.</span></indent>
  <verse>23</verse><span>Be glad then, ye children of Zion,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and rejoice in the LORD your God;</span></indent><span>
  for he hath given you the former rain moderately,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and he will cause to come down for you the rain,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>the former rain, and the latter rain in the first month.</span></indent>
  <verse>24</verse><span>And the floors shall be full of wheat,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the vats shall overflow with wine and oil.</span></indent>
  <verse>25</verse><span>And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the cankerworm, and the caterpillar, and the palmerworm,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>my great army which I sent among you.</span></indent>
  <verse>26</verse><span>And ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and praise the name of the LORD your God that hath dealt wondrously with you;</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and my people shall never be ashamed.</span></indent>
  <verse>27</verse><span>And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and that I am the LORD your God, and none else;</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and my people shall never be ashamed.</span></indent>

 <block>
  <verse>28</verse><span>And it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,</span></indent><span>
  your old men shall dream dreams,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>your young men shall see visions;</span></indent>
  <verse>29</verse><span>And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids</span><break></break>

  <indent><span>blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.</span></indent>
  <verse>31</verse><span>The sun shall be turned into darkness,</span><break></break>

  <verse>32</verse><span>And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the LORD</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>shall be delivered;</span></indent><span>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>For, behold, in those days, and in that time,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>when I shall bring again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,</span></indent>
  <verse>2</verse><span>I will also gather all nations,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat,</span></indent><span>
  and will plead with them there for my people and for my heritage Israel,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>whom they have scattered among the nations, and parted my land.</span></indent>
  <verse>3</verse><span>And they have cast lots for my people;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and have given a boy for a harlot,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and sold a girl for wine, that they might drink.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Yea, and what have ye to do with me, O Tyre, and Zidon, and all the
  coasts of Palestine? Will ye render me a recompense? And if ye
  recompense me, swiftly and speedily will I return your recompense upon
  your own head;
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>because ye have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried into your
  temples my goodly pleasant things;
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>the children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye sold
  unto the Grecians, that ye might remove them far from their
  border.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>Behold, I will raise them out of the place whither ye have sold them,
  and will return your recompense upon your own head;
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>and I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hands of the
  children of Judah, and they shall sell them to the Sabeans, to a people
  far off; for the LORD hath spoken it.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>Prepare war.</span></indent><span>
  Wake up the mighty men.</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>Let all the men of war draw near; let them come up.</span></indent>
  <verse>10</verse><span>Beat your ploughshares into swords,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and your pruning hooks into spears;</span></indent><span>
  let the weak say,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>‘I am strong.’</span></indent>
  <verse>11</verse><span>Assemble yourselves, and come, all ye heathen,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and gather yourselves together round about.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  Thither cause thy mighty ones to come down, O LORD.</span><break></break>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>Let the heathen be wakened,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat;</span></indent><span>
  for there will I sit</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>to judge all the heathen round about.</span></indent>
  <verse>13</verse><span>Put ye in the sickle,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>for the harvest is ripe.</span></indent><span>
  Come, get you down;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>for the press is full,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>the vats overflow;</span></indent><span>
  for their wickedness is great.</span><break></break>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>for the day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision.</span></indent>
  <verse>15</verse><span>The sun and the moon shall be darkened,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the stars shall withdraw their shining.</span></indent>
  <verse>16</verse><span>The LORD also shall roar out of Zion,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and utter his voice from Jerusalem;</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and the heavens and the earth shall shake;</span></indent><span>
  but the LORD will be the hope of his people,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the strength of the children of Israel.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>So shall ye know that I am the LORD your God</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain;</span></indent><span>
  then shall Jerusalem be holy,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and there shall no strangers pass through her anymore.</span></indent>
  <verse>18</verse><span>And it shall come to pass in that day,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>that the mountains shall drop down new wine,</span></indent><span>
  and the hills shall flow with milk,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters,</span></indent><span>
  and a fountain shall come forth of the house of the LORD,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and shall water the valley of Shittim.</span></indent>
  <verse>19</verse><span>Egypt shall be a desolation,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness,</span></indent><span>
  for the violence against the children of Judah,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>because they have shed innocent blood in their land.</span></indent>
  <verse>20</verse><span>But Judah shall dwell forever,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and Jerusalem from generation to generation.</span></indent>
  <verse>21</verse><span>For I will cleanse their blood that I have not cleansed;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>for the LORD dwelleth in Zion.</span></indent>
