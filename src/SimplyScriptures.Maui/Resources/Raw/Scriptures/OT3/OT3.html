 <book><span>ABOUT THIS EDITION</span></book>
 <journalaccount>
  <block><span>
   This edition of THE OLD TESTAMENT increases readability by modernizing
   the page layout. The text is formatted into standard paragraphs and white
   space and other modern tools (section headers, bullet lists, etc.) are
   used to help with readability. Chapter and verse references are visually
   subdued so as to not distract from the message.
  </span></block>

  <block><span>
   Words that are part of the actual scriptural record appear in
   serif font. Anything not part of that record
   (verse numbers, section numbers, and section headers) appears in this
   sans-serif font. Anything in a sans-serif font is an addition of men and
   can be treated accordingly.
  </span></block>

  <block><span>
   This edition uses the text from the Inspired Version, or Joseph Smith
   Translation (JST), of the Bible, while using King James Version verse
   numbers for convenience. Significant changes in wording between the KJV
   text and the JST text are indicated by an
   </span><under><span>underline</span></under><span>, and the KJV text appears in the margin.
   Significant additions not found in the KJV text are indicated by a
   </span><dunder><span>dashed underline</span></dunder><span>.
  </span></block>

  <block><span>
   Many text differences between the JST and the KJV have little to no impact
   on the meaning, such as:

    they
    </span><under><span>that</span></under><span>

    thirst after righteousness

   Because the goal of this version is to increase readability, simple
   differences such as these are not indicated. When a change is indicated,
   there is a significant difference that should be given attention.

   In the Hebrew text, the name of God is יהוה ,often transliterated as YHVH or YHWH. In the KJV, that name is represented as LORD or GOD, in all capitals. The JST did not use this method, so textual additions
   do not have these names in all capitals even though surrounding usage would indicate they were
   appropriate. There are two significant variations that are used frequently in the Old Testament:

   This version has minimally updated the archaic English of the original. The -eth verb ending (causeth, doeth,
   etc.) has been updated to modern verb endings (causes, does, etc.). Archaic personal pronouns before a
   vowel sound (mine arm) have also been updated (my arm). When there wasn’t a direct modern equivalent,
   the archaic word was retained. For example, thou lacks a modern equivalent. You is ambiguous and can
   mean one or many – whereas thou is one person only. Thou and its archaic verb endings have been retained.

  <verse>1</verse><span>The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and
  Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of
  Judah.

 <heading><span>
  A sinful nation
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>for the LORD hath spoken,</span></indent><span>
  “I have nourished and brought up children,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and they have rebelled against me.</span></indent>
  <verse>3</verse><span>The ox knoweth his owner,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the ass his master’s crib;</span></indent><span>
  but Israel doth not know,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>my people doth not consider.”</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Ah sinful nation,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>a people laden with iniquity,</span></indent><span>
  a seed of evildoers,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>children that are corrupters;</span></indent><span>
  they have forsaken the LORD,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>they are gone away backward.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>Why should ye be stricken anymore?</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>Ye will revolt more and more.</span></indent><span>
  The whole head is sick,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the whole heart faint.</span></indent>
  <verse>6</verse><span>From the sole of the foot even unto the head</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>there is no soundness in it;</span></indent><span>
  but wounds, and bruises,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and putrifying sores;</span></indent><span>
  they have not been closed; neither bound up,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>neither mollified with ointment.</span></indent>
 </block>

  <verse>7</verse><span>Your country is desolate,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>your cities are burned with fire;</span></indent><span>
  your land, strangers devour it in your presence,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.</span></indent>
  <verse>8</verse><span>And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.</span></indent>
  <verse>9</verse><span>Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>we should have been as Sodom,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and we should have been like unto Gomorrah.</span></indent>

  Meaningless offerings
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom.</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>Give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.</span></indent>
  <verse>11</verse><span>“To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me?” saith the LORD;</span><break></break><span>
  “I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.</span></indent>
  <verse>12</verse><span>When ye come to appear before me,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?</span></indent>
  <verse>13</verse><span>Bring no more vain oblations;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>incense is an abomination unto me;</span></indent><span>
  the new moons and Sabbaths, the calling of assemblies,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>I cannot away with; it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting.</span></indent>
  <verse>14</verse><span>Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.</span></indent>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  Your hands are full of blood.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>Wash ye, make you clean;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;</span></indent>
  <verse>17</verse><span>learn to do well; seek judgment,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>relieve the oppressed,</span></indent><span>
  judge the fatherless,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>plead for the widow.”</span></indent>

  <verse>18</verse><span>“Come now, and let us reason together,” saith the LORD.</span><break></break>

  “Though your sins be as scarlet,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>they shall be as white as snow;</span></indent><span>
  though they be red like crimson,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>they shall be as wool.</span></indent>
  <verse>19</verse><span>If ye be willing and obedient,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>ye shall eat the good of the land;</span></indent>
  <verse>20</verse><span>but if ye refuse and rebel,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>ye shall be devoured with the sword;”</span></indent>
  <indent><span>for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.</span></indent>

  Zion is corrupted
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>How is the faithful city</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>become a harlot!</span></indent><span>
  It was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>but now murderers.</span></indent>
  <verse>22</verse><span>Thy silver is become dross,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>thy wine mixed with water;</span></indent>
  <verse>23</verse><span>thy princes are rebellious,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and companions of thieves;</span></indent><span>
  everyone loveth gifts,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and followeth after rewards;</span></indent><span>
  they judge not the fatherless,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>Therefore saith the LORD,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the LORD of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel,</span></indent><span>
  “Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and avenge me of mine enemies.</span></indent>
  <verse>25</verse><span>And I will turn my hand upon thee;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin;</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>26</verse><span>and I will restore thy judges as at the first,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and thy counselors as at the beginning;</span></indent><span>
  afterward thou shalt be called the city of righteousness,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the faithful city.”</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>27</verse><span>Zion shall be redeemed with judgment,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and her converts with righteousness.</span></indent>
  <verse>28</verse><span>And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>29</verse><span>For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.</span></indent>
  <verse>30</verse><span>For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and as a garden that hath no water.</span></indent>
  <verse>31</verse><span>And the strong shall be as tow,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the maker of it as a spark,</span></indent><span>
  and they shall both burn together,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and none shall quench them.</span></indent>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.</span><break></break>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>And it shall come to pass in the last days:</span><break></break><span>
  When the mountain of the LORD’s house shall be established</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>in the top of the mountains,</span></indent><span>
  and shall be exalted above the hills,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and all nations shall flow unto it.</span></indent>

  and he will teach us of his ways,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and we will walk in his paths.”</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  For out of Zion shall go forth the law,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem;</span></indent>
  <verse>4</verse><span>and he shall judge among the nations,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and shall rebuke many people;</span></indent><span>
  and they shall beat their swords into ploughshares,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and their spears into pruning hooks;</span></indent><span>
  nation shall not lift up sword against nation,</span><break></break>

 <chapter>6

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the LORD sitting upon a
  throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>Above it stood the seraphim; each one had six wings; with twain he
  covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he
  did fly.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And one cried unto another, and said, “Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of
  hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory.”
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the
  house was filled with smoke.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>Then said I, “Woe is me! For I am undone; because I am a man of unclean
  lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for mine
  eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>Then flew one of the seraphim unto me, having a live coal in his hand,
  which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar;
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>and he laid it upon my mouth, and said, “Lo, this has touched thy lips;
  and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>Also I heard the voice of the LORD, saying, “Whom shall I send, and who
  will go for us?” Then said I, “Here am I; send me.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>And he said, “Go, and tell this people,</span><break></break><span>
  ‘Hear ye indeed, but they understood not;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and see ye indeed, but they perceived not.’</span></indent>
  <verse>10</verse><span>Make the heart of this people fat,</span><break></break>

 <chapter>7

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of
  Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son
  of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war against it,
  but could not prevail against it.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with
  Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the
  tress of the wood are moved with the wind.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>Then said the LORD unto Isaiah:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>
    Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou, and Shear-jashub thy son, at the end of
    the conduit of the upper pool, in the highway of the fuller’s field;
    </span><verse>4</verse><span>and say unto him, “Take heed, and be quiet; fear
    not, neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking
    firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of
    Remaliah.
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of
    Remaliah, have taken evil counsel against thee, saying,
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>‘Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let
    us make a breach therein for us, and set a king in the midst of it, yea,
    even the son of Tabeal.’”

   <block>
    <verse>7</verse><span>Thus saith the Lord GOD: It shall not stand, neither shall it come to
    pass.
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin;
    and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken, that it be
    not a people.
    </span><verse>9</verse><span>And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is
    Remaliah’s son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be

  <verse>12</verse><span>But Ahaz said, “I will not ask, neither will I tempt the LORD.”

  </span><verse>2</verse><span>at the same time spake the LORD by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, “Go
  and loose the sackcloth from off thy loins, and put off thy shoe from
  thy foot.” And he did so, walking naked and barefoot.

  <verse>3</verse><span>And the LORD said:</span><quote><span>
   Like as my servant Isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot three years for a

   shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians prisoners, and the
   Ethiopians captives, young and old, naked and barefoot, even with their
   buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt.
   </span><verse>5</verse><span>And
   they shall be afraid and ashamed of Ethiopia their expectation, and of
   Egypt their glory.
   </span><verse>6</verse><span>And the inhabitant of this

  <verse>26</verse><span>For his God doth instruct him to discretion,</span><break></break>

  A book shall come forth
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <dunder><span>
   And it shall come to pass, that the Lord God shall bring forth unto you
   the words of a book; and they shall be the words of
   them which have slumbered. And behold, the book shall be sealed; and in the book shall be a revelation from God, from the
   beginning of the world to the ending thereof.
   Wherefore because of the things which are sealed up, the
   things which are sealed shall not be delivered in the day of the
   wickedness and abominations of the people.
   Wherefore, the book shall be kept from them.</span></dunder>
 </block>

 <block>
  <dunder><span>
   But the book shall be delivered unto a man, and he shall deliver the words
   of the book, which are the words of those who have
   slumbered in the dust; and he shall deliver these words unto another, but the words that are sealed he shall not deliver,
   neither shall he deliver the book. For the book
   shall be sealed by the power of God, and the revelation which was sealed shall be kept in the book until the own due time of the
   Lord, that they may come forth; for behold, they
   reveal all things from the foundation of the world unto the end thereof. And the day cometh, that the words of the book which
   were sealed shall be read upon the housetops; and
   they shall be read by the power of Christ; and all things shall be revealed unto the children of men which ever have been among the
   children of men, and which ever will be, even unto
   the end of the earth.</span></dunder>
 </block>

 <block>
  <dunder><span>
   Wherefore, at that day when the book shall be delivered unto the man of
   whom I have spoken, the book shall be hid from the
   eyes of the world, that the eyes of none shall behold it, save it be that three witnesses shall behold it by the power
   of God, besides him to whom the book shall be
   delivered; and they shall testify to the truth of the book and the things therein. And there is none other which shall view it, save it
   be a few according to the will of God, to bear
   testimony of his word unto the children of men; for the Lord God hath said, that the words of the faithful should speak as it were
   from the dead.
  </span></dunder>
 </block>

 <block>
  <dunder><span>
   Wherefore, the Lord God will proceed to bring forth the words of the book;
   and in the mouth of as many witnesses as seemeth
   him good will he establish his word; and woe be unto him that rejecteth the word of God.
  </span></dunder>
 </block>

 <block>
  <dunder><span>
   But, behold, it shall come to pass, that the Lord God shall say unto him
   to whom he shall deliver the book, “Take these
   words which are not sealed and deliver them to another,” that he may show them unto the learned, saying, “Read this, I pray thee.”
   And the learned shall say, “Bring hither the book
   and I will read them.” And now because of the glory of the world, and to get gain will they say this, and not for the glory of
   God. And the man shall say, “I cannot bring the
   book for it is sealed.” Then shall the learned say, “I cannot read it.”
  </span></dunder>
 </block>

 <block>
  <dunder><span>
   Wherefore it shall come to pass, that the Lord God will deliver again the
   book and the words thereof to him that is not
   learned; and the man that is not learned shall say, “I am not learned.” Then shall the Lord God say unto him:
   </span><quote><span>
    The learned shall not read them, for they have rejected them, and I am
    able to do mine own work; wherefore thou shalt read
    the words which I shall give unto thee. Touch not
    the things which are sealed, for I will bring them forth in mine own
    due time; for I will show unto the children of men
    that I am able to do mine own work. Wherefore, when
    thou hast read the words which I have commanded thee, and obtained the witnesses which I have promised unto thee, then shalt thou
    seal up the book again, and hide it up unto me,
    that I may preserve the words which thou hast not read until I shall see fit in mine own wisdom to reveal all
    things unto the children of men. For behold, I am God; and I am a God of miracles; and I will show
    unto the world that I am the same yesterday, today,
    and forever; and I work not among the children of
    men, save it be according to their faith.</span></quote>

  Assyria threatens Jerusalem
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>36
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, the
  Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the defensed cities of
  Judah, and took them.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto
  king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the
  upper pool in the highway of the fuller’s field.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>Then
  came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah’s son, which was over the house, and
  Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph’s son, the recorder.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>And Rabshakeh said unto them:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>
    Say ye now to Hezekiah: Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria,
    “What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>I say, thy words are but vain when thou sayest,
    ‘I have counsel and strength for war.’ Now, on whom dost thou trust that
    thou rebellest against me?
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>Lo, thou trustest in
    the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go
    into his hand, and pierce it; so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that
    trust in him.
    </span><verse>7</verse><span>But if thou say to me, ‘We trust
    in the LORD our God;’ is it not he, whose high places and whose altars
    Hezekiah hath taken away, and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, ‘Ye shall
    worship before this altar?’”
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>8</verse><span>Now therefore give pledges, I pray thee, to my master the king of
    Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on
    thy part to set riders upon them.
    </span><verse>9</verse><span>How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my
    master’s servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for
    horsemen?
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>And am I now come up without the LORD against this land to destroy it?
    The LORD said unto me, ‘Go up against this land, and destroy it.’</span></block>

  </quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, “Speak, I pray
  thee, unto thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it;
  and speak not to us in the Jews’ language, in the ears of the people
  that are on the wall.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>But Rabshakeh said, “Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee
  to speak these words? Hath he not sent me to the men that sit upon the
  wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with
  you?”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews’
  language, and said:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of
   Assyria.
    </span><verse>14</verse><span>Thus saith the king, “Let not Hezekiah deceive you; for he shall not be
    able to deliver you.
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, ‘The LORD will
    surely deliver us; this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the
    king of Assyria.’”</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>16</verse><span>Hearken not to Hezekiah; for thus saith the king of Assyria, “Make an
    agreement with me by a present, and come out to me; and eat ye everyone
    of his vine, and everyone of his fig tree, and drink ye everyone the
    waters of his own cistern;
    </span><verse>17</verse><span>until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of
    corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.”</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>18</verse><span>Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, “The LORD will deliver us.”
    Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand
    of the king of Assyria?
    </span><verse>19</verse><span>Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of
    Sepharvaim? And have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?
    </span><verse>20</verse><span>Who are they among all the gods of these lands, that have delivered
    their land out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of
    my hand?</span></block>

  </quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>But they held their peace, and answered him not a word; for the king’s
  commandment was, saying, “Answer him not.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>Then came Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, that was over the household, and
  Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, to Hezekiah
  with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>Deliverance from Assyria foretold
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>37
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his
  clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of
  the LORD.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe,
  and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, unto Isaiah the
  prophet the son of Amoz.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And they said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   Thus said Hezekiah, “This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of
   blasphemy; for the children are come to the birth, and there is not
   strength to bring forth.
   </span><verse>4</verse><span>It may be the LORD thy
   God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master
   hath sent to reproach the living God, and will reprove the words which the
   LORD thy God hath heard; wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that
   is left.”
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And Isaiah said unto them:</span><quote><span>
   Thus shall ye say unto your master, “Thus saith the LORD: Be not afraid of
   the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of
   Assyria have blasphemed me.
   </span><verse>7</verse><span>Behold, I will send
   a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumor, and return to his own land;
   and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.”
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against
  Libnah; for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, “He is come
  forth to make war with thee.” And when he heard it, he sent messengers
  to Hezekiah, saying:</span><quote>
   <verse>10</verse><span>Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, “Let not thy
   God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying, ‘Jerusalem shall not
   be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.’
   </span><verse>11</verse><span>Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all
   lands by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered?
   </span><verse>12</verse><span>Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have
   destroyed, as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden
   which were in Telassar?
   </span><verse>13</verse><span>Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad? And the king of the
   city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?”</span></quote>

  Hezekiah’s prayer
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and
  read it; and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the LORD, and spread it
  before the LORD.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>And Hezekiah prayed unto the LORD, saying:</span><quote>
   <verse>16</verse><span>O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, that dwellest between the cherubim,
   thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth;
   thou hast made heaven and earth.
   </span><verse>17</verse><span>Incline thine ear, O LORD, and hear; open thine eyes, O LORD, and see;
   and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which he hath sent to reproach
   the living God.
   </span><verse>18</verse><span>Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations,
   and their countries,
   </span><verse>19</verse><span>and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no gods, but the
   work of men’s hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them.
   </span><verse>20</verse><span>Now therefore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all the
   kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the LORD, even thou
   only.</span></quote>

  <verse>21</verse><span>Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying:

    Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, whereas thou hast prayed to me against
    Sennacherib king of Assyria;

    “The virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath despised thee, and laughed thee to scorn;</span><break></break>

    <indent><span>Even against the Holy One of Israel.</span></indent>
    <verse>24</verse><span>By thy servants hast thou reproached the LORD, and hast said,</span><break></break>

  <verse>1</verse><span>In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet the

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed unto the

  </span><verse>3</verse><span>and said, “Remember now, O Lord, I beseech thee, how I have walked
  before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which
  is good in thy sight.” And Hezekiah wept sore.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah, saying:</span><quote>
   <verse>5</verse><span>Go, and say to Hezekiah, “Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy
   father: I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears; behold, I will
   add unto thy days fifteen years.
   </span><verse>6</verse><span>And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of

  <verse>1</verse><span>At that time Merodach-baladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon,
  sent letters and a present to Hezekiah; for he had heard that he had
  been sick, and was recovered.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And Hezekiah was glad of them, and showed them the house of his
  precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the
  precious ointment, and all the house of his armor, and all that was
  found in his treasures; there was nothing in his house, nor in all his
  dominion, that Hezekiah showed him not.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him,
  “What said these men? And from whence came they unto thee?” And Hezekiah
  said, “They are come from a far country unto me, even from
  Babylon.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Then said he, “What have they seen in thine house?” And Hezekiah
  answered, “All that is in mine house have they seen; there is nothing
  among my treasures that I have not showed them.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah:</span><quote><span>
   Hear the word of the LORD of hosts;
   </span><verse>6</verse><span>behold, the
   days come, that all that is in thine house, and that which thy fathers
   have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried to Babylon; nothing
   shall be left, saith the LORD.
   </span><verse>7</verse><span>And of thy sons
   that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away;
   and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.
  </span></quote>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, “Good is the word of the LORD which thou
  hast spoken.” He said moreover, “For there shall be peace and truth in
  my days.”

  your lips have spoken lies,</span><break></break>

  <verse>16</verse><span>And he saw that there was no man,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and wondered that there was no intercessor;</span></indent><span>
  therefore his arm brought salvation unto him;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and his righteousness, it sustained him.</span></indent>
  <verse>17</verse><span>For he put on righteousness as a breastplate,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and a helmet of salvation upon his head;</span></indent><span>

  <indent><span>and was clad with zeal as a cloak.</span></indent>
  <verse>18</verse><span>According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>fury to his adversaries, recompense to his enemies;</span></indent>
  <indent><span>to the islands he will repay recompense.</span></indent>
  <verse>19</verse><span>So shall they fear the name of the LORD from the west,</span><break></break>

  <verse>6</verse><span>Set up the standard toward Zion;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>retire, stay not;</span></indent><span>

  <verse>10</verse><span>Then said I, “Ah, Lord GOD! Surely thou hast greatly deceived this

  <verse>11</verse><span>At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, “A dry

  <indent><span>the alarm of war.</span></indent>
  <verse>20</verse><span>Destruction upon destruction is cried;</span><break></break>

  <verse>23</verse><span>I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void; and the heavens, and they had no light.</span><break></break>

  <verse>25</verse><span>I beheld, and, lo, there was no man,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and all the birds of the heavens were fled.</span></indent>
  <verse>26</verse><span>I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the LORD,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and by his fierce anger.</span></indent>
  <verse>27</verse><span>For thus hath the LORD said, “The whole land shall be desolate;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>yet will I not make a full end.</span></indent>
  <verse>28</verse><span>For this shall the earth mourn,</span><break></break>

  <indent><span>I have purposed it, and will not repent,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>neither will I turn back from it.</span></indent>
  <verse>29</verse><span>The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>they shall go into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks;</span></indent><span>
  every city shall be forsaken,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and not a man dwell therein.</span></indent>

  <indent><span>that seeketh the truth;</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and I will pardon it.</span></indent>
  <verse>2</verse><span>And though they say, “The LORD liveth;”</span><break></break>

  <verse>3</verse><span>OLord, are not thine eyes upon the truth?</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>Thou hast stricken them, but they have not grieved;</span></indent>
  <indent><span>thou hast consumed them, but they have refused to receive correction.</span></indent><span>
  They have made their faces harder than a rock;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>they have refused to return.</span></indent>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Therefore I said, “Surely these are poor;</span><break></break>

   <block><span>
    Hear the word of the LORD, all ye of Judah, that enter in at these gates
    to worship the LORD.
    </span><verse>3</verse><span>Thus saith the LORD of
    hosts, the God of Israel: Amend your ways and your doings, and I will
    cause you to dwell in this place.
    </span><verse>4</verse><span>Trust ye not
    in lying words, saying, ‘The temple of the LORD, The temple of the LORD,
    The temple of the LORD, are these.’
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>5</verse><span>For if ye thoroughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye thoroughly

    not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to your
    hurt;
    </span><verse>7</verse><span>then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave
    to your fathers, forever and ever.
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>Behold, ye trust in lying words, that cannot profit.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>9</verse><span>Will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn
    incense unto Baal, and walk after other gods whom ye know not;
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>and come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name,
    and say, ‘We are delivered to do all these abominations?’
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in
    your eyes? Behold, even I have seen it, saith the LORD.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>12</verse><span>But go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I set my name at
    the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people
    Israel.
    </span><verse>13</verse><span>And now, because ye have done all these works, saith the LORD, and I
    spake unto you, rising up early and speaking, but ye heard not; and I
    called you, but ye answered not;
    </span><verse>14</verse><span>Therefore will I do unto this house, which is called by my name,
    wherein ye trust, and unto the place which I gave to you and to your
    fathers, as I have done to Shiloh.

  <verse>16</verse><span>Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer

  </span><verse>18</verse><span>The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the

   <verse>21</verse><span>Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Put your burnt

   brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or
   sacrifices;

   your God, and ye shall be my people; and walk ye in all the ways that I
   have commanded you, that it may be well unto you.’
   </span><verse>24</verse><span>But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in the
   counsels, and in the imagination of their evil heart, and went backward,
   and not forward.
   </span><verse>25</verse><span>Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt
   unto this day, I have even sent unto you all my servants the prophets,
   daily rising up early and sending them.
   </span><verse>26</verse><span>Yet they hearkened not unto me, nor inclined their ear, but hardened
   their neck; they did worse than their fathers.</span></block>

  <block>
   <verse>27</verse><span>Therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them; but they will not
   hearken to thee; thou shalt also call unto them; but they will not
   answer thee.
   </span><verse>28</verse><span>But thou shalt say unto them, ‘This is a nation that obeyeth not the
   voice of the LORD their God, nor receiveth correction; truth is
   perished, and is cut off from their mouth.
   </span><verse>29</verse><span>Cut off thine hair, O Jerusalem, and cast it away, and take up a

  <block>
   <verse>30</verse><span>For the children of Judah have done evil in my sight, saith the LORD;
   they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my
   name, to pollute it.
   </span><verse>31</verse><span>And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley
   of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the
   fire; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart.
   </span><verse>32</verse><span>Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it shall no more
   be called Tophet, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of
   slaughter; for they shall bury in Tophet, till there be no place.
   </span><verse>33</verse><span>And the carcasses of this people shall be meat for the fowls of the
   heaven, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall fray them away.
   </span><verse>34</verse><span>Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the
   streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the
   voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride; for the land shall

  <verse>1</verse><span>The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying:</span><quote>
   <verse>2</verse><span>Hear ye the words of this covenant, and speak unto the men of Judah,
   and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem;
   </span><verse>3</verse><span>and say thou unto them, “Thus saith the LORD God of Israel: Cursed be
   the man that obeyeth not the words of this covenant,
   </span><verse>4</verse><span>which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out
   of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, ‘Obey my voice, and
   do them, according to all which I command you; so shall ye be my people,
   and I will be your God;
   </span><verse>5</verse><span>that I may perform the oath which I have sworn unto your fathers, to
   give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day.’</span></quote>

 <block><span>
  Then answered I, and said, ‘So be it, O LORD.’
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>Then the LORD said unto me:
  </span><quote><span>
   Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of
   Jerusalem, saying, “Hear ye the words of this covenant, and do them.
   </span><verse>7</verse><span>For I earnestly protested unto
   your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt,
   even unto this day, rising early and protesting, saying, ‘Obey my voice.’
   </span><verse>8</verse><span>Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but
   walked everyone in the imagination of their evil heart; therefore I will
   bring upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to
   do; but they did them not.

  <verse>9</verse><span>And the LORD said unto me:</span><quote><span>
   A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of
   Jerusalem.
   </span><verse>10</verse><span>They are turned back to the
   iniquities of their forefathers, which refused to hear my words; and they
   went after other gods to serve them; the house of Israel and the house of
   Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.

  <verse>11</verse><span>Therefore thus saith the LORD:

    Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to
    escape; and though they shall cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them.
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>Then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants
    of Jerusalem go, and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense; but
    they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble.
    </span><verse>13</verse><span>For according to the number of thy cities were
    thy gods, O Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem
    have ye set up altars to that shameful thing, even altars to burn incense
    unto Baal.
   </span></block>

   <block>

  <verse>1</verse><span>Thus saith the LORD unto me, “Go and get thee a linen girdle, and put

  <verse>6</verse><span>And it came to pass after many days, that the LORD said unto me,

    sin that we have committed against the LORD our God?’
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>Then shalt thou say unto them, ‘Because your fathers have forsaken me,

  <verse>1</verse><span>Now Pashur the son of Immer the priest, who was also chief governor in
  the house of the LORD, heard that Jeremiah prophesied these things.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>Then Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that
  were in the high gate of Benjamin, which was by the house of the LORD.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashur brought forth Jeremiah
  out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah unto him:</span><quote><span>
   The LORD hath not called thy name Pashur, but Magor-missabib.
   </span><verse>4</verse><span>For thus saith the LORD, “Behold, I will make
   thee a terror to thyself, and to all thy friends; and they shall fall by
   the sword of their enemies, and thine eyes shall behold it; and I will
   give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry
   them captive into Babylon, and shall slay them with the sword.
   </span><verse>5</verse><span>Moreover I will deliver all the strength of this
   city, and all the labors thereof, and all the precious things thereof, and
   all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their
   enemies, which shall spoil them, and take them, and carry them to Babylon.
   </span><verse>6</verse><span>And thou, Pashur, and all that dwell in thine
   house, shall go into captivity; and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there
   thou shalt die, and shalt be buried there, thou, and all thy friends, to
   whom thou hast prophesied lies.”

    them into the midst of this city.
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>And I myself
    will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm,
    even in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath.
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>And I will smite the inhabitants of this city,
    both man and beast; they shall die of a great pestilence.

    left in this city from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the
    famine, into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand
    of their enemies, and into the hand of those that seek their life; and he

  Two baskets of figs
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>24
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>The LORD showed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs were set before
  the temple of the LORD, after that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had
  carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, and
  the princes of Judah, with the carpenters and smiths, from Jerusalem,
  and had brought them to Babylon.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>One basket had very good
  figs, even like the figs that are first ripe; and the other basket had
  very naughty figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>Then said the LORD unto me, “What seest thou, Jeremiah?” And I said,
  “Figs; the good figs, very good; and the evil, very evil, that cannot be
  eaten, they are so evil.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:
  </span><quote>
   <block>
    <verse>5</verse><span>Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: Like these good figs, so will I
    acknowledge them that are carried away captive of Judah, whom I have
    sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans for their good.
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them
    again to this land; and I will build them, and not pull them down; and I
    will plant them, and not pluck them up.
    </span><verse>7</verse><span>And I will give them a heart to know me, that I am the LORD; and they
    shall be my people, and I will be their God; for they shall return unto
    me with their whole heart.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>8</verse><span>And as the evil figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so evil; surely
    thus saith the LORD: So will I give Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his
    princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and
    them that dwell in the land of Egypt;
    </span><verse>9</verse><span>and I will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the
    earth for their hurt, to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a
    curse, in all places whither I shall drive them.
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among them,

    <verse>12</verse><span>And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, that I

    written in this book, which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the

   </span><verse>3</verse><span>If so be they

    <note><span>that I may repent me of</span></note><span>and repent, I will turn away</span></under><span>
   the evil which I purpose to do unto

 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah
  speaking these words in the house of the LORD.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that
  the LORD had commanded him to speak unto all the people, that the

  </span><verse>9</verse><span>Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, ‘This house

  </span><verse>17</verse><span>Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spake to all the
  assembly of the people, saying,
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>“Micah the
  Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spake to
  all the people of Judah, saying, ‘Thus saith the LORD of hosts: Zion shall
  be ploughed like a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the
  mountain of the house of the LORD as the high places of a forest.’
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>Did Hezekiah, king of Judah, and all Judah put
  him at all to death? Did he not fear the LORD and beseech the LORD
  </span><under>
   <note><span>and the LORD repented him of</span></note><span>and repent? And the Lord turned away</span></under><span>
  the evil which he had
  pronounced against them. Thus by putting Jeremiah to death we might
  procure great evil against our souls.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>But there was a man among the priests, rose up
  and said, that, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjath-Jearim,
  </span><dunder><span>prophesied in the name of the Lord</span></dunder><span>, who also prophesied against
  this city, and against this land, according to all the words of Jeremiah;

   Amen; the LORD do so; the LORD perform thy words which thou hast

  And the prophet Jeremiah went his way.

   the yokes of wood; but thou shalt make for them yokes of iron.
   </span><verse>14</verse><span>For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: I have put a yoke
   of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve
   Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him; and I have
   given him the beasts of the field also.</span></quote>

  <verse>1</verse><span>Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent
  from Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders which were carried away
  captives, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people
  whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>(after that Jeconiah the king, and the queen, and the eunuchs, the
  princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the carpenters, and the smiths, were
  departed from Jerusalem)
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>By the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of
  Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to
  Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon) saying:
  </span><quote>
   <block>
    <verse>4</verse><span>Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, unto all that are
    carried away captives, whom I have caused to be carried away from
    Jerusalem unto Babylon:
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>Build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the
    fruit of them;
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for you
    sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and
    daughters; that ye may be increased there, and not diminished.
    </span><verse>7</verse><span>And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried
    away captives, and pray unto the LORD for it; for in the peace thereof
    shall ye have peace.
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: let not your
    prophets and your diviners, that be in the midst of you, deceive you,
    neither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed.
    </span><verse>9</verse><span>For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name. I have not sent them,
    saith the LORD.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>10</verse><span>For thus saith the LORD: That after seventy years be accomplished at
    Babylon I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you, in
    causing you to return to this place.
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD,
    thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>Then shall ye call unto me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I
    will hearken unto you.
    </span><verse>13</verse><span>And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all
    your heart.
    </span><verse>14</verse><span>And I will be found of you, saith the LORD; and I will turn away your
    captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the
    places whither I have driven you, saith the LORD; and I will bring you
    again into the place whence I caused you to be carried away
    captive.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>15</verse><span>Because ye have said, “The LORD hath raised us up prophets in Babylon;”
    </span><verse>16</verse><span>know
    that thus saith the LORD of the king that sitteth upon the throne of
    David, and of all the people that dwelleth in this city, and of your
    brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity;
    </span><verse>17</verse><span>thus saith the LORD of hosts: Behold, I will
    send upon them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make
    them like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.
    </span><verse>18</verse><span>And I will persecute them with the sword, with
    the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be removed
    to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, and an astonishment, and
    a hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations whither I have driven
    them;
    </span><verse>19</verse><span>because they have not hearkened to my
    words, saith the LORD, which I sent unto them by my servants the prophets,
    commanding them to rise early, and sending them; but ye would not hear,
    saith the LORD.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>20</verse><span>Hear ye therefore the word of the LORD, all ye of the captivity, whom I
    have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon;
    </span><verse>21</verse><span>thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, of Ahab the son of
    Kolaiah, and of Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, which prophesy a lie unto
    you in my name: Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of
    Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall slay them before your eyes;
    </span><verse>22</verse><span>and of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah
    which are in Babylon, saying, ‘The LORD make thee like Zedekiah and like
    Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire;’
    </span><verse>23</verse><span>because they have committed villainy in Israel, and have committed
    adultery with their neighbors’ wives, and have spoken lying words in my
    name, which I have not commanded them; even I know, and am a witness,
    saith the LORD.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>24</verse><span>Thus shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying:
    </span><verse>25</verse><span>Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying: Because
    thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people that are at
    Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all
    the priests, saying,
    </span><verse>26</verse><span>“The LORD hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest,
    that ye should be officers in the house of the LORD, for every man that
    is mad, and maketh himself a prophet, that thou shouldest put him in
    prison, and in the stocks.
    </span><verse>27</verse><span>Now therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth, which
    maketh himself a prophet to you?
    </span><verse>28</verse><span>For therefore he sent unto us in Babylon, saying, “This captivity is
    long; build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the
    fruit of them.’”</span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>29</verse><span>And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the

   </span><verse>32</verse><span>therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the
   Nehelamite, and his seed; he shall not have a man to dwell among this
   people; neither shall he behold the good that I will do for my people,

  <verse>1</verse><span>The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of
  Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>For then the king of Babylon’s army besieged Jerusalem; and Jeremiah
  the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison, which was in the
  king of Judah’s house.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, “Wherefore dost
  thou prophesy, and say, ‘Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will give this
  city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the
  Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of
  Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall
  behold his eyes;
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>and he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I
  visit him, saith the LORD; though ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye shall
  not prosper.’”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And Jeremiah said:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>
    The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
    </span><verse>7</verse><span>“Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum thine uncle
    shall come unto thee, saying, ‘Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth; for
    the right of redemption is thine to buy it.’
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>So
    Hanameel mine uncle’s son came to me in the court of the prison according
    to the word of the LORD, and said unto me, ‘Buy my field, I pray thee,
    that is in Anathoth, which is in the country of Benjamin; for the right of
    inheritance is thine, and the redemption is thine; buy it for thyself.’
    Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>9</verse><span>And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle’s son, that was in
    Anathoth, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver.
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed it, and took witnesses, and
    weighed him the money in the balances.
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>So I took the evidence of the purchase, both that which was sealed
    according to the law and custom, and that which was open;
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>and I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah,
    the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of
    Hanameel mine uncle’s son, and in the presence of the witnesses that
    subscribed the book of the purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the
    court of the prison.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>13</verse><span>And I charged Baruch before them saying,
    </span><verse>14</verse><span>“Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these evidences,
    this evidence of the purchase, both which is sealed, and this evidence
    which is open; and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may continue
    many days.
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Houses and fields
    and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>16</verse><span>Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the
    son of Neriah, I prayed unto the LORD, saying:</span><quote>
     <verse>17</verse><span>Ah Lord GOD! Behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy
     great power and stretched-out arm, and there is nothing too hard for
     thee;

     iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them; The
     Great, The Mighty God, The LORD of hosts, is his name;
     </span><verse>19</verse><span>great in counsel, and mighty in work; for thine eyes are open upon all
     the ways of the sons of men, to give everyone according to his ways, and
     according to the fruit of his doings;
     </span><verse>20</verse><span>which hast set signs and wonder in the land of Egypt, even unto this
     day, and in Israel, and among other men; and hast made thee a name, as
     at this day;
     </span><verse>21</verse><span>and hast brought forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with
     signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with a
     stretched-out arm, and with great terror;
     </span><verse>22</verse><span>and hast given them this land, which thou didst swear to their fathers
     to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;
     </span><verse>23</verse><span>and they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not thy voice,
     neither walked in thy law; they have done nothing of all that thou
     commandedest them to do; therefore thou hast caused all this evil to
     come upon them.</span></quote>
    <quote>
     <verse>24</verse><span>Behold the mounts, they are come unto the city to take it; and the city

     hast spoken is come to pass; and, behold, thou seest it.
     </span><verse>25</verse><span>And thou hast said unto me, O Lord GOD, “Buy thee the field for money,

    evil before me from their youth; for the children of Israel have only

    </span><verse>31</verse><span>For this city hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger and of my
    fury from the day that they built it even unto this day, that I should
    remove it from before my face;
    </span><verse>32</verse><span>because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children
    of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their
    kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of
    Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
    </span><verse>33</verse><span>And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face; though I
    taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not
    hearkened to receive instruction.
    </span><verse>34</verse><span>But they set their abominations in the house, which is called by my
    name, to defile it.
    </span><verse>35</verse><span>And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the
    son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters
    to pass through the fire unto Molech; which I commanded them not,
    neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to
    cause Judah to sin.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>36</verse><span>And now therefore thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning

    </span><verse>37</verse><span>behold, I will gather them out of all countries, whither I have driven
    them in mine anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring
    them again unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely;
    </span><verse>38</verse><span>and they shall be my people, and I will be their God;
    </span><verse>39</verse><span>and I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me
    forever, for the good of them, and of their children after them;
    </span><verse>40</verse><span>and I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn
    away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts,
    that they shall not depart from me.
    </span><verse>41</verse><span>Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in
    this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.</span></block>

    <verse>42</verse><span>For thus saith the LORD: Like as I have brought all this great evil

    promised them.
    </span><verse>43</verse><span>And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say, It is desolate
    without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.
    </span><verse>44</verse><span>Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe evidences, and seal them,

  saying:</span><quote>
   <verse>2</verse><span>Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words that I have
   spoken unto thee against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the

   I am shut up; I cannot go into the house of the LORD;
   </span><verse>6</verse><span>therefore go thou, and read in the roll, which
   thou hast written from my mouth, the words of the LORD in the ears of the
   people in the LORD’s house upon the fasting day; and also thou shalt read
   them in the ears of all Judah that come out of their cities.
   </span><verse>7</verse><span>It may be they will present their supplication

  </span><verse>10</verse><span>Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the

  </span><verse>11</verse><span>When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of

  Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and
  Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all
  the princes.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>Then Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard, when

  <verse>14</verse><span>Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of

  Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came unto them.

  <verse>16</verse><span>Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they were

  </span><verse>17</verse><span>And they asked Baruch, saying, “Tell us now, how didst thou write all
  these words at his mouth?”
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>Then Baruch answered them, “He pronounced all these words unto me with
  his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.”
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>Then said the princes unto Baruch, “Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah;

  </span><verse>23</verse><span>And it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, he
  cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was on the
  hearth, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was on the
  hearth.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the king,

  <verse>25</verse><span>Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to
  the king that he would not burn the roll; but he would not hear them.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the

  </span><quote><span>
   The LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place.
   </span><verse>3</verse><span>Now the LORD hath brought it, and done according
   as he hath said; because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not
   obeyed his voice, therefore this thing is come upon you.
   </span><verse>4</verse><span>And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the
   chains which were upon thine hand. If it seem good unto thee to come with
   me into Babylon, come; and I will look well unto thee; but if it seem ill
   unto thee to come with me into Babylon, forbear; behold, all the land is
   before thee; whither it seemeth good and convenient for thee to go,
   thither go.

  <verse>5</verse><span>Now while he was not yet gone back, he said, “Go back also to Gedaliah
  the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon hath made
  governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people;
  or go wheresoever it seemeth convenient unto thee to go.” So the captain
  of the guard gave him victuals and a reward, and let him go.

  <verse>6</verse><span>Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and dwelt
  with him among the people that were left in the land.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>Now when all the captains of the forces which were in the fields, even
  they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the
  son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed unto him men, and
  women, and children, and of the poor of the land, of them that were not
  carried away captive to Babylon;
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of
  Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the
  son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah
  the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto them and

   Fear not to serve the Chaldeans; dwell in the land, and serve the king of

   </span><verse>10</verse><span>As for
   me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to serve the Chaldeans, which will

  <verse>11</verse><span>Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the Ammonites,

  Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan;
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>even all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were driven,
  and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, unto Mizpah, and gathered

  <verse>13</verse><span>Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces

  </span><verse>14</verse><span>and said unto him, “Dost thou certainly know that Baalis the king of
  the Ammonites hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slay thee?” But
  Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>Then Johanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly,
  saying, “Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the son of

  all the Jews which are gathered unto thee should be scattered, and the

 <chapter>41

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of
  Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and the princes of the
  king, even ten men with him, came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to
  Mizpah; and there they did eat bread together in Mizpah.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with
  him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the
  sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the
  land.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, even with Gedaliah,
  at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there, and the men of
  war.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no
  man knew it,
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>that
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  there came certain from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even
  fourscore men, having their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and
  having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring
  them to the house of the LORD.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And Ishmael the
  son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as
  he went; and it came to pass, as he met them, he said unto them, “Come to
  Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.”
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And it was so, when
  they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah
  slew them, and cast them into the midst of the pit, he, and the men that
  were with him.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>But ten men were found among them
  that said unto Ishmael, “Slay us not; for we have treasures in the field,
  of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey.” So he forbare, and
  slew them not among their brethren.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>Now the pit
  wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men, whom he had slain
  because of Gedaliah, was it which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha
  king of Israel; and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with them that
  were slain.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that
  were in Mizpah, even the king’s daughters, and all the people that
  remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzar- adan the captain of the guard had
  committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam; and Ishmael the son of
  Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the
  Ammonites.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces
  that were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of
  Nethaniah had done,
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of
  Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>Now it came to pass, that when all the people which were with Ishmael
  saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that
  were with him, then they were glad.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah
  cast about and returned, and went unto Johanan the son of Kareah.

    Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: If ye wholly set your

    which ye feared, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt; and the

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>Against Egypt, against the army of Pharaoh-necho king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Charchemish, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah.</span><break></break>

  <verse>3</verse><span>Order ye the buckler and shield,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and draw near to battle.</span></indent>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Harness the horses;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and get up, ye horsemen,</span></indent><span>
  and stand forth with your helmets;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>furbish the spears, and put on the brigandines.</span></indent>
  <verse>5</verse><span>Wherefore have I seen them dismayed and turned away back?</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>And their mighty ones are beaten down,</span></indent><span>
  and are fled apace, and look not back;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>for fear was round about, saith the LORD.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>Let not the swift flee away,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>nor the mighty man escape;</span></indent><span>
  they shall stumble,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and fall toward the north by the river Euphrates.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>Who is this that cometh up as a flood,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>whose waters are moved as the rivers?</span></indent>
  <verse>8</verse><span>Egypt riseth up like a flood,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and his waters are moved like the rivers;</span></indent><span>
  and he saith, “I will go up, and will cover the earth;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>I will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof.”</span></indent>
  <verse>9</verse><span>Come up, ye horses;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and rage, ye chariots;</span></indent><span>
  and let the mighty men come forth;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the Ethiopians and the Libyans, that handle the shield;</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and the Lydians, that handle and bend the bow.</span></indent>
  <verse>10</verse><span>For this is the day of the LORD God of hosts,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>a day of vengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries;</span></indent><span>
  and the sword shall devour, and it shall be satiate and made drunk with their blood;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>for the LORD God of hosts hath a sacrifice in the north country by the river</span></indent>
  <indent><span>Euphrates.</span></indent>

  <verse>11</verse><span>Go up into Gilead, and take balm,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>O virgin, the daughter of Egypt;</span></indent><span>
  in vain shalt thou use many medicines;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>for thou shalt not be cured.</span></indent>
  <verse>12</verse><span>The nations have heard of thy shame,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and thy cry hath filled the land;</span></indent><span>

  <verse>13</verse><span>The word that the LORD spake to Jeremiah the prophet, how Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon should came and smite the land of Egypt.</span><break></break>

  <indent><span>and publish in Noph and in Tahpanhes;</span></indent><span>
  say ye, “Stand fast, and prepare thee;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>for the sword shall devour round about thee.”</span></indent>
  <verse>15</verse><span>Why are thy valiant men swept away?</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>They stood not, because the LORD did drive them.</span></indent>
  <verse>16</verse><span>He made many to fall,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>yea, one fell upon another;</span></indent><span>
  and they said, “Arise, and let us go again to our own people,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and to the land of our nativity, from the oppressing sword.”</span></indent>
  <verse>17</verse><span>They did cry there, “Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he hath passed the time appointed.”</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>As I live, saith the King,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>whose name is the LORD of hosts,</span></indent><span>
  Surely as Tabor is among the mountains,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and as Carmel by the sea, so shall he come.</span></indent>
  <verse>19</verse><span>O thou daughter dwelling in Egypt,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>furnish thyself to go into captivity;</span></indent><span>
  for Noph shall be waste and desolate</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>without an inhabitant.</span></indent>

  <verse>20</verse><span>Egypt is like a very fair heifer,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>but destruction cometh;</span></indent>
  <indent><span>it cometh out of the north.</span></indent>
  <verse>21</verse><span>Also her hired men are in the midst of her</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>like fatted bullocks;</span></indent><span>
  for they also are turned back, and are fled away together;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>they did not stand,</span></indent><span>
  because the day of their calamity was come upon them,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the time of their visitation.</span></indent>
  <verse>22</verse><span>The voice thereof shall go like a serpent;</span><break></break><span>
  for they shall march with an army,</span><break></break><span>
  and come against her with axes,</span><break></break><span>
  as hewers of wood.</span><break></break>
  <verse>23</verse><span>They shall cut down her forest, saith the LORD,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>though it cannot be searched;</span></indent><span>
  because they are more than the grasshoppers,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and are innumerable.</span></indent>
  <verse>24</verse><span>The daughter of Egypt shall be confounded;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north.</span></indent>

 <block>
  <verse>25</verse><span>The LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saith: Behold, I will punish the

  kings; even Pharaoh, and all them that trust in him;
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>and will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives, and
  into the hand of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants; and
  afterward it shall be inhabited, as in the days of old, saith the
  LORD.

 <block>
  <verse>27</verse><span>But fear not thou, O my servant Jacob,</span><break></break>

  <indent><span>and thy seed from the land of their captivity;</span></indent><span>
  and Jacob shall return, and be in rest and at ease,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and none shall make him afraid.</span></indent>
  <verse>28</verse><span>Fear thou not, O Jacob my servant, saith the LORD;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>for I am with thee;</span></indent><span>
  for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have driven thee;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>but I will not make a full end of thee,</span></indent><span>

 <chapter>47

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Philistines, before that Pharaoh smote Gaza.</span><break></break>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>Thus saith the LORD:</span><break></break><span>
  Behold, waters rise up out of the north,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and shall be an overflowing flood,</span></indent><span>
  and shall overflow the land, and all that is therein;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the city, and them that dwell therein;</span></indent><span>
  then the men shall cry,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and all the inhabitants of the land shall howl.</span></indent><span>
  ﻿</span><break></break>
  <verse>3</verse><span>At the noise of the stamping of the hooves of his strong horses,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>at the rushing of his chariots, and at the rumbling of his wheels,</span></indent><span>
  the father shall not look back to their children</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>for feebleness of hands;</span></indent>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Because of the day that cometh to spoil all the Philistines,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and to cut off from Tyrus and Zidon every helper that remaineth;</span></indent><span>
  for the LORD will spoil the Philistines,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the remnant of the country of Caphtor.</span></indent>
  <verse>5</verse><span>Baldness is come upon Gaza;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>Ashkelon is cut off with the remnant of their valley;</span></indent>
  <indent><span>how long wilt thou cut thyself?</span></indent>
  <verse>6</verse><span>O thou sword of the LORD,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>how long will it be ere thou be quiet?</span></indent><span>
  Put up thyself into thy scabbard,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>rest, and be still.</span></indent>
  <verse>7</verse><span>How can it be quiet,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>seeing the LORD hath given it a charge against Ashkelon,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and against the seashore? There hath he appointed it.</span></indent>

 <chapter>48
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Against Moab thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel:</span><break></break>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  Woe unto Nebo! For it is spoiled;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>Kiriathaim is confounded and taken;</span></indent>
  <indent><span>Misgab is confounded and dismayed.</span></indent>
  <verse>2</verse><span>There shall be no more praise of Moab;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>in Heshbon they have devised evil against it;</span></indent>
  <indent><span>“Come, and let us cut it off from being a nation.”</span></indent><span>
  Also thou shalt be cut down, O Madmen;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the sword shall pursue thee.</span></indent>
  <verse>3</verse><span>A voice of crying shall be from Horonaim,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>spoiling and great destruction.</span></indent>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Moab is destroyed;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.</span></indent>
  <verse>5</verse><span>For in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>for in the going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction.</span></indent>
  <verse>6</verse><span>Flee, save your lives,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and be like the heath in the wilderness.</span></indent>
  <verse>7</verse><span>For because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>thou shalt also be taken;</span></indent><span>
  and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>with his priests and his princes together.</span></indent>
  <verse>8</verse><span>And the spoiler shall come upon every city,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and no city shall escape;</span></indent><span>
  the valley also shall perish,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the plain shall be destroyed, as the LORD hath spoken.</span></indent>
  <verse>9</verse><span>Give wings unto Moab,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>that it may flee and get away;</span></indent><span>
  for the cities thereof shall be desolate,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>without any to dwell therein.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>Cursed be he that doeth the work of the LORD deceitfully,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>Moab hath been at ease from his youth,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and he hath settled on his lees,</span></indent><span>
  and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>neither hath he gone into captivity;</span></indent><span>
  therefore his taste remained in him,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and his scent is not changed.</span></indent>
  <verse>12</verse><span>Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>that I will send unto him wanderers, that shall cause him to wander,</span></indent><span>
  and shall empty his vessels,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and break their bottles.</span></indent>
  <verse>13</verse><span>And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>as the house of Israel was ashamed of Beth-El their confidence.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>How say ye, “We are mighty</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and strong men for the war?</span></indent>
  <verse>15</verse><span>Moab is spoiled, and gone up out of her cities,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter,”</span></indent>
  <indent><span>saith the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts.</span></indent>
  <verse>16</verse><span>The calamity of Moab is near to come,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and his affliction hasteth fast.</span></indent>
  <verse>17</verse><span>All ye that are about him, bemoan him;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and all ye that know his name,</span></indent><span>
  say, “How is the strong staff broken,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the beautiful rod!”</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>Thou daughter that dost inhabit Dibon, come down from thy glory,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and sit in thirst;</span></indent><span>
  for the spoiler of Moab shall come upon thee,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and he shall destroy thy strongholds.</span></indent>
  <verse>19</verse><span>O inhabitant of Aroer,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>stand by the way, and espy;</span></indent><span>
  ask him that fleeth, and her that escapeth,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and say, “What is done?”</span></indent>
  <verse>20</verse><span>Moab is confounded; for it is broken down;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>howl and cry;</span></indent><span>
  tell ye it in Arnon,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>that Moab is spoiled,</span></indent>
  <verse>21</verse><span>and judgment is come upon the plain country;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>upon Holon, and upon Jahazah, and upon Mephaath,</span></indent>
  <indent>
   <verse>22</verse><span>and upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Beth-Diblathaim,</span></indent>
  <indent>
   <verse>23</verse><span>and upon Kiriathaim, and upon Beth-Gamul, and upon Beth-Meon,</span></indent>
  <indent>
   <verse>24</verse><span>and upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near.</span></indent>
  <verse>25</verse><span>The horn of Moab is cut off,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and his arm is broken, saith the LORD.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>26</verse><span>Make ye him drunken;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>for he magnified himself against the LORD;</span></indent><span>
  Moab also shall wallow in his vomit,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and he also shall be in derision.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>27</verse><span>For was not Israel a derision unto thee?</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>Was he found among thieves?</span></indent><span>
  For since thou spakest of him,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>thou skippedst for joy.</span></indent>
  <verse>28</verse><span>O ye that dwell in Moab,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>leave the cities, and dwell in the rock,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and be like the dove that maketh her nest in the sides of the hole’s mouth.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>29</verse><span>We have heard the pride of Moab,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>(he is exceeding proud)</span></indent><span>
  his loftiness and his arrogancy, and his pride,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the haughtiness of his heart.</span></indent>
  <verse>30</verse><span>I know his wrath, saith the LORD; but it shall not be so;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>his lies shall not so effect it.</span></indent>
  <verse>31</verse><span>Therefore will I howl for Moab,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and I will cry out for all Moab;</span></indent>
  <indent><span>mine heart shall mourn for the men of Kir-heres.</span></indent>
  <verse>32</verse><span>O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>with the weeping of Jazer;</span></indent><span>
  thy plants are gone over the sea,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>they reach even to the sea of Jazer;</span></indent><span>
  the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and upon thy vintage.</span></indent>
  <verse>33</verse><span>And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and from the land of Moab;</span></indent><span>
  and I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>none shall tread with shouting;</span></indent>
  <indent><span>their shouting shall be no shouting.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>34</verse><span>From the cry of Heshbon even unto Elealeh,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and even unto Jahaz, have they uttered their voice,</span></indent><span>
  from Zoar even unto Horonaim, as a heifer of three years old;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>for the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate.</span></indent>
  <verse>35</verse><span>Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith the LORD, him that offereth in the high places,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and him that burneth incense to his gods.</span></indent>
  <verse>36</verse><span>Therefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and mine heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kir-heres;</span></indent>
  <indent><span>because the riches that he hath gotten are perished.</span></indent>
  <verse>37</verse><span>For every head shall be bald,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and every beard clipped;</span></indent><span>
  upon all the hands shall be cuttings,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and upon the loins sackcloth.</span></indent>
  <verse>38</verse><span>There shall be lamentation generally upon all the housetops of Moab,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and in the streets thereof;</span></indent><span>
  for I have broken Moab like a vessel</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>wherein is no pleasure, saith the LORD.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>39</verse><span>They shall howl, saying, “How is it broken down!</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>How hath Moab turned the back with shame!”</span></indent><span>
  So shall Moab be a derision</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and a dismaying to all them about him.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>40</verse><span>For thus saith the LORD:</span><break></break><span>
  Behold, he shall fly as an eagle,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and shall spread his wings over Moab.</span></indent>
  <verse>41</verse><span>Kerioth is taken,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the strongholds are surprised,</span></indent><span>
  and the mighty men’s hearts in Moab at that day</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.</span></indent>
  <verse>42</verse><span>And Moab shall be destroyed from being a people,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>because he hath magnified himself against the LORD.</span></indent>
  <verse>43</verse><span>Fear, and the pit, and the snare, shall be upon thee,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>O inhabitant of Moab, saith the LORD.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>44</verse><span>He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare;</span></indent><span>
  for I will bring upon it, even upon Moab,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the year of their visitation, saith the LORD.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>45</verse><span>They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>because of the force;</span></indent><span>
  but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and a flame from the midst of Sihon,</span></indent><span>
  and shall devour the corner of Moab,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.</span></indent>
  <verse>46</verse><span>Woe be unto thee, O Moab!</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>The people of Chemosh perisheth;</span></indent><span>
  for thy sons are taken captives,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and thy daughters captives.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>47</verse><span>Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>in the latter days, saith the LORD.</span></indent>

  Thus far is the judgment of Moab.</span><break></break>

  Why then doth their king inherit Gad,</span><break></break>

  <verse>2</verse><span>Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD,</span><break></break>

  <verse>5</verse><span>Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the LORD God of hosts,</span><break></break>

  Is wisdom no more in Teman?</span><break></break>

  <verse>8</verse><span>Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep,</span><break></break>

  <indent><span>his seed is spoiled, and his brethren, and his neighbors, and he is not.</span></indent>
  <verse>11</verse><span>Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve them alive;</span><break></break>

  <verse>59</verse><span>The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of

  Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And this Seraiah was
  quiet prince.
  </span><verse>60</verse><span>So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon,
  even all these words that are written against Babylon.
  </span><verse>61</verse><span>And Jeremiah said to Seraiah:
  </span><quote><span>
   When thou comest to Babylon, and shalt see, and shalt read all these
   words;
   </span><verse>62</verse><span>then shalt thou say, ‘O Lord, thou hast
   spoken against this place, to cut it off, that none shall remain in it,
   neither man nor beast, but that it shall be desolate forever.’
   </span><verse>63</verse><span>And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of
   reading this book, that thou shalt bind a
   stone to it, and cast it into the midst of Euphrates;
   </span><verse>64</verse><span>and thou shalt say, ‘Thus shall Babylon sink,
   and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon her; and they
   shall be weary.’

  The fall of Jerusalem
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>52
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he
  reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Hamutal the
  daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD, according to
  all that Jehoiakim had done.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and
  Judah, till he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah
  rebelled against the king of Babylon.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month,
  in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came,
  he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it, and
  built forts against it round about.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And in the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was
  sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and went
  forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two
  walls, which was by the king’s garden; (now the Chaldeans were by the
  city round about) and they went by the way of the plain.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook
  Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from
  him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to
  Riblah in the land of Hamath; where he gave judgment upon him.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes; he
  slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him
  in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the
  day of his death.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the
  nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzar-adan,
  captain of the guard, which served the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem,
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>and burned the house of the LORD, and the king’s house; and all the
  houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the great men, burned he with
  fire;
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>and all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the
  guard, brake down all the walls of Jerusalem round about.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>Then Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away captive certain
  of the poor of the people, and the residue of the people that remained
  in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon,
  and the rest of the multitude.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>But Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard left certain of the poor of
  the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>Also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the
  bases, and the brazen sea that was in the house of the LORD, the
  Chaldeans brake, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls,
  and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered,
  took they away.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And the basins, and the firepans, and the bowls, and the caldrons, and
  the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups; that which was of gold
  in gold, and that which was of silver in silver, took the captain of the
  guard away.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brazen bulls that were under the
  bases, which king Solomon had made in the house of the LORD; the brass
  of all these vessels was without weight.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>And concerning the pillars, the height
  of one pillar was eighteen cubits; and a fillet of twelve cubits did
  compass it; and the thickness thereof was four fingers; it was hollow.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>And a chapiter of brass was upon it; and the
  height of one chapiter was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon
  the chapiters round about, all of brass. The second pillar also and the
  pomegranates were like unto these.
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>And there
  were ninety and six pomegranates on a side; and all the pomegranates upon
  the network were a hundred round about.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and
  Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door;
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>he took also out of the city a eunuch, which had the charge of the men
  of war; and seven men of them that were near the king’s person, which
  were found in the city; and the principal scribe of the host, who
  mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the
  land, that were found in the midst of the city.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>So Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to
  the king of Babylon to Riblah.
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in Riblah in
  the land of Hamath.
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  Thus Judah was carried away captive out of his own land.
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried
  away captive: In the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and
  twenty.
  </span><verse>29</verse><span>In the eighteenth year of
  Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty
  and two persons.
  </span><verse>30</verse><span>In the three and twentieth
  year of Nebuchadrezzar, Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away
  captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons. All the persons
  were four thousand and six hundred.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>
  Jehoiachin released
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>31</verse><span>And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of
  Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and
  twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon, in the
  first year of his reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah,
  and brought him forth out of prison,
  </span><verse>32</verse><span>and spake kindly unto him, and set his throne above the throne of the
  kings that were with him in Babylon.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>33</verse><span>And changed his prison garments; and he did continually eat bread
  before him all the days of his life.
  </span><verse>34</verse><span>And for his diet, there was a continual diet given him of the king of
  Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of
  his life.

  God’s anger over Jerusalem

 <chapter>2
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>How hath the LORD covered the daughter of Zion</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>with a cloud in his anger,</span></indent><span>
  and cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger!</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>The LORD hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and hath not pitied;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he hath thrown down in his wrath the strongholds of the daughter of Judah;</span></indent><span>
  he hath brought them down to the ground;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he hath polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>He hath cut off in his fierce anger all the horn of Israel;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy,</span></indent><span>
  and he burned against Jacob like a flaming fire,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>which devoureth round about.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>He hath bent his bow like an enemy;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he stood with his right hand as an adversary,</span></indent><span>
  and slew all that were pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he poured out his fury like fire.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>The LORD was as an enemy;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he hath swallowed up Israel,</span></indent><span>
  he hath swallowed up all her palaces;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he hath destroyed his strongholds,</span></indent><span>
  and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.</span><break></break>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were of a garden;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he hath destroyed his places of the assembly;</span></indent><span>
  the LORD hath caused the solemn feasts and Sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>The LORD hath cast off his altar,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he hath abhorred his sanctuary,</span></indent><span>
  he hath given up into the hand of the enemy</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the walls of her palaces;</span></indent><span>
  they have made a noise in the house of the LORD,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>as in the day of a solemn feast.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>The LORD hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he hath stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying;</span></indent><span>
  therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>they languished together.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>Her gates are sunk into the ground;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he hath destroyed and broken her bars;</span></indent><span>
  her king and her princes are among the Gentiles;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the law is no more;</span></indent><span>
  her prophets also find no vision from the LORD.</span><break></break>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, and keep silence;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>they have cast up dust upon their heads;</span></indent><span>
  they have girded themselves with sackcloth;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>Mine eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>my liver is poured upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people;</span></indent><span>
  because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city.</span><break></break>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>They say to their mothers,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>“Where is corn and wine?”</span></indent><span>

  <indent><span>when their soul was poured out into their mothers’ bosom.</span></indent>

  <verse>13</verse><span>What thing shall I take to witness for thee?</span><break></break>

  <verse>14</verse><span>Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee;</span><break></break>

  <indent><span>but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment.</span></indent>

  <verse>15</verse><span>All that pass by clap their hands at thee;</span><break></break>

  <indent><span>the joy of the whole earth?”</span></indent>

  <verse>16</verse><span>All thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee;</span><break></break>

  <verse>17</verse><span>The LORD hath done that which he had devised;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he hath fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old;</span></indent><span>
  he hath thrown down, and hath not pitied;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and he hath caused thine enemy to rejoice over thee,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>he hath set up the horn of thine adversaries.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>Their heart cried unto the LORD, O wall of the daughter of Zion,</span><break></break>

  that faint for hunger in the top of every street.</span><break></break>

  <verse>2</verse><span>He hath led me,</span><break></break>

  <verse>4</verse><span>My flesh and my skin hath he made old;</span><break></break>

  Ezekiel’s vision
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>1
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the
  fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river of
  Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king
  Jehoiachin’s captivity,
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>the
  word of the LORD came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi,
  in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD
  was there upon him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great
  cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and
  out of the midst thereof as the color of amber, out of the midst of the
  fire.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living
  creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a
  man.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like
  the sole of a calf’s foot; and they sparkled like the color of burnished
  brass.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides;
  and they four had their faces and their wings.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went;
  they went every one straight forward.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man,
  and the face of a lion, on the right side; and they four had the face of
  an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>Thus were their faces; and their wings were stretched upward; two wings
  of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And they went every one straight forward; whither the spirit was to go,
  they went; and they turned not when they went.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like
  burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps; it went up and
  down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the
  fire went forth lightning.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash
  of lightning.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth
  by the living creatures, with his four faces.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the color of
  a beryl; and they four had one likeness; and their appearance and their
  work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>When they went, they went upon their four sides; and they turned not
  when they went.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and
  their rings were full of eyes round about them four.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them; and when
  the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were
  lifted up.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their spirit
  to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them; for the spirit
  of the living creature was in the wheels.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and
  when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over
  against them; for the spirit of the living creature was in the
  wheels.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature
  was as the color of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their
  heads above.
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the
  other; every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had
  two, which covered on that side, their bodies.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of
  great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the
  noise of a host; when they stood, they let down their wings.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads,
  when they stood, and had let down their wings.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>26</verse><span>And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a
  throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone; and upon the likeness of
  the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>And I saw as the color of amber, as the appearance of fire round about
  within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the
  appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance
  of fire, and it had brightness round about.
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain,
  so was the appearance of the brightness round about.
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when
  I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.

  <verse>1</verse><span>And he said unto me:</span><quote><span>
   Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak unto thee.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>And the Spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon
  my feet, that I heard him that spake unto me.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And he said unto me:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious
   nation that hath rebelled against me; they and their fathers have
   transgressed against me, even unto this very day.
    </span><verse>4</verse><span>For they are impudent children and
    stiff-hearted. I do send thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them,
    “Thus saith the Lord GOD.”
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>And they, whether
    they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious
    house) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>6</verse><span>And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their
    words, though briers and thorns be with thee, and thou dost dwell among
    scorpions; be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks,
    though they be a rebellious house.
    </span><verse>7</verse><span>And thou shalt speak my words unto them whether they will hear, or
    whether they will forbear; for they are most rebellious.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>8</verse><span>But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee. Be not thou rebellious
    like that rebellious house; open thy mouth, and eat that I give
    thee.</span></block>

  </quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>And when I looked, behold, a hand was sent unto me; and lo, a roll of a
  book was therein;
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>and he spread it before me; and it was written within and without; and
  there was written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.
 </span></block>

 <chapter>3
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Moreover he said unto me:</span><quote><span>
   Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat this roll, and go speak unto the
   house of Israel.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And he said unto me:</span><quote><span>
   Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll
   that I give thee.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And he said unto me:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>Son of man, go, get thee
   unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>For thou art not sent to a people of a strange
    speech and of a hard language, but to the house of Israel;
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>not to many people of a strange speech and of a
    hard
    language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee
    to them, they would have hearkened unto thee.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>7</verse><span>But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not
    hearken unto me; for all the house of Israel are impudent and
    hardhearted.
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy
    forehead strong against their foreheads.
    </span><verse>9</verse><span>As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead; fear them
    not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious
    house.</span></block>

  </quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>Moreover he said unto me:</span><quote><span>
   Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine
   heart, and hear with thine ears.
   </span><verse>11</verse><span>And go, get
   thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak
   unto them, and tell them, “Thus saith the Lord GOD;” whether they will
   hear, or whether they will forbear.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>Then the Spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great
  rushing, saying, “Blessed be the glory of the LORD from his place.”
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that
  touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and
  a noise of a great rushing.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>So the Spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness,
  in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon
  me.

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-Abab, that dwelt by the
  river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished
  among them seven days.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD
  came unto me, saying:
  </span><quote>
   <block>
    <verse>17</verse><span>Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel;
    therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.
    </span><verse>18</verse><span>When I say unto the wicked, “Thou shalt surely die;” and thou givest
    him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to
    save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his
    blood will I require at thine hand.
    </span><verse>19</verse><span>Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor
    from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast
    delivered thy soul.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>20</verse><span>Again, when a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and
    commit iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he shall die;
    because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and
    his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his
    blood will I require at thine hand.
    </span><verse>21</verse><span>Nevertheless, if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin
    not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned;
    also thou hast delivered thy soul.</span></block>

  <verse>22</verse><span>And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said unto me: Arise,

  <verse>23</verse><span>Then I arose, and went forth into the plain; and, behold, the glory of
  the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar;
  and I fell on my face.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>Then the Spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spake

   <block><span>
    Go, shut thyself within thine house.
    </span><verse>25</verse><span>But thou,

  <verse>1</verse><span>And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:
  </span><quote>
   <block>
    <verse>2</verse><span>Son of man, set thy face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy
    against them,
    </span><verse>3</verse><span>and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD. Thus
    saith the Lord GOD to the mountains and to the hills, to the rivers, and
    to the valleys:</span></block>

   <block><span>Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your
   high places.
    </span><verse>4</verse><span>And your altars shall be desolate, and your
    images shall be broken; and I will cast down your slain men before your
    idols.
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>And I will lay the dead carcasses of the
    children of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your bones round
    about your altars.
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>In all your dwelling places
    the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate;
    that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may
    be broken and cease, and your images may be cut down, and your works may
    be abolished.
    </span><verse>7</verse><span>And the slain shall fall in the
    midst of you, and ye shall know that I am the LORD.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>8</verse><span>Yet will I leave a remnant, that ye may have some that shall escape the
    sword among the nations, when ye shall be scattered through the
    countries.
    </span><verse>9</verse><span>And they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations whither
    they shall be carried captives, because I am broken with their whorish
    heart, which hath departed from me, and with their eyes, which go a
    whoring after their idols; and they shall loathe themselves for the
    evils which they have committed in all their abominations.
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>And they shall know that I am the LORD, and that I have not said in
    vain that I would do this evil unto them.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>11</verse><span>Thus saith the Lord GOD: Smite with thine hand, and stamp with thy
    foot, and say, “Alas for all the evil abominations of the house of
    Israel!” For they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the
    pestilence.
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>He that is far off shall die of the pestilence; and he that is near
    shall fall by the sword; and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die
    by the famine; thus will I accomplish my fury upon them.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>13</verse><span>Then shall ye know that I am the LORD, when their slain men shall be
    among their idols round about their altars, upon every high hill, in all
    the tops of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every
    thick oak, the place where they did offer sweet savor to all their
    idols.
    </span><verse>14</verse><span>So will I stretch out my hand upon them, and make the land desolate,
    yea, more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblath, in all their
    habitations; and they shall know that I am the LORD.</span></block>

  Idolatry in the temple

 <chapter>8
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth
  day of the month, as I sat in mine house, and the elders of Judah sat
  before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell there upon me.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>Then I beheld, and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire; from the
  appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from his loins even
  upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the color of amber.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And he put forth the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of mine
  head; and the Spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and
  brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner
  gate that looketh toward the north; where was the seat of the image of
  jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the
  vision that I saw in the plain.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>Then said he unto me:</span><quote><span>
   Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north. So I lifted
   up mine eyes the way toward the north, and behold northward at the gate of
   the altar this image of jealousy in the entry.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>He said furthermore unto me:</span><quote><span>
   Son of man, seest thou what they do? Even the great abominations that the
   house of Israel committeth here, that I should go far off from my
   sanctuary? But turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater
   abominations.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold a
  hole in the wall.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>Then said he unto me, “Son of man, dig now in the wall.” And when I had
  digged in the wall, behold a door.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>And he said unto me, “Go in, and behold the wicked abominations that
  they do here.”
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>So I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping things, and
  abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed
  upon the wall round about.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of
  Israel, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan,
  with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went
  up.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>Then said he unto me:</span><quote><span>
   Son of man, hast thou seen what the ancients of the house of Israel do in
   the dark, every man in the chambers of his imagery? For they say, ‘The
   LORD seeth us not; the LORD hath forsaken the earth.’
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>He said also unto me:</span><quote><span>
   Turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations that they do.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD’s house which
  was toward the north; and, behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>Then said he unto me:</span><quote><span>
   Hast thou seen this, O son of man? Turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see
   greater abominations than these.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>And he brought me into the inner court of the LORD’s house, and,
  behold, at the door of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the
  altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the
  temple of the LORD, and their faces toward the east; and they worshiped
  the sun toward the east.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>Then he said unto me:</span><quote><span>
   Hast thou seen this, O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of
   Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here? For they
   have filled the land with violence, and have returned to provoke me to
   anger; and, lo, they put the branch to their nose.
   </span><verse>18</verse><span>Therefore will I also deal in fury; mine eye
   shall not spare, neither will I have pity; and though they cry in mine
   ears with a loud voice, yet will I not hear them.

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>He cried also in mine ears with a loud voice, saying:</span><quote><span>
   Cause them that have charge over the city to draw near, even every man
   with his destroying weapon in his hand.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>And, behold, six men came from the way of the higher gate, which lieth
  toward the north, and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand; and one
  man among them was clothed with linen, with a writer’s inkhorn by his
  side; and they went in, and stood beside the brazen altar.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>And the glory of God of Israel was gone up from the cherub, whereupon
  he was, to the threshold of the house. And he called to the man clothed
  with linen, which had the writer’s inkhorn by his side;
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>And the LORD said unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through
  the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men
  that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the
  midst thereof.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And to the others he said in mine hearing:</span><quote><span>
   Go ye after him through the city, and smite; let not your eye spare,
   neither have ye pity.
   </span><verse>6</verse><span>Slay utterly old and
   young, both maids, and little children, and women; but come not near any
   man upon whom is the mark; and begin at my sanctuary.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>Then they began at the ancient men which were before the house.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And he said unto them, “Defile the house, and
  fill the courts with the slain; go ye forth.” And they went forth, and
  slew in the city.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>And it came to pass, while
  they were slaying them, and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and
  cried, and said, “Ah Lord GOD! Wilt thou destroy all the residue of Israel
  in thy pouring out of thy fury upon Jerusalem?”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>Then said he unto me:</span><quote><span>
   The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceeding great, and the
   land is full of blood, and the city full of perverseness; for they say,
   ‘The LORD hath forsaken the earth, and the LORD seeth not.’
   </span><verse>10</verse><span>And as for me also, mine eye shall not spare,
   neither will I have pity, but I will recompense their way upon their head.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>And, behold, the man clothed with linen, which had the inkhorn by his
  side, reported the matter, saying, “I have done as thou hast commanded

 <chapter>10
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the head of
  the cherubim there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as
  the appearance of the likeness of a throne.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and said, “Go in between
  the wheels, even under the cherub, and fill thine hand with coals of
  fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city.” And he
  went in in my sight.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>Now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house, when the man
  went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub, and stood over the
  threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the
  court was full of the brightness of the LORD’s glory.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And the sound of the cherubim’s wings was heard even to the outer
  court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And it came to pass, that when he had commanded the man clothed with
  linen, saying, “Take fire from between the wheels, from between the
  cherubim;” then he went in, and stood beside the wheels.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim unto
  the fire that was between the cherubim, and took thereof, and put it
  into the hands of him that was clothed with linen; who took it, and went
  out.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>And there appeared in the cherubim the form of a man’s hand under their
  wings.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubim, one wheel by
  one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub, and the appearance of
  the wheels was as the color of a beryl stone.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And as for their appearances, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel
  had been in the midst of a wheel.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not as
  they went, but to the place whither the head looked, they followed it;
  they turned not as they went.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their
  wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about, even the wheels
  that they four had.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>As for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, “O wheel.”
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And everyone had four faces; the first face was the face of a cherub,
  and the second face was the face of a man, and the third the face of a
  lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And the cherubim were lifted up. This is the living creature that I saw
  by the river of Chebar.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And when the cherubim went, the wheels went by them; and when the
  cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the same
  wheels also turned not from beside them.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>When they stood, these stood; and when they were lifted up, these
  lifted up themselves also; for the spirit of the living creature was in
  them.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>Then the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshold of the
  house, and stood over the cherubim.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And the cherubim lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth
  in my sight; when they went out, the wheels also were beside them, and
  every one stood at the door of the east gate of the LORD’s house; and
  the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the
  river of Chebar; and I knew that they were the cherubim.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>Every one had four faces apiece, and every one four wings; and the
  likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>And the likeness of their faces was the same faces which I saw by the
  river of Chebar, their appearances and themselves; they went every one
  straight forward.

  <verse>1</verse><span>Moreover the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate of

   Son of man, these are the men that devise mischief, and give wicked

    Lord GOD.
    </span><verse>9</verse><span>And I will bring you out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into the
    hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of Israel;
    and ye shall know that I am the LORD.
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>This city shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the flesh in
    the midst thereof; but I will judge you in the border of Israel;

    </span><verse>3</verse><span>Thus saith the Lord GOD: Woe unto the foolish prophets, that follow

    </span><verse>4</verse><span>O Israel, thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts.
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for the
    house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the LORD.
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, ‘The LORD saith;’

    </span><verse>10</verse><span>Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, ‘Peace;’ and
    there was no peace; and one built up a wall, and, lo, others daubed it

   <block>
    <verse>20</verse><span>Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD: Behold, I am against your pillows,

    to make them fly.
    </span><verse>21</verse><span>Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of your

    know that I am the LORD.
    </span><verse>22</verse><span>Because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom I
    have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he
    should not return from his wicked way, by promising him life;

    these things, the work of an imperious whorish woman;
    </span><verse>31</verse><span>in that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way, and
    makest thine high pace in every street; and hast not been as a harlot,
    in that thou scornest hire;
    </span><verse>32</verse><span>but as a wife that committeth adultery, which taketh strangers instead
    of her husband!
    </span><verse>33</verse><span>They give gifts to all whores; but thou givest thy gifts to all thy
    lovers, and hirest them, that they may come unto thee on every side for
    thy whoredom.
    </span><verse>34</verse><span>And the contrary is in thee from other women in thy whoredoms, whereas
    none followeth thee to commit whoredoms; and in that thou givest a
    reward, and no reward is given unto thee, therefore thou art
    contrary.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>35</verse><span>Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD;
    </span><verse>36</verse><span>thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thy filthiness was poured out, and thy
    nakedness discovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers, and with all
    the idols of thy abominations, and by the blood of thy children, which
    thou didst give unto them;
    </span><verse>37</verse><span>behold, therefore I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou hast
    taken pleasure, and all them that thou hast loved, with all them that
    thou hast hated; I will even gather them round about against thee, and
    will discover thy nakedness unto them, that they may see all thy
    nakedness.
    </span><verse>38</verse><span>And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are
    judged; and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy.
    </span><verse>39</verse><span>And I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down
    thine eminent place, and shall break down thy high places; they shall
    strip thee also of thy clothes, and shall take thy fair jewels, and
    leave thee naked and bare.
    </span><verse>40</verse><span>They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall stone
    thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords.
    </span><verse>41</verse><span>And they shall burn thine houses with fire, and execute judgments upon
    thee in the sight of many women; and I will cause thee to cease from
    playing the harlot, and thou also shalt give no hire anymore.
    </span><verse>42</verse><span>So will I make my fury toward thee to rest, and my jealousy shall
    depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>43</verse><span>Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast
    fretted me in all these things; behold, therefore I also will recompense
    thy way upon thine head, saith the Lord GOD; and thou shalt not commit
    this lewdness above all thine abominations.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>44</verse><span>Behold, everyone that useth proverbs shall use this proverb against
    thee, saying, ‘As is the mother, so is her daughter.’
    </span><verse>45</verse><span>Thou art thy mother’s daughter, that loatheth her husband and her
    children; and thou art the sister of thy sisters, which loathed their
    husbands and their children; your mother was a Hittite, and your father
    an Amorite.
    </span><verse>46</verse><span>And thine elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that dwell at
    thy left hand; and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand,
    is Sodom and her daughters.
    </span><verse>47</verse><span>Yet hast thou not walked after their ways, nor done after their
    abominations; but, as if that were a very little thing, thou wast
    corrupted more than they in all thy ways.
    </span><verse>48</verse><span>As I live, saith the Lord GOD, Sodom thy sister hath not done, she nor
    her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>49</verse><span>Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fullness of
    bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters,
    neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.
    </span><verse>50</verse><span>And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me; therefore I
    took them away, as I saw good.
    </span><verse>51</verse><span>Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast
    multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast justified thy
    sisters in all thine abominations which thou hast done.
    </span><verse>52</verse><span>Thou also, which hast judged thy sisters, bear thine own shame for thy
    sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they; they are more
    righteous than thou; yea, be thou confounded also, and bear thy shame in
    that thou hast justified thy sisters.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>53</verse><span>When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and
    her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then will
    I bring again the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them;
    </span><verse>54</verse><span>that thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be confounded in all
    that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them.
    </span><verse>55</verse><span>When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former
    estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former
    estate, then thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate.
    </span><verse>56</verse><span>For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy
    pride,
    </span><verse>57</verse><span>before thy wickedness was discovered, as at the time of thy reproach of
    the daughters of Syria, and all that are round about her, the daughters
    of the Philistines, which despise thee round about.
    </span><verse>58</verse><span>Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith the
    LORD.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>59</verse><span>For thus saith the Lord GOD: I will even deal with thee as thou hast
    done, which hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant.
    </span><verse>60</verse><span>Nevertheless, I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy
    youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant.
    </span><verse>61</verse><span>Then thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt
    receive thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger; and I will give them
    unto thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant.
    </span><verse>62</verse><span>And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I
    am the LORD;
    </span><verse>63</verse><span>that thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth
    anymore because of thy shame, when I am pacified toward thee for all
    that thou hast done, saith the Lord GOD.</span></block>

  <verse>1</verse><span>And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:

   <block>
    <verse>2</verse><span>Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable unto the house of
    Israel;
    </span><verse>3</verse><span>and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD: A great eagle with great wings, long
    winged, full of feathers, which had divers colors, came unto Lebanon,
    and took the highest branch of the cedar.
    </span><verse>4</verse><span>He cropped off the top of his young twigs, and carried it into a land
    of traffic; he set it in a city of merchants.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>5</verse><span>He took also the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful field;
    he placed it by great waters, and set it as a willow tree.
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches
    turned toward him, and the roots thereof were under him; so it became a
    vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>7</verse><span>There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers;
    and, behold, this vine did bend her roots toward him, and shot forth her
    branches toward him, that he might water it by the furrows of her
    plantation.
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>It was planted in a good soil by
    great waters, that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear
    fruit, that it might be a goodly vine.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>9</verse><span>Say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD: Shall it prosper? Shall he not pull
    up the roots thereof, and cut off the fruit thereof, that it wither? It
    shall wither in all the leaves of her spring, even without great power
    or many people to pluck it up by the roots thereof.
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>Yea, behold, being planted, shall it prosper? Shall it not utterly
    wither, when the east wind toucheth it? It shall wither in the furrows
    where it grew.</span></block>

  <verse>11</verse><span>Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:

    <verse>12</verse><span>Say now to the rebellious house, know ye not what these things mean?
    Tell them, Behold, the king of Babylon is come to Jerusalem, and hath
    taken the king thereof, and the princes thereof, and led them with him
    to Babylon.
    </span><verse>13</verse><span>And hath taken of the king’s seed, and made a covenant with him, and
    hath taken an oath of him; he hath also taken the mighty of the land;
    </span><verse>14</verse><span>that the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up, but
    that be keeping of his covenant it might stand.
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that
    they might give him horses and much people. Shall he prosper? Shall he
    escape that doeth such things? Or shall he break the covenant, and be
    delivered?</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>16</verse><span>As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely in the place where the king
    dwelleth that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant
    he brake, even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die.
    </span><verse>17</verse><span>Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company make for
    him in the war, by casting up mounts, and building forts, to cut off
    many persons;
    </span><verse>18</verse><span>seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when, lo, he had
    given his hand, and hath done all these things, he shall not
    escape.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>19</verse><span>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD: As I live, surely mine oath that he
    hath despised, and my covenant that he hath broken, even it will I
    recompense upon his own head.
    </span><verse>20</verse><span>And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare,
    and I will bring him to Babylon, and will plead with him there for his
    trespass that he hath trespassed against me.
    </span><verse>21</verse><span>And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword, and
    they that remain shall be scattered toward all winds; and ye shall know

    <verse>22</verse><span>Thus saith the Lord GOD: I will also take of the highest branch of the

    twigs a tender one, and will plant it upon a high mountain and eminent.
    </span><verse>23</verse><span>In the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it; and it shall
    bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar; and under it
    shall dwell all fowl of every wing; in the shadow of the branches
    thereof shall they dwell.
    </span><verse>24</verse><span>And all the trees of the field shall know that I the LORD have brought

    not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they
    forsake the idols of Egypt; then I said, ‘I will pour out my fury upon
    them, to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of
    Egypt.’
    </span><verse>9</verse><span>But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted before
    the heathen, among whom they were, in whose sight I made myself known
    unto them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>Wherefore I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and
    brought them into the wilderness.
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>And I gave them my statutes, and showed them my judgments, which if a
    man do, he shall even live in them.
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>Moreover also I gave them my Sabbaths, to be a sign between me and

    <verse>13</verse><span>But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness; they

    polluted; then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them in the

    </span><verse>14</verse><span>But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted before

    not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk
    and honey, which is the glory of all lands;

    polluted my Sabbaths; for their heart went after their idols.

    make an end of them in the wilderness.
    </span><verse>18</verse><span>But I said unto their children in the wilderness, ‘Walk ye not in the

    </span><verse>22</verse><span>Nevertheless I withdrew mine hand, and wrought for my name’s sake, that

    scatter them among the heathen, and disperse them through the countries;
    </span><verse>24</verse><span>because they had not executed my judgments, but had despised my
    statutes, and had polluted my Sabbaths, and their eyes were after their
    fathers’ idols.
    </span><verse>25</verse><span>Wherefore I gave them also statutes that were not good, and judgments
    whereby they should not live;
    </span><verse>26</verse><span>and I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass

    <verse>2</verse><span>Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother;

    their youth; there were their breasts pressed, and there they bruised
    the teats of their virginity.
    </span><verse>4</verse><span>And the names of them were Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her sister;

    their heads, all of them princes to look to, after the manner of the
    Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity;
    </span><verse>16</verse><span>and as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them, and
    sent messengers unto them into Chaldea.
    </span><verse>17</verse><span>And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled
    her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her mind
    was alienated from me by them.
    </span><verse>18</verse><span>So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness; then my
    mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated from her
    sister.
    </span><verse>19</verse><span>Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance the days of
    her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.
    </span><verse>20</verse><span>For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of
    asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.
    </span><verse>21</verse><span>Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in
    bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy youth.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>22</verse><span>Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord GOD: Behold, I will raise up
    thy lovers against thee, by whom thy mind is alienated from me, and I
    will bring them against thee on every side;
    </span><verse>23</verse><span>the Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, and
    all the Assyrians with them; all of them desirable young men, captains
    and rulers, great lords and renowned, all of them riding upon horses.
    </span><verse>24</verse><span>And they shall come against thee with chariots,
    wagons, and wheels, and with an assembly of people, which shall set
    against thee buckler and shield and helmet round about; and I will set
    judgment before them, and they shall judge thee according to their
    judgments.
    </span><verse>25</verse><span>And I will set my jealousy against
    thee, and they shall deal furiously with thee; they shall take away thy
    nose and thine ears; and thy remnant shall fall by the sword; they shall
    take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the
    fire.
    </span><verse>26</verse><span>They shall also strip thee out of thy
    clothes, and take away thy fair jewels.
    </span><verse>27</verse><span>Thus
    will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy whoredom brought from
    the land of Egypt; so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them,
    nor remember Egypt anymore.
   </span></block>

    labor, and shall leave thee naked and bare; and the nakedness of thy
    whoredoms shall be discovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.
    </span><verse>30</verse><span>I will do these things unto thee, because thou hast gone a whoring
    after the heathen, and because thou art polluted with their idols.
    </span><verse>31</verse><span>Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give her
    cup into thine hand.</span></block>

    Thou shalt drink of thy sister’s cup deep and large;</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision;</span></indent>
    <indent><span>it containeth much.</span></indent>
    <verse>33</verse><span>Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>with the cup of astonishment and desolation,</span></indent>
    <indent><span>with the cup of thy sister Samaria.</span></indent>
    <verse>34</verse><span>Thou shalt even drink it and suck it out,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and thou shalt break the shreds thereof,</span></indent>

    committed adultery, and have also caused their sons, whom they bare unto

    Aholibah, the lewd women.
    </span><verse>45</verse><span>And the righteous
    men, they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the

   <block>
    <verse>2</verse><span>Son of man, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude:</span><break></break><span>
    Whom art thou like in thy greatness?</span><break></break>
    <verse>3</verse><span>Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>with fair branches, and with a shadowing shroud,</span></indent><span>
    and of a high stature;</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and his top was among the thick boughs.</span></indent>
    <verse>4</verse><span>The waters made him great,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>the deep set him up on high</span></indent><span>
    with her rivers running round about his plants,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and sent out her little rivers unto all the trees of the field.</span></indent>
    <verse>5</verse><span>Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and his boughs were multiplied,</span></indent><span>
    and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>when he shot forth.</span></indent>
    <verse>6</verse><span>All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young,</span></indent>
    <indent><span>and under his shadow dwelt all great nations.</span></indent>
    <verse>7</verse><span>Thus was he fair in his greatness,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>in the length of his branches;</span></indent>
    <indent><span>for his root was by great waters.</span></indent>
    <verse>8</verse><span>The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him;</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>the fir trees were not like his boughs,</span></indent><span>
    and the chestnut trees were not like his branches;</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>not any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his beauty.</span></indent>
    <verse>9</verse><span>I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches;</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>so that all the trees of Eden,</span></indent>
    <indent><span>that were in the garden of God, envied him.</span></indent>
   </block>

   <block>
    <verse>10</verse><span>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD: Because thou hast lifted up thyself
    in height, and he hath shot up his top among the thick boughs, and his
    heart is lifted up in his height;
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the
    heathen; he shall surely deal with him; I have driven him out for his
    wickedness.
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and have
    left him; upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are
    fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land; and all
    the people of the earth are gone down from his shadow, and have left
    him.
    </span><verse>13</verse><span>Upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain, and all the
    beasts of the field shall be upon his branches;
    </span><verse>14</verse><span>to the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves
    for their height, neither shoot up their top among the thick boughs,
    neither their trees stand up in their height, all that drink water; for
    they are all delivered unto death, to the nether parts of the earth, in
    the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to the
    pit.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>15</verse><span>Thus saith the Lord GOD: In the day when he went down to the grave I
    caused a mourning; I covered the deep for him, and I restrained the
    floods thereof, and the great waters were stayed; and I caused Lebanon
    to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.
    </span><verse>16</verse><span>I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him
    down to hell with them that descend into the pit; and all the trees of
    Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, shall be
    comforted in the nether parts of the earth.
    </span><verse>17</verse><span>They also went down into hell with him, unto them that be slain with
    the sword; and they that were his arm, that dwelt under his shadow in

    <verse>18</verse><span>To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of

  The duty of a watchman

 <chapter>33

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:
  </span><quote>
   <block>
    <verse>2</verse><span>Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them,
    ‘When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a
    man of their coasts, and set him for their watchman;
    </span><verse>3</verse><span>if when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the
    trumpet, and warn the people;
    </span><verse>4</verse><span>then whosoever
    heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning; if the sword
    come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head.
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not
    warning; his blood shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning shall
    deliver his soul.
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>But if the watchman see the
    sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned; if the
    sword come, and take any person from among them, he is taken away in his
    iniquity; but his blood will I require at the watchman’s hand.’
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>7</verse><span>So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of
    Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them
    from me.
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>When I say unto the wicked, ‘O wicked man, thou shalt surely die;’ if
    thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man
    shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.
    </span><verse>9</verse><span>Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he
    do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast
    delivered thy soul.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>10</verse><span>Therefore, O thou son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, “Thus ye
    speak, saying, ‘If our transgressions and our sins be upon us, and we
    pine away in them, how should we then live?’”
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>Say unto them, “’As I live,’ saith the Lord GOD, ‘I have no pleasure in
    the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live;
    turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of
    Israel?’”</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>12</verse><span>Therefore, thou son of man, say unto the children of thy people, “The
    righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his
    transgression; as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall
    thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness; neither shall
    the righteous be able to live for his righteousness in the day that he
    sinneth.
    </span><verse>13</verse><span>When I shall say to the righteous, that he shall surely live; if he
    trust to his own righteousness, and commit iniquity, all his
    righteousness shall not be remembered; but for his iniquity that he hath
    committed, he shall die for it.
    </span><verse>14</verse><span>Again, when I say unto the wicked, ‘Thou shalt surely die;’ if he turn
    from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right;
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>if the wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had robbed, walk
    in the statutes of life, without committing iniquity; he shall surely
    live, he shall not die.
    </span><verse>16</verse><span>None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him; he
    hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live.”</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>17</verse><span>Yet the children of thy people say, ‘The way of the LORD is not equal.’
    But as for them, their way is not equal.
    </span><verse>18</verse><span>When the righteous turneth from his righteousness, and committeth
    iniquity, he shall even die thereby.
    </span><verse>19</verse><span>But if the wicked turn from his wickedness, and do that which is lawful
    and right, he shall live thereby.
    </span><verse>20</verse><span>Yet ye say, ‘The way of the LORD is not equal.’ O ye house of Israel, I
    will judge you everyone after his ways.</span></block>

  <verse>1</verse><span>And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:
  </span><quote>
   <block>
    <verse>2</verse><span>Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy and say
    unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD unto the shepherds:</span></block>

   <block><span>
    Woe be to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! Should not the
    shepherds feed the flocks?
    </span><verse>3</verse><span>Ye eat the fat, and
    ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill them that are fed; but ye feed not
    the flock.
    </span><verse>4</verse><span>The diseased have ye not
    strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye
    bound up that which was broken, neither have ye brought again that which
    was driven away, neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with
    force and with cruelty have ye ruled them.
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>And
    they were scattered, because there is no shepherd; and they became meat to
    all the beasts of the field, when they were scattered.
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and
    upon every high hill; yea, my flock was scattered upon all the face of the
    earth, and none did search or seek after them.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>7</verse><span>Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD.
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely because my flock became a prey,
    and my flock became meat to every beast of the field, because there was
    no shepherd, neither did my shepherds search for my flock, but the
    shepherds fed themselves, and fed not my flock;
    </span><verse>9</verse><span>therefore, O ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD.
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>Thus saith the Lord GOD: Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I will
    require my flock at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the
    flock; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves anymore, for I will
    deliver my flock from their mouth, that they may not be meat for
    them.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>11</verse><span>For thus saith the Lord GOD: Behold, I, even I, will both search my
    sheep, and seek them out.
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his
    sheep that are scattered; so will I seek out my sheep, and will deliver
    them out of all places where thy have been scattered in the cloudy and
    dark day.
    </span><verse>13</verse><span>And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them from the
    countries, and will bring them to their
    own land, and feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers, and in
    all the inhabited places of the country.
    </span><verse>14</verse><span>I will
    feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains of Israel shall
    their fold be; there shall they lie in a good fold, and in a fat pasture
    shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel.
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>I
    will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord GOD.
    </span><verse>16</verse><span>I will seek that which was lost, and bring
    again that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken,
    and will strengthen that which was sick; but I will destroy the fat and
    the strong; I will feed them with judgment.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>17</verse><span>And as for you, O my flock, thus saith the Lord GOD: Behold, I judge
    between cattle and cattle, between the rams and the he goats.
    </span><verse>18</verse><span>Seemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good pasture,
    but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures? And
    to have drunk of the deep waters, but ye must foul the residue with your
    feet?
    </span><verse>19</verse><span>And as for my flock, they eat that which ye have trodden with your
    feet; and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>20</verse><span>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD unto them: Behold, I, even I, will
    judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle.
    </span><verse>21</verse><span>Because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder, and pushed all the
    diseased with your horns, till ye have scattered them abroad;
    </span><verse>22</verse><span>therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey; and I
    will judge between cattle and cattle.
    </span><verse>23</verse><span>And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even
    my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.

    them; I the LORD have spoken it.</span></block>

    beasts to cease out of the land; and they shall dwell safely in the

    </span><verse>26</verse><span>And I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing; and
    I will cause the shower to come down in his season; there shall be
    showers of blessing.
    </span><verse>27</verse><span>And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth shall
    yield her increase, and they shall be safe in their land, and shall know
    that I am the LORD, when I have broken the bands of their yoke, and
    delivered them out of the hand of those that served themselves of them.
    </span><verse>28</verse><span>And they shall no more be a prey to the heathen, neither shall the
    beasts of the land devour them; but they shall dwell safely, and none
    shall make them afraid.
    </span><verse>29</verse><span>And I will raise up for them a plant of renown, and they shall be no
    more consumed with hunger in the land, neither bear the shame of the

  <verse>1</verse><span>Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:
  </span><quote>
   <block>
    <verse>2</verse><span>Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it,
    </span><verse>3</verse><span>and say unto it, Thus saith the Lord GOD: Behold, O mount Seir, I am
    against thee, and I will stretch out mine hand against thee, and I will
    make thee most desolate.
    </span><verse>4</verse><span>I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate, and thou shalt
    know that I am the LORD.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>5</verse><span>Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred, and hast shed the blood of
    the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their
    calamity, in the time that their iniquity had an end;
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>therefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will prepare thee unto
    blood, and blood shall pursue thee; since thou hast not hated blood,
    even blood shall pursue thee.
    </span><verse>7</verse><span>Thus will I make mount Seir most desolate, and cut off from it him that
    passeth out and him that returneth.
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>And I will fill his mountains with his slain men;
    in thy hills, and in thy valleys, and in all thy rivers, shall they fall
    that are slain with the sword.
    </span><verse>9</verse><span>I will make thee
    perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall not return; and ye shall know
    that I am the LORD.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>10</verse><span>Because thou hast said, ‘These two nations and these two countries
    shall be mine, and we will possess it;’ whereas the LORD was there;
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>therefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will even do according to
    thine anger, and according to thine envy, which thou hast used out of
    thy hatred against them; and I will make myself known among them, when I
    have judged thee.
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>And thou shalt know that I am the LORD, and that I have heard all thy
    blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel,
    saying, ‘They are laid desolate, they are given us to consume.’
    </span><verse>13</verse><span>Thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me, and have multiplied
    your words against me; I have heard them.
    </span><verse>14</verse><span>Thus saith the Lord GOD: When the whole earth rejoiceth, I will make
    thee desolate.
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel,
    because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee; thou shalt be desolate,

    forsaken, which became a prey and derision to the residue of the heathen
    that are round about;
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>therefore thus saith the Lord GOD: Surely in the fire of my jealousy
    have I spoken against the residue of the heathen, and against all

    <verse>17</verse><span>Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they

    </span><verse>18</verse><span>Wherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed
    upon the land, and for their idols wherewith they had polluted it;

 <heading><span>The valley of dry bones

 <chapter>37
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>The hand of the LORD was upon me, and carried me out in the Spirit of
  the LORD, and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of
  bones,
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>and caused me to pass by them round about; and, behold, there were very
  many in the open valley; and, lo, they were very dry.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>And he said unto me, “Son of man, can these bones live?” And I
  answered, “O Lord GOD, thou knowest.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Again he said unto me, “Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto them,
  ‘O ye dry bones, hear the word of the LORD.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>Thus saith the Lord GOD unto these bones: Behold, I will cause breath
  to enter into you, and ye shall live;
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>and I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and
  cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye
  shall know that I am the LORD.’”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>So I prophesied as I was commanded; and as I prophesied, there was a
  noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his
  bone.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and
  the skin covered them above, but there was no breath in them.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>Then said he unto me, “Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man,
  and say to the wind, ‘Thus saith the Lord GOD: Come from the four winds,
  O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.’”
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and
  they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>Then he said unto me, “Son of man, these bones are the whole house of
  Israel; behold, they say, ‘Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost; we
  are cut off for our parts.’
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>Therefore prophesy and say unto them, ‘Thus saith the Lord GOD: Behold,
  O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of
  your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I have opened your graves, O
  my people, and brought you up out of your graves.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>And shall put my Spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I shall place
  you in your own land; then shall ye know that I the LORD have spoken it,

    burn them with fire seven years;
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>so that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut down any
    out of the forests; for
    they shall burn the weapons with fire; and they shall spoil those that
    spoiled them, and rob those that robbed them, saith the Lord GOD.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>11</verse><span>And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give unto Gog a
    place there of graves in Israel, the valley of the passengers on the
    east of the sea; and it shall stop the noses of the passengers; and
    there shall they bury Gog and all his multitude; and they shall call it,
    The valley of Hamon-Gog.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>12</verse><span>And seven months shall the house of Israel be burying of them, that
    they may cleanse the land.
    </span><verse>13</verse><span>Yea, all the people of the land shall bury them; and it shall be to
    them a renown the day that I shall be glorified, saith the Lord GOD.
    </span><verse>14</verse><span>And they shall sever out men of continual employment, passing through
    the land, to bury with the passengers those that remain upon the face of
    the earth, to cleanse it.</span></block>

   <block><span>After the end of seven months shall they search,
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>and the passengers that pass through the land,
    when any seeth a man’s bone, then shall he set up a sign by it, till the
    buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamon-Gog.
    </span><verse>16</verse><span>And also the name of the city shall be Hamonah.
    Thus shall they cleanse the land.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>17</verse><span>And, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD, speak unto every

    sacrifice for you, even a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel,
    that ye may eat flesh and drink blood.
    </span><verse>18</verse><span>Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty and drink the blood of the princes
    of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bullocks, all of them
    fatlings of Bashan.
    </span><verse>19</verse><span>And ye shall eat fat till ye be full, and drink blood till ye be
    drunken, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you.
    </span><verse>20</verse><span>Thus ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots, with
    mighty men, and with all men of war, saith the Lord GOD.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>21</verse><span>And I will set my glory among the heathen, and all the heathen shall
    see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid upon

    </span><verse>22</verse><span>So the house of Israel shall know that I am the LORD their God from
    that day and forward.
    </span><verse>23</verse><span>And the heathen shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity
    for their iniquity; because they trespassed against me, therefore hid I
    my face from them, and gave them into the hand of their enemies; so fell
    they all by the sword.
    </span><verse>24</verse><span>According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions

   <block>
    <verse>25</verse><span>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD: Now will I bring again the captivity

    jealous for my holy name;
    </span><verse>26</verse><span>After that they have borne their shame, and all their trespasses
    whereby they have trespassed against me, when they dwelt safely in their
    land, and none made them afraid.
    </span><verse>27</verse><span>When I have brought them again from the people, and gathered them out
    of their enemies’ lands, and am sanctified in them in the sight of many
    nations;
    </span><verse>28</verse><span>then shall they know that I am the LORD their God, which caused them to
    be led into captivity among the heathen; but I have gathered them unto
    their own land, and have left none of them anymore there.
    </span><verse>29</verse><span>Neither will I hide my face anymore from them; for I have poured out my
    Spirit upon the house of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.</span></block>

 <chapter>40

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of
  the year, in the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after
  that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day the hand of the LORD was
  upon me, and brought me thither.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me
  upon a very high mountain, by which was as the frame of a city on the
  south.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And he brought me thither, and, behold, there was a man whose
  appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his
  hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear
  with thine ears, and set thine heart upon all that I shall show thee;
  for to the intent that I might show them unto thee are thou brought
  hither; declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the
  man’s hand a measuring reed of six cubits long by the cubit and a
  handbreadth; so he measured the breadth of the building, one reed; and
  the height, one reed.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and went up
  the stairs thereof, and measured the threshold of the gate, which was
  one reed broad; and the other
  threshold of the gate, which was one reed broad.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And every little chamber was one reed long, and
  one reed broad; and between the little chambers were five cubits; and the
  threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within was one reed.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>He measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts
  thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was inward.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>And the little chambers of the gate eastward were three on this side,
  and three on that side; they three were of one measure; and the posts
  had one measure on this side and on that side.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten cubits; and
  the length of the gate, thirteen cubits.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>The space also before the little chambers was one cubit on this side,
  and the space was one cubit on that side; and the little chambers were
  six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>He measured then the gate from the roof of one little chamber to the
  roof of another; the breadth was five and twenty cubits, door against
  door.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>He made also posts of threescore cubits, even unto the post of the
  court round about the gate.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of the
  porch of the inner gate were fifty cubits.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And there were narrow windows to the little chambers, and to their
  posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches; and
  windows were round about inward; and upon each post were palm
  trees.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>Then brought he me into the outward court, and, lo, there were chambers
  and a pavement made for the court round about; thirty chambers were upon
  the pavement.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>And the pavement by the side of the gates over against the length of
  the gates was the lower pavement.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto
  the forefront of the inner court without, a hundred cubits eastward and
  northward.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>And the gate of the outward court that looked toward the north, he
  measured the length thereof, and the breadth thereof.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>And the little chambers thereof were three on this side and three on
  that side; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after the
  measure of the first gate; the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the
  breadth five and twenty cubits.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>And their windows, and their arches, and their palm trees, were after
  the measure of the gate that looketh toward the east; and they went up
  unto it by seven steps; and the arches thereof were before them.
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>And the gate of the inner court was over against the gate toward the
  north, and toward the east; and he measured from gate to gate a hundred
  cubits.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>After that he brought me toward the south, and behold a gate toward the
  south; and he measured the posts thereof, and the arches thereof,
  according to these measures.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>And there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about,
  like those windows; the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five
  and twenty cubits.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>And there were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches thereof were
  before them; and it had palm trees, one on this side, and another on
  that side, upon the posts thereof.
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>And there was a gate in the inner court toward the south; and he
  measured from gate to gate toward the south a hundred cubits.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>28</verse><span>And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate; and he measured
  the south gate according to these measures;
  </span><verse>29</verse><span>and the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches
  thereof, according to these measures; and there were windows in it and
  in the arches thereof round about; it was fifty cubits long, and five
  and twenty cubits broad.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>30</verse><span>And the arches round about were five and twenty cubits long, and five
  cubits broad.
  </span><verse>31</verse><span>And the arches thereof were toward the outer court; and palm trees were
  upon the posts thereof; and the going up to it had eight steps.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>32</verse><span>And he brought me into the inner court toward the east; and he measured
  the gate according to these measures.
  </span><verse>33</verse><span>And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches
  thereof, were according to these measures; and there were windows
  therein and in the arches thereof round about; it was fifty cubits long,
  and five and twenty cubits broad.
  </span><verse>34</verse><span>And the arches thereof were toward the outward court; and palm trees
  were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side; and the
  going up to it had eight steps.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>35</verse><span>And he brought me to the north gate, and measured it according to these
  measures;
  </span><verse>36</verse><span>the
  little chambers thereof, the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, and
  the windows to it round about; the length was fifty cubits, and the
  breadth five and twenty cubits.
  </span><verse>37</verse><span>And the posts
  thereof were toward the outer court; and palm trees were upon the posts
  thereof, on this side, and on that side; and the going up to it had eight
  steps.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>38</verse><span>And the chambers and the entries thereof were by the posts of the
  gates, where they washed the burnt offering.
  </span><verse>39</verse><span>And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two
  tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt offering and the sin
  offering and trespass offering.
  </span><verse>40</verse><span>And at the side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the north
  gate, were two tables; and on the other side, which was at the porch of
  the gate, were two tables.
  </span><verse>41</verse><span>Four tables were on this side and four tables on that side, by the side
  of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew their sacrifices.
  </span><verse>42</verse><span>And the four tables were of hewn stone for the burnt offering, of a
  cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half broad, and one cubit high;
  whereupon also they laid the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt
  offering and the sacrifice.
  </span><verse>43</verse><span>And within were hooks, a hand broad, fastened round about; and upon the
  tables was the flesh of the offering.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>44</verse><span>And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the
  inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their prospect
  was toward the south; one at the side of the east gate having the
  prospect toward the north.
  </span><verse>45</verse><span>And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the south,
  is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house.
  </span><verse>46</verse><span>And the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests,
  the keepers of the charge of the altar; these are the sons of Zadok
  among the sons of Levi, which come near to the LORD to minister unto
  him.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>47</verse><span>So he measured the court, a hundred cubits long, and a hundred cubits
  broad, foursquare; and the altar that was before the house.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>48</verse><span>And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of
  the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side; and
  the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three cubits
  on that side.
  </span><verse>49</verse><span>The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven
  cubits; and he brought me by the steps whereby they went up to it; and
  there were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that
  side.
 </span></block>

 <chapter>41
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Afterward he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six
  cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side,
  which was the breadth of the tabernacle.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And the breadth of the door was ten cubits; and the sides of the door
  were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side; and
  he measured the length thereof, forty cubits, and the breadth, twenty
  cubits.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>Then went he inward, and measured the post of the door, two cubits; and
  the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door, seven cubits.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>So he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits; and the breadth,
  twenty cubits, before the temple; and he said unto me, ‘This is the most
  holy place.’
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>After he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of
  every side chamber, four cubits, round about the house on every side.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And the side chambers were
  three, one over another, and thirty in order; and they entered into the
  wall which was of the house for the side chambers round about, that they
  might have hold, but they had not hold in the wall of the house.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And there was an enlarging, and a winding about
  still upward to the side chambers; for the winding about of the house went
  still upward round about the house; therefore the breadth of the house was
  still upward, and so increased from the lowest chamber to the highest by
  the midst.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>I saw also the height of the house round about; the foundations of the
  side chambers were a full reed of six great cubits.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>The thickness of the wall, which was for the side chamber without, was
  five cubits; and that which was left was the place of the side chambers
  that were within.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And between the chambers was the wideness of twenty cubits round about
  the house on every side.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And the doors of the side chambers were toward the place that was left,
  one door toward the north, and another door toward the south; and the
  breadth of the place that was left was five cubits round about.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>Now the building that was before the separate place at the end toward
  the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five
  cubits thick round about, and the length thereof ninety cubits.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>So he measured the house, a hundred cubits long; and the separate
  place, and the building, with the walls thereof, a hundred cubits long;
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place
  toward the east, a hundred cubits.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And he measured the length of the building over against the separate
  place which was behind it, and the galleries thereof on the one side and
  on the other side, a hundred cubits, with the inner temple, and the
  porches of the court;
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>the doorposts, and the narrow windows, and the galleries round about on
  their three stories, over against the door, ceiled with wood round
  about, and from the ground up to the windows, and the windows were
  covered;
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>to that above the door, even unto the inner house, and without, and by
  all the wall round about within and without, by measure.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>And it was made with cherubim and palm trees, so that a palm tree was
  between a cherub and a cherub; and every cherub had two faces;
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>so that the face of a man was toward the palm tree on the one side, and
  the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side; it was
  made through all the house round about.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>From the ground unto above the door were cherubim and palm trees made,
  and on the wall of the temple.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>The posts of the temple were squared, and the face of the sanctuary;
  the appearance of the one as the appearance of the other.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>The altar of wood was three cubits high, and the length thereof two
  cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the walls
  thereof, were of wood; and he said unto me, ‘This is the table that is
  before the LORD.’
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>And the doors had two leaves apiece, two turning leaves; two leaves for
  the one door, and two leaves for the other door.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubim and
  palm trees, like as were made upon the walls; and there were thick
  planks upon the face of the porch without.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>And there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and on the
  other side, on the sides of the porch, and upon the side chambers of the
  house, and thick planks.
 </span></block>

 <chapter>42
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Then he brought me forth into the outer court, the way toward the
  north; and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the
  separate place, and which was before the building toward the north.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>Before the length of a hundred cubits was the north door, and the
  breadth was fifty cubits.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>Over against the twenty cubits which were for the inner court, and over
  against the pavement which was for the outer court, was gallery against
  gallery in three stories.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And before the chambers was a walk of ten cubits breadth
  inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors toward the north.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>Now the upper chambers were shorter; for the
  galleries were higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost
  of the building.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>For they were in three stories,
  but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts; therefore the building
  was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And the wall that was without over against the
  chambers, toward the outer court on the forepart of the chambers, the
  length thereof was fifty cubits.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>For the length
  of the chambers that were in the outer court was fifty cubits; and, lo,
  before the temple were a hundred cubits.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>And
  from under these chambers was the entry on the east side, as one goeth
  into them from the outer court.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>The chambers were in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the
  east, over against the separate place, and over against the building.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And the way before them was like the appearance of the chambers which
  were toward the north, as long as they, and as broad as they; and all
  their goings out were both according to their fashions, and according to
  their doors.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south
  was a door in the head of the way, even the way directly before the wall
  toward the east, as one entereth into them.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>Then said he unto me:</span><quote><span>
   The north chambers and the south chambers, which are before the separate
   place, they be holy chambers, where the priests that approach unto the
   LORD shall eat the most holy things; there shall they lay the most holy
   things, and the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass
   offering; for the place is holy.
   </span><verse>14</verse><span>When the
   priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of the holy place into
   the outer court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they
   minister; for they are holy; and shall put on other garments, and shall
   approach to those things which are for the people.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me
  forth toward the gate whose prospect is toward the east, and measured it
  round about.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds,
  with the measuring reed round about.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed
  round about.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring
  reed.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds, with
  the measuring reed.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>He measured it by the four sides; it had a wall round about, five
  hundred reeds long, and five hundred broad, to make a separation between
  the sanctuary and the profane place.

  <verse>1</verse><span>Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looketh toward
  the east;
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>and,
  behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east; and
  his voice was like a noise of many waters; and the earth shined with his
  glory.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And it was according to the appearance of
  the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I
  came to destroy the city; and the visions were like the vision that I saw

  Daniel’s arrival in Babylon
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>1
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came
  Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And the LORD gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of
  the vessels of the house of God; which he carried into the land of
  Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the
  treasure house of his god.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he
  should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of the king’s seed,
  and of the princes;
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>children in whom was no blemish, but well favored, and skillful in all
  wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as
  had ability in them to stand in the king’s palace, and whom they might
  teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king’s meat, and
  of the wine which he drank; so nourishing them three years, that at the
  end thereof they might stand before the king.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah,
  Mishael, and Azariah;
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names; for he gave unto Daniel
  the name of Beltheshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael,
  of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with
  the portion of the king’s meat, nor with the wine which he drank;
  therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not
  defile himself.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>Now God had brought Daniel into favor and tender love with the prince
  of the eunuchs.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, “I fear my lord the
  king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink; for why should he see
  your faces worse liking than the children which are of your sort? Then
  shall ye make me endanger my head to the king.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over
  Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>“Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us
  pulse to eat, and water to drink.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the
  countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king’s meat;
  and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.”
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and
  fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the
  king’s meat.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they
  should drink; and gave them pulse.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all
  learning and wisdom; and Daniel had understanding in all visions and
  dreams.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them
  in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before
  Nebuchadnezzar.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like
  Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; therefore stood they before the
  king.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king inquired
  of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and
  astrologers that were in all his realm.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus.

 <heading><span>Nebuchadnezzar’s dream
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>2
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar
  dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake
  from him.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and
  the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to show the king his dreams. So
  they came and stood before the king.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And the king said unto them, “I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was
  troubled to know the dream.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriac, “O king, live forever;
  tell thy servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, “The thing is gone from
  me; if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation
  thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a
  dunghill.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>But if ye show the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall
  receive of me gifts and rewards and great honor; therefore show me the
  dream, and the interpretation thereof.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>They answered again and said, “Let the king tell his servants the
  dream, and we will show the interpretation of it.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>The king answered and said, “I know of certainty that ye would gain the
  time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but one
  decree for you; for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak
  before me, till the time be changed; therefore tell me the dream, and I
  shall know that ye can show me the interpretation thereof.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, “There is not a man
  upon the earth that can show the king’s matter; therefore there is no
  king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or
  astrologer, or Chaldean.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other
  that can show it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not
  with flesh.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to
  destroy all the wise men of Babylon.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they
  sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of
  the king’s guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon;
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>he answered and said to Arioch the king’s captain, “Why is the decree
  so hasty from the king?” Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him
  time, and that he would show the king the interpretation.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah,
  Mishael, and Azariah, his companions;
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>that they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this
  secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of
  the wise men of Babylon.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel
  blessed the God of heaven.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>Daniel answered and said:

  <verse>24</verse><span>Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to

  “Destroy not the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I
  will show unto the king the interpretation.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>25</verse><span>Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus
  unto him, “I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make

 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>26</verse><span>The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, “Art

    The secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men, the
    astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, show unto the king;
    </span><verse>28</verse><span>but there is a God in heaven that revealeth
    secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the

   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>29</verse><span>As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed, what
    should come to pass hereafter; and he that revealeth secrets maketh
    known to thee what shall come to pass.
    </span><verse>30</verse><span>But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I
    have more than any living, but for their sakes that shall make known the
    interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of
    thy heart.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>31</verse><span>Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose
    brightness was excellent, stood before thee, and the form thereof was
    terrible.
    </span><verse>32</verse><span>This image’s head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver,
    his belly and his thighs of brass,
    </span><verse>33</verse><span>his legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.
    </span><verse>34</verse><span>Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote
    the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them to
    pieces.
    </span><verse>35</verse><span>Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold,
    broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer
    threshing floors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was
    found for them; and the stone that smote the image became a great
    mountain, and filled the whole earth.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>36</verse><span>This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before
    the king.
    </span><verse>37</verse><span>Thou,

    breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things; and as iron that breaketh
    all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.
    </span><verse>41</verse><span>And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters’ clay, and
    part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of
    the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with
    miry clay.
    </span><verse>42</verse><span>And as the toes of the feet were part of iron,
    and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.

    </span><verse>10</verse><span>Thou, O king, hast made a
    decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute,
    harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, shall fall
    down and worship the golden image;
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>and whoso
    falleth not down and worshipeth, that he should be cast into the midst of
    a burning fiery furnace.
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the
    province of
    Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; these men, O king, have not
    regarded thee; they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which
    thou hast set up.

   Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, do not ye serve my gods,

  <verse>16</verse><span>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered and said to the king:</span><quote><span>
   O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter.

  <verse>19</verse><span>Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was
  changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; therefore he spake, and
  commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it
  was wont to be heated.
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind
  Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery
  furnace.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their hats,

  fiery furnace.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>Therefore because the king’s commandment was urgent, and the furnace
  exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up
  Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound
  into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in haste, and

  They answered and said unto the king, “True, O king.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>25</verse><span>He answered and said, “Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst

 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, came forth of the midst of the
  fire.
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>And the princes, governors, and captains,

  neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on
  them.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>28</verse><span>Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said:</span><quote><span>
   Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his
   angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed
   the king’s word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor
   worship any god, except their own God.
   </span><verse>29</verse><span>Therefore I make a decree, That every people,
   nation, and language, which speak anything amiss against the God of
   Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses

  <verse>4</verse><span>I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house, and flourishing in my

  </span><verse>5</verse><span>I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my bed and

  </span><verse>6</verse><span>Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon

  </span><verse>7</verse><span>Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the

  </span><verse>8</verse><span>But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar,

  </span><quote>
   <block>
    <verse>9</verse><span>O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit
    of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell me the

    </span><verse>10</verse><span>Thus were the visions of mine head in my bed; I saw, and behold a tree
    in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was great.
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto
    heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth;
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>the leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was
    meat for all; the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls
    of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof, and all flesh was fed of
    it.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>13</verse><span>I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and
    a holy one came down from heaven;
    </span><verse>14</verse><span>he cried aloud, and said thus, “Hew down the tree, and cut off his
    branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit; let the beasts
    get away from under it, and the fowls from his branches;
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>nevertheless, leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even with a
    band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be
    wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts in
    the grass of the earth;
    </span><verse>16</verse><span>let his heart be changed from man’s, and let a beast’s heart be given
    unto him; and let seven times pass over him.
    </span><verse>17</verse><span>This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by thy
    word of the holy ones; to the intent that the living may know that the
    Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he
    will, and setteth up over it the basest of men.”</span></block>

    My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation

    of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till
    seven times pass over him;”
    </span><verse>24</verse><span>this is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the Most

  </span><verse>2</verse><span>Belshazzar, while he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and

  therein.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>Then they brought the golden vessels

  </span><verse>3</verse><span>Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes,

  Dream of four beasts
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>7
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream and
  visions of his head upon his bed; then he wrote the dream, and told the
  sum of the matters.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>Daniel spake and said:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>
    I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven
    strove upon the great sea.
    </span><verse>3</verse><span>And four great beasts
    came up from the sea, diverse one from another.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>4</verse><span>The first was like a lion, and had eagle’s wings; I beheld till the
    wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and
    made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man’s heart was given to
    it.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>5</verse><span>And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up
    itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the
    teeth of it; and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>6</verse><span>After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the
    back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and
    dominion was given to it.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>7</verse><span>After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast,
    dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron
    teeth; it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the
    feet of it; and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it;
    and it had ten horns.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>8</verse><span>I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another
    little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up
    by the roots; and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man,
    and a mouth speaking great things.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>9</verse><span>I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did
    sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the
    pure wool; his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as
    burning fire.
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him; thousand
    thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood
    before him; the judgment was set, and the books were opened.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>11</verse><span>I beheld then, because of the voice of the great words which the horn
    spake; I beheld even till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed,
    and given to the burning flame.
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken
    away; yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>13</verse><span>I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came
    with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they
    brought him near before him.
    </span><verse>14</verse><span>And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all
    people, nations, and languages, should serve him; his dominion is an
    everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that
    which shall not be destroyed.</span></block>

  Interpretation of the dream
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>I, Daniel, was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body, and the
  visions of my head troubled me.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of
  all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the
  things.</span><quote>
   <verse>17</verse><span>These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise
   out of the earth.
   </span><verse>18</verse><span>But the saints of the Most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the
   kingdom forever, even forever and ever.</span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from
  all the other, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and his
  nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue
  with his feet;
  </span><verse>20</verse><span>And of the ten horns that were in his head, and of the other which came
  up, and before whom three fell; even of that horn that had eyes, and a
  mouth that spake very great things, whose look was more stout than his
  fellows.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed
  against them;
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of
  the Most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the
  kingdom.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>23</verse><span>Thus he said:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>
    The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be
    diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall
    tread it down, and break it in pieces.
    </span><verse>24</verse><span>And the
    ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise; and another
    shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he
    shall subdue three kings.
    </span><verse>25</verse><span>And he shall speak
    great words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the
    Most High, and think to change times and laws; and they shall be given
    into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>26</verse><span>But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to
    consume and to destroy it unto the end.
    </span><verse>27</verse><span>And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under
    the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most
    High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall
    serve and obey him.</span></block>

  </quote>
 </block>

 <block>

  much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me; but I kept the

  Vision of a ram and a goat
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>8
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared
  unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the
  first.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at
  Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in a
  vision, and I was by the river Ulai.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before
  the river a ram which had two horns; and the two horns were high; but
  one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that
  no beasts might stand before him neither was there any that could
  deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became
  great.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>And as I was considering, behold, a he goat came from the west on the
  face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground; and the goat had a
  notable horn between his eyes.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen standing
  before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler
  against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns; and there was
  no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the
  ground, and stamped upon him; and there was none that could deliver the
  ram out of his hand.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>Therefore the he goat waxed very great; and when he was strong, the
  great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the
  four winds of heaven.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding
  great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant
  land.
  </span><verse>10</verse><span>And it waxed great, even to
  the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to
  the ground, and stamped upon them.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>Yea, he
  magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily
  sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>And a host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of
  transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it
  practiced, and prospered.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that
  certain saint which spake, “How long shall be the vision concerning the
  daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the
  sanctuary and the host to be trodden underfoot?”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>And he said unto me, “Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then
  shall the sanctuary be cleansed.”
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>Interpretation of the vision
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, and
  sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the
  appearance of a man.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>And I heard a man’s voice between the banks of Ulai, which called, and
  said, “Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>So he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was afraid, and fell
  upon my face; but he said unto me, “Understand, O son of man; for at the
  time of the end shall be the vision.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward
  the ground; but he touched me, and set me upright.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>And he said:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>
    Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the
    indignation; for at the time appointed the end shall be.
    </span><verse>20</verse><span>The ram which thou sawest having two horns are
    the kings of Media and Persia.
    </span><verse>21</verse><span>And the rough
    goat is the king of Grecia; and the great horn that is between his eyes is
    the first king.
    </span><verse>22</verse><span>Now that being broken, whereas
    four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but
    not in his power.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>23</verse><span>And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are
    come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark
    sentences, shall stand up.
    </span><verse>24</verse><span>And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power; and he shall
    destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practice, and shall destroy
    the mighty and the holy people.
    </span><verse>25</verse><span>And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his
    hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by peace shall
    destroy many; he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but
    he shall be broken without hand.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>26</verse><span>And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is true;
    wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it shall be for many days.</span></block>

    O Lord, the great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant and mercy to them

    </span><verse>5</verse><span>we have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and
    have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts
    and from thy judgments;
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>neither have we
    hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, which spake in thy name to our

    through all the countries whither thou hast driven them, because of
    their trespass that they have trespassed against thee.
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our

    have sinned against him.
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us, and against

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks.

  Kings of the south and north
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>And the king of the south shall be strong, and one of his princes; and
  he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion shall be a
  great dominion.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for the
  king’s daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make
  an agreement; but she shall not retain the power of the arm; neither
  shall he stand, nor his arm; but she shall be given up, and they that
  brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in
  these times.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his estate which
  shall come with an army, and shall enter into the fortress of the king
  of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail;
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>and shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with their
  princes, and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold; and he
  shall continue more years than the king of the north.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>So the king of the south shall come into his kingdom, and shall return
  into his own land.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of
  great forces; and one shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass
  through; then shall he return, and be stirred up, even to his fortress.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And the king of the south shall be moved with choler, and shall come
  forth and fight with him, even with the king of the north; and he shall
  set forth a great multitude; but the multitude shall be given into his
  hand.
  </span><verse>12</verse><span>And when he hath taken away the multitude, his heart shall be lifted
  up; and he shall cast down many ten thousands; but he shall not be
  strengthened by it.
  </span><verse>13</verse><span>For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude
  greater than the former, and shall certainly come after certain years
  with a great army and with much riches.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the
  south; also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to
  establish the vision; but they shall fall.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mount, and take the
  most fenced cities; and the arms of the south shall not withstand,
  neither his chosen people, neither shall there be any strength to
  withstand.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will, and
  none shall stand before him; and he shall stand in the glorious land,
  which by his hand shall be consumed.
  </span><verse>17</verse><span>He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole
  kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do; and he shall give
  him the daughter of women, corrupting her; but she shall not stand on
  his side, neither be for him.
  </span><verse>18</verse><span>After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall take many;
  but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him
  to cease; without his own reproach he shall cause it to turn upon him.
  </span><verse>19</verse><span>Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land; but he
  shall stumble and fall, and not be found.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory of the
  kingdom; but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger,
  nor in battle.
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they shall not
  give the honor of the kingdom; but he shall come in peaceably, and
  obtain the kingdom by flatteries.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before him,
  and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant.
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully; for he
  shall come up, and shall become strong with a small people.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the province;
  and he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers’
  fathers; he shall scatter among them the prey, and spoil, and riches;
  yea, and he shall forecast his devices against the strongholds, even for
  a time.
  </span><verse>25</verse><span>And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the
  south with a great army; and the king of the south shall be stirred up
  to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand; for
  they shall forecast devices against him.
  </span><verse>26</verse><span>Yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy him, and
  his army shall overflow; and many shall fall down slain.
  </span><verse>27</verse><span>And both these kings’ hearts shall be to do mischief, and they shall
  speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper; for yet the end shall
  be at the time appointed.
  </span><verse>28</verse><span>Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his heart
  shall be against the holy covenant; and he shall do exploits, and return
  to his own land.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>29</verse><span>At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the south; but
  it shall not be as the former, or as the latter.

  The western king
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>30</verse><span>For the ships of Chittim shall come against him; therefore he shall be
  grieved, and return, and have indignation against the holy covenant; so
  shall he do; he shall even return, and have intelligence with them that
  forsake the holy covenant.
  </span><verse>31</verse><span>And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary
  of strength, and shall take away the daily sacrifice, and they shall
  place the abomination that maketh desolate.
  </span><verse>32</verse><span>And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall be corrupt by
  flatteries; but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and
  do exploits.
  </span><verse>33</verse><span>And they that understand among the people shall instruct many; yet they
  shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by spoil, many
  days.
  </span><verse>34</verse><span>Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little help; but
  many shall cleave to them with flatteries.
  </span><verse>35</verse><span>And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to
  purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end; because it
  is yet for a time appointed.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>36</verse><span>And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt
  himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvelous
  things against the God of gods, and
  shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished; for that that is
  determined shall be done.
  </span><verse>37</verse><span>Neither shall he regard the God of his
  fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god; for he shall magnify
  himself above all.
  </span><verse>38</verse><span>But in his estate shall he
  honor the God of forces; and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he
  honor with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant
  things.
  </span><verse>39</verse><span>Thus shall he do in the most
  strongholds with a strange god, whom he shall acknowledge and increase
  with glory; and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide
  the land for gain.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>40</verse><span>And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him; and
  the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with
  chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter
  into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over.
  </span><verse>41</verse><span>He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countries shall be
  overthrown; but these shall escape out of his hand, even Edom, and Moab,
  and the chief of the children of Ammon.
  </span><verse>42</verse><span>He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries; and the land
  of Egypt shall not escape.
  </span><verse>43</verse><span>But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and
  over all the precious things of Egypt; and the Libyans and the
  Ethiopians shall be at his steps.
  </span><verse>44</verse><span>But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him;
  therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy, and utterly to
  make away many.
  </span><verse>45</verse><span>And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in
  the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall

  <verse>1</verse><span>And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which
  standeth for the children of thy people; and there shall be a time of

  the river, “How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?”
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the

  sware by him that liveth forever, that it shall be for a time, times,

 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which conceived, and
  bare him a son.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And the LORD said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood
   of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of
   the house of Israel.
   </span><verse>5</verse><span>And it shall come to pass
   at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.

  <verse>1</verse><span>Hear ye this, O priests;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and hearken, ye house of Israel;</span></indent><span>
  and give ye ear, O house of the king;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>for judgment is toward you,</span></indent><span>
  because ye have been a snare on Mizpah,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and a net spread upon Tabor.</span></indent>
  <verse>2</verse><span>And the revolters are profound to make slaughter,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>though I have been a rebuker of them all.</span></indent>
  <verse>3</verse><span>I know Ephraim,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and Israel is not hid from me;</span></indent><span>
  for now, O Ephraim, thou committest whoredom,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and Israel is defiled.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>They will not frame their doings</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>to turn unto their God;</span></indent><span>
  for the spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and they have not known the LORD.</span></indent>
  <verse>5</verse><span>And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity;</span></indent>
  <indent><span>Judah also shall fall with them.</span></indent>
  <verse>6</verse><span>They shall go with their flocks and with their herds</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>to seek the LORD;</span></indent><span>
  but they shall not find him;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he hath withdrawn himself from them.</span></indent>
  <verse>7</verse><span>They have dealt treacherously against the LORD;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>for they have begotten strange children;</span></indent>
  <indent><span>now shall a month devour them with their portions.</span></indent>

  <verse>8</verse><span>Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah,</span><break></break>

  cry aloud at Beth-Aven,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>after thee, O Benjamin.</span></indent>
  <verse>9</verse><span>Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be.</span></indent>
  <verse>10</verse><span>The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>therefore I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.</span></indent>
  <verse>11</verse><span>Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>because he willingly walked after the commandment.</span></indent>
  <verse>12</verse><span>Therefore will I be unto Ephraim as a moth,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and to the house of Judah as rottenness.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>When Ephraim saw his sickness,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and Judah saw his wound,</span></indent><span>
  then went Ephraim to the Assyrian,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and sent to king Jareb;</span></indent><span>
  yet could he not heal you,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>nor cure you of your wound.</span></indent>
  <verse>14</verse><span>For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and as a young lion to the house of Judah;</span></indent><span>
  I, even I, will tear and go away;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>I will take away, and none shall rescue him.</span></indent>
  <verse>15</verse><span>I will go and return to my place,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>till they acknowledge their offense,</span></indent><span>
  and seek my face;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>in their affliction they will seek me early.</span></indent>

  <verse>14</verse><span>Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah:</span><quote><span>
   I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet’s son; but I was a herdman, and

   thus saith the LORD: Thy wife shall be a harlot in the city, and thy sons
   and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided

  <verse>1</verse><span>Now the word of the LORD came unto Jonah, the son of Amittai,
  saying:</span><quote>
   <verse>2</verse><span>Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their
   wickedness is come up before me.</span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD,
  and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish; so he
  paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto
  Tarshish from the presence of the LORD.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>But the LORD sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty
  tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god, and
  cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it
  of them. But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship, and he lay,
  and was fast asleep.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, “What meanest thou, O
  sleeper? Arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us,
  that we perish not.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>And they said everyone to his fellow, “Come, and let us cast lots, that
  we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us.” So they cast lots,
  and the lot fell upon Jonah.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>Then said they unto him, “Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this
  evil is upon us; What is thine occupation? And whence comest thou? What
  is thy country? And of what people art thou?”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>And he said unto them, “I am a Hebrew; and I fear the LORD, the God of
  heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry land.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him, “Why hast thou
  done this?” For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the LORD,
  because he had told them.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>Then said they unto him, “What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may
  be calm unto us?” For the sea wrought, and was tempestuous.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>And he said unto them, “Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so
  shall the sea be calm unto you; for I know that for my sake this great
  tempest is upon you.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land; but they could
  not; for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous against them.
  </span><verse>14</verse><span>Wherefore they cried unto the LORD, and said, “We beseech thee, O Lord,
  we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man’s life, and lay not upon
  us innocent blood; for thou, O Lord, hast done as it pleased
  thee.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea; and the sea
  ceased from her raging.
  </span><verse>16</verse><span>Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice unto
  the LORD, and made vows.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>Now the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah
  was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.
 </span></block>

 <chapter>2
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish’s belly,
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>and said:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>
    I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and he heard me;</span></indent><span>
    out of the belly of hell cried I,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and thou heardest my voice.</span></indent>
    <verse>3</verse><span>For thou hadst cast me into the deep,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>in the midst of the seas;</span></indent>
   </block>

   <block><span>
    and the floods compassed me about;</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>all thy billows and thy waves passed over me.</span></indent>
    <verse>4</verse><span>Then I said, ‘I am cast out of thy sight;</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>yet I will look again toward thy holy temple.’</span></indent>
    <verse>5</verse><span>The waters compassed me about, even to the soul;</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>the depth closed me round about,</span></indent>
    <indent><span>the weeds were wrapped about my head.</span></indent>
    <verse>6</verse><span>I went down to the bottoms of the mountains;</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>the earth with her bars was about me forever;</span></indent>
    <indent><span>yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption, O Lord my God.</span></indent>
   </block>

   <block>
    <verse>7</verse><span>When my soul fainted within me</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>I remembered the LORD;</span></indent><span>
    and my prayer came in unto thee,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>into thine holy temple.</span></indent>
   </block>

   <block>
    <verse>8</verse><span>They that observe lying vanities</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>forsake their own mercy.</span></indent>
    <verse>9</verse><span>But I will sacrifice unto thee</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>with the voice of thanksgiving;</span></indent><span>
    I will pay that that I have vowed.</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>Salvation is of the LORD.</span></indent>

 <chapter>3

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time, saying:</span><quote>
   <verse>2</verse><span>Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the
   preaching that I bid thee.</span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the
  LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days’ journey.
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And Jonah began to enter into the city a day’s journey and he cried,
  and said, “Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put
  on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne,
  and he laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat
  in ashes.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the
  decree of the king and his nobles, saying:</span><quote><span>
   Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock taste anything; let them not
   feed, nor drink water;
   </span><verse>8</verse><span>but let man and beast be
   covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God; yea, let them turn
   everyone from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands.
   </span><verse>9</verse><span>Who can tell, if we will repent, and turn
   </span><dunder><span>unto God, but he will turn</span></dunder><span>
   away from
   </span><dunder><span>us</span></dunder><span>
   his fierce anger,
   that we perish not?
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>And God saw their works that they turned from
  their evil way
  </span><dunder><span>and repented</span></dunder><span>; and God
  </span><under>
   <note><span>repented of</span></note><span>turned away</span></under><span>
  the evil
  that he had said he would bring upon them.
 </span></block>

 <chapter>4
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And he prayed unto the lord, and said:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>
    I pray thee, O LORD, was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country?
    Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish; for I knew that thou art a gracious
    God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest
    thee of the evil.
    </span><verse>3</verse><span>Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for it is
    better for me to die than to live.</span></block>

  </quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Then said the LORD, “Doest thou well to be angry?”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city,
  and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he
  might see what would become of the city.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah,
  that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his grief.
  So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd.
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it
  smote the gourd that it withered.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a
  vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he
  fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, “It is better for me to
  die than to live.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>And God said to Jonah, “Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd?”
 </span></block>

 <block><span>And he said, “I do well to be angry, even unto death.”</span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>Then said the LORD:</span><quote><span>
   Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the which thou hast not labored,
   neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night;
   </span><verse>11</verse><span>and should not I spare Nineveh, that great
   city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern
   between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first
  day of the month; came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet unto
  Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the
  son of Josedech, the high priest, saying:</span><quote>
   <verse>2</verse><span>Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying: This people say, ‘The time is
   not come, the time that the LORD’s house should be built.’</span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>Then came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying:
  </span><quote>
   <block>
    <verse>4</verse><span>Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your ceiled houses, and this
    house lie waste?</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>5</verse><span>Now therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts: Consider your ways.
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not enough;
    ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe you, but there is
    none warm; and he that earneth wages, earneth wages to put it into a bag
    with holes.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>7</verse><span>Thus saith the LORD of hosts: Consider your ways.
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will
    take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith the LORD.
    </span><verse>9</verse><span>Ye looked for much, and, lo, it came to little; and when ye brought it
    home, I did blow upon it. Why? saith the LORD of hosts. Because of mine
    house that is waste, and ye run every man unto his own house.
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the earth is
    stayed from her fruit.
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and
    upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil, and upon that
    which the ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon cattle, and upon
    all the labor of the hands.</span></block>

 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Josedech,
  the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of
  the LORD their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the LORD
  their God had sent him, and the people did fear before the LORD.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>Then spake Haggai the LORD’s messenger in the LORD’s message unto the
  people, saying: “I am with you, saith the LORD.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel,
  governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Josedech, the
  high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they
  came and did work in the house of the LORD of hosts, their God,
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>in the four and twentieth day of the sixth month, in the second year of
  Darius the king.

 <chapter>2

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>In the seventh month, in the one and twentieth day of the month, came
  the word of the LORD by the prophet Haggai, saying:
  </span><quote>
   <block>
    <verse>2</verse><span>Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to
    Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and to the residue of the
    people, saying,
    </span><verse>3</verse><span>‘Who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory? And how
    do ye see it now? Is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing?
    </span><verse>4</verse><span>Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel,’ saith the LORD, ‘and be strong, O
    Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest; and be strong, all ye people
    of the land,’ saith the LORD, ‘and work; for I am with you,’ saith the
    LORD of hosts;
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>‘according to the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of
    Egypt, so my spirit remaineth among you; fear ye not.’</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>6</verse><span>For thus saith the LORD of hosts, ‘Yet once, it is a little while, and
    I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land;
    </span><verse>7</verse><span>and I will shake all nations, and the Desire of all nations shall come;
    and I will fill this house with glory,’ saith the LORD of hosts.
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>‘The silver is mine, and the gold
    is mine,’ saith the LORD of hosts.
    </span><verse>9</verse><span>‘The glory of
    this latter house shall be greater than of the former,’ saith the LORD of
    hosts; ‘and in this place will I give peace,’ saith the LORD of hosts.

  <verse>10</verse><span>In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, in the second year of
  Darius, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying:
  </span><quote>
   <verse>11</verse><span>Thus saith the LORD of hosts, “Ask now the priests concerning the law,
   saying,
   </span><verse>12</verse><span>‘If
   one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do
   touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat, shall it be holy?’”
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And the priests answered and said, “No.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>Then said Haggai, “If one that is unclean by a dead body touch any of
  these, shall it be unclean?” And the priests answered and said, “It
  shall be unclean.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>Then answered Haggai, and said:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>
    ‘So is this people, and so is this nation before me,’ saith the LORD; ‘and
    so is every work of their hands; and that which they offer there is
    unclean.
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>And now, I pray you, consider from
    this day and upward, from before a stone was laid upon a stone in the
    temple of the LORD;
    </span><verse>16</verse><span>since those days were, when
    one came to a heap of twenty measures, there were but ten; when one came
    to the pressfat for to draw out fifty vessels out of the press, there were
    but twenty.
    </span><verse>17</verse><span>I smote you with blasting and with
    mildew and with hail in all the labors of your hands; yet ye turned not to
    me,’ saith the LORD.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>18</verse><span>Consider now from this day and upward, from the four and twentieth day
    of the ninth month, even from the day that the foundation of the LORD’s
    temple was laid, consider it.
    </span><verse>19</verse><span>Is the seed yet in the barn? Yea, as yet the vine, and the fig tree,
    and the pomegranate, and the olive tree, hath not brought forth; from
    this day will I bless you.</span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>And again the word of the LORD came unto Haggai in the four and

   <verse>21</verse><span>Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, ‘I will shake the
   heavens and the earth;
   </span><verse>22</verse><span>and I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the
   strength of the kingdoms of the heathen; and I will overthrow the
   chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders
   shall come down, every one by the sword of his brother.
   </span><verse>23</verse><span>In that day,’ saith the LORD of hosts, ‘will I take thee, O Zerubbabel,

   <verse>8</verse><span>I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood

  Gold candlestick and two olive trees

 <chapter>4

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man
  that is wakened out of his sleep,
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>and said unto me, “What seest thou?”
 </span></block>

 <block><span>
  And I said, “I have looked, and behold a candlestick all of gold, with a
  bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to
  the seven lamps, which are upon the top thereof;
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>and two olive trees by it, one upon the right

 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>Then he answered and spake unto me, saying:</span><quote><span>
   This is the word of the LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying, ‘Not by might, nor

   </span><verse>7</verse><span>Who art thou, O great mountain? Before
   Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain; and he shall bring forth the

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</span><quote>
   <verse>9</verse><span>The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his

   hath sent me unto you.
   </span><verse>10</verse><span>For who hath despised the day of small things? For they shall rejoice,

  <verse>11</verse><span>Then answered I, and said unto him, “What are these two olive trees

  branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of
  themselves?”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>And he answered me and said, “Knowest thou not what these be?” And I

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Then I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a flying roll.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>And he said unto me, “What seest thou?” And I answered, “I see a flying
  roll; the length
  thereof is twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>Then said he unto me:</span><quote><span>
   This is the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth; for
   every one that stealeth shall be cut off as on this side according to it;
   and every one that sweareth shall be cut off as on that side according to
   it.
   </span><verse>4</verse><span>I will bring it forth, saith the LORD of
   hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house
   of him that sweareth falsely by my name; and it shall remain in the midst
   of his house, and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones
   thereof.

  <verse>5</verse><span>Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said unto me, “Lift

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And I said, “What is it?” And he said, “This is an ephah that goeth
  forth.” He said moreover, “This is their resemblance through all the

 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>And, behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead; and this is a woman
  that sitteth in the midst of the ephah.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>And he said, “This is wickedness.” And he cast it into the midst of the
  ephah; and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>Then lifted I up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came out two
  women, and the wind was in their wings; for they had wings like the

  heaven.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>Then said I to the angel that talked with me, “Whither do these bear

 <chapter>6

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there
  came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains
  were mountains of brass.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second chariot black
  horses;
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>and in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot

  <verse>7</verse><span>And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and

  <verse>8</verse><span>Then cried he upon me, and spake unto me, saying, “Behold, these that

  <verse>9</verse><span>And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:</span><quote>

   of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest;
   </span><verse>12</verse><span>and speak unto him, saying, “Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying,
   ‘Behold the man whose name is The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of

 <chapter>7
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that the word of
  the LORD came unto Zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth month, even
  in Chisleu;
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>when they had sent unto the house of God Sherezer and Regemmelech, and
  their men, to pray before the LORD,
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>and to speak unto the priests which were in the house of the LORD of
  hosts, and to the prophets, saying, “Should I weep in the fifth month,
  separating myself, as I have done these so many years?”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Then came the word of the LORD of hosts unto me, saying:</span><quote>
   <verse>5</verse><span>Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying,
   ‘When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month, even those
   seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me, even to me?
   </span><verse>6</verse><span>And when ye did eat, and when ye did drink, did not ye eat for
   yourselves, and drink for yourselves?
   </span><verse>7</verse><span>Should ye not hear the words which the LORD hath cried by the former
   prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and the cities
   thereof round about her, when men inhabited the south and the
   plain?’</span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>And the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah, saying:
  </span><quote>
   <block>
    <verse>9</verse><span>Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, ‘Execute true judgment, and
    shew mercy and compassions every man to his brother;
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>and oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the
    poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your
    heart.’</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>11</verse><span>But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped
    their ears, that they should not hear.
    </span><verse>12</verse><span>Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should hear
    the law, and the words which the LORD of hosts hath sent in his spirit
    by the former prophets; therefore came a great wrath from the LORD of
    hosts.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>13</verse><span>Therefore it is come to pass, that as he cried, and they would not
    hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the LORD of hosts;
    </span><verse>14</verse><span>but I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they
    knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them, that no man passed
    through nor returned; for they laid the pleasant land desolate.</span></block>

 <chapter>8
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Again the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying:
  </span><quote>
   <block>
    <verse>2</verse><span>Thus saith the LORD of hosts: I was jealous for Zion with great
    jealousy, and I was jealous for her with great fury.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>3</verse><span>Thus saith the LORD: I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell in the

    the mountain of the LORD of hosts the holy mountain.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>4</verse><span>Thus saith the LORD of hosts: There shall yet old men and old women
    dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and every man with his staff in his
    hand for very age.
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in
    the streets thereof.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>6</verse><span>Thus saith the LORD of hosts: If it be marvelous in the eyes of the
    remnant of this people in these days, should it also be marvelous in
    mine eyes? Saith the LORD of hosts.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>7</verse><span>Thus saith the LORD of hosts: Behold, I will gather my people from the
    east country, and from the west country;
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>and I will bring them, and they shall dwell in
    the midst of Jerusalem; and they shall be my people, and I will be their
    God, in truth and in righteousness.
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>9</verse><span>Thus saith the LORD of hosts: Let your hands be strong, ye that hear in
    these days these words by the mouth of the prophets, which were in the
    day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, that
    the temple might be built.
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for
    beast; neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in
    because of the affliction; for I set all men every one against his
    neighbor.
    </span><verse>11</verse><span>But now I will not be unto the residue of this people as in the former
    days, saith the LORD of hosts.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>12</verse><span>For the seed shall be prosperous; the vine shall give her fruit, and
    the ground shall give her increase, and the heavens shall give their
    dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these
    things.
    </span><verse>13</verse><span>And it shall come to pass, that as ye were a curse among the heathen, O
    house of Judah, and house of Israel; so will I gather you, and ye shall
    be a blessing; fear not, but let your hands be strong.</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>14</verse><span>For thus saith the LORD of hosts; As I thought to punish you, when your
    fathers provoked me to wrath, saith the LORD of hosts, and I repented
    not;
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>so again have I thought in these days to do well unto Jerusalem and to
    the house of Judah; fear ye not.
    </span><verse>16</verse><span>These are the things that ye shall do: Speak ye every man the truth to
    his neighbor; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates;
    </span><verse>17</verse><span>and let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbor;
    and love no false oath; for all these are things that I hate, saith the

  Two shepherds

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Thus saith the LORD my God: Feed the flock of the slaughter;
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty; and they
  that sell them say, ‘Blessed be the LORD; for I am rich;’ and their own
  shepherds pity them not.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD,
  but, lo, I will deliver the men every one into his neighbor’s hand, and
  into the hand of his king; and they shall smite the land, and out of
  their hand I will not deliver them.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>And I will feed the flock of slaughter, even you, O poor of the flock.
  And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I
  called Bands; and I fed the flock.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul loathed them,
  and their soul also abhorred me.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>Then said I, “I will not feed you; that that dieth, let it die; and
  that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest eat
  every one the flesh of another.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>And I took my staff, even Beauty, and cut it assunder, that I might
  break my covenant which I had made with all the people.
  </span><verse>11</verse><span>And it was broken in that day; and so the poor of the flock that waited
  upon me knew that it was the word of the LORD.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>And I said unto them, “If ye think good, give me my price; and if not,
  forbear.” So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>And the LORD said unto me, “Cast it unto the potter;” a goodly price
  that I was prised at of them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver,
  and cast them to the potter in the house of the LORD.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>Then I cut asunder mine other staff, even Bands, that I might break the
  brotherhood between Judah and Israel.

   <block><span>
    Take unto thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd.
    </span><verse>16</verse><span>For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the
    land, which shall not visit those that be cut off, neither shall seek the
    young one, nor heal that that is broken, nor feed that that standeth
    still; but he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear their claws in

  proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble; and the day that
  cometh shall burn them up,” saith the LORD of hosts, “that it shall

  with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves
  of the stall.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the
  soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this,” saith the LORD of
  hosts.
