 <heading><span>
  The Lord’s anger against Nineveh
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>God is jealous, and the LORD revengeth;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the LORD revengeth, and is furious;</span></indent><span>
  The LORD will take vengeance on his adversaries,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and he reserveth wrath for his enemies.</span></indent>
  <verse>3</verse><span>The LORD is slow to anger, and great in power,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and will not at all acquit the wicked;</span></indent><span>
  the LORD hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the clouds are the dust of his feet.</span></indent>
  <verse>4</verse><span>He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and drieth up all the rivers;</span></indent><span>
  Bashan languisheth, and Carmel,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the flower of Lebanon languisheth.</span></indent>
  <verse>5</verse><span>The mountains quake at him,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the hills melt,</span></indent><span>
  and the earth is burned at his presence,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>yea, the world, and all that dwell therein.</span></indent>
  <verse>6</verse><span>Who can stand before his indignation?</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>And who can abide in the fierceness of his anger?</span></indent><span>
  His fury is poured out like fire,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the rocks are thrown down by him.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>The LORD is good,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>a strong hold in the day of trouble;</span></indent><span>
  and he knoweth them that trust in him.</span><break></break>
  <indent>
   <verse>8</verse><span>But with an everrunning flood</span></indent><span>
  he will make an utter end of the place thereof,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and darkness shall pursue his enemies.</span></indent>
  <verse>9</verse><span>What do ye imagine against the LORD?</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>He will make an utter end;</span></indent>
  <indent><span>affliction shall not rise up the second time.</span></indent>
  <verse>10</verse><span>For while they be folded together as thorns,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and while they are drunken as drunkards,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>they shall be devoured as stubble fully dry.</span></indent>
  <verse>11</verse><span>There is one come out of thee,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>that imagineth evil against the LORD,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>a wicked counselor.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>Thus saith the LORD, “Though they be quiet, and likewise many,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>yet thus shall they be cut down, when he shall pass through.</span></indent><span>
  Though I have afflicted thee,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>I will afflict thee no more.</span></indent>
  <verse>13</verse><span>For now will I break his yoke from off thee,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and will burst thy bonds in sunder.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>And the LORD hath given a commandment concerning thee,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>that no more of thy name be sown;</span></indent><span>
  out of the house of thy gods</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>will I cut off the graven image and the molten image;</span></indent><span>
  I will make thy grave;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>for thou art vile.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>Behold upon the mountains</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the feet of him that bringeth good tidings,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>that publisheth peace;</span></indent><span>
  O Judah, keep thy solemn feasts,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>perform thy vows;</span></indent><span>
  for the wicked shall no more pass through thee;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he is utterly cut off.</span></indent>

  <verse>2</verse><span>For the LORD hath turned away the excellency of Jacob,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>as the excellency of Israel;</span></indent><span>

  <indent><span>and marred their vine branches.</span></indent>

  <verse>3</verse><span>The shield of his mighty men is made red,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the valiant men are in scarlet;</span></indent><span>
  the chariots shall be with flaming torches in the day of his preparation,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken.</span></indent>
  <verse>4</verse><span>The chariots shall rage in the streets,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>they shall justle one against another in the broad ways;</span></indent><span>
  they shall seem like torches,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>they shall run like the lightnings.</span></indent>

  <verse>5</verse><span>He shall recount his worthies;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>they shall stumble in their walk;</span></indent><span>

  <indent><span>and the defense shall be prepared.</span></indent>
  <verse>6</verse><span>The gates of the rivers shall be opened,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the palace shall be dissolved.</span></indent>
  <verse>7</verse><span>And Huzzab shall be led away captive,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>she shall be brought up,</span></indent><span>
  and her maids shall lead her as with the voice of doves,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>tabering upon their breasts.</span></indent>
  <verse>8</verse><span>But Nineveh is of old like a pool of water;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>yet they shall flee away.</span></indent><span>
  ‘Stand, stand,’ shall they cry;</span><break></break>

  <verse>10</verse><span>She is empty, and void, and waste;</span><break></break>

  <verse>11</verse><span>Where is the dwelling of the lions,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the feeding-place of the young lions,</span></indent><span>
  where the lion, even the old lion, walked,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the lion’s whelp, and none made them afraid?</span></indent>
  <verse>12</verse><span>The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and strangled for his lionesses,</span></indent><span>
  and filled his holes with prey,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and his dens with ravin.</span></indent>

  <verse>13</verse><span>“Behold, I am against thee,”</span><break></break>

  <indent><span>and the sword shall devour thy young lions;</span></indent><span>
  and I will cut off thy prey from the earth,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard.”</span></indent>

  <indent><span>she went into captivity;</span></indent><span>
  her young children also were dashed in pieces</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>at the top of all the streets;</span></indent><span>
