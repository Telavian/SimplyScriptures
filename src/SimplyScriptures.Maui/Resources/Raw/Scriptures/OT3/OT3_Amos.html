  <verse>1</verse><span>The words of Amos, who was among the herdmen of Tekoa, which he saw
  concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days
  of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the
  earthquake.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>And he said:</span><break></break>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  The LORD will roar from Zion,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and utter his voice from Jerusalem;</span></indent><span>
  and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the top of Carmel shall wither.</span></indent>

  Judgment against Israel’s neighbors
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>Thus saith the LORD: For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>I will not turn away the punishment thereof;</span></indent><span>
  because they have threshed Gilead</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>with threshing instruments of iron;</span></indent>
  <verse>4</verse><span>but I will send a fire into the house of Hazael,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>which shall devour the palaces of Ben-Hadad.</span></indent>
  <verse>5</verse><span>I will break also the bar of Damascus,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and cut off the inhabitant from the plain of Aven,</span></indent><span>
  and him that holdeth the scepter from the house of Eden;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the people of Syria shall go into captivity unto Kir, saith the LORD.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>Thus saith the LORD: For three transgressions of Gaza, and for four,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>I will not turn away the punishment thereof;</span></indent><span>
  because they carried away captive the whole captivity,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>to deliver them up to Edom;</span></indent>
  <verse>7</verse><span>but I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>which shall devour the palaces thereof;</span></indent>
  <verse>8</verse><span>and I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and him that holdeth the scepter from Ashkelon,</span></indent><span>
  and I will turn mine hand against Ekron;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish, saith the Lord GOD.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>Thus saith the LORD: For three transgressions of Tyrus, and for four,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>I will not turn away the punishment thereof;</span></indent><span>
  because they delivered up the whole captivity to Edom,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and remembered not the brotherly covenant;</span></indent>
  <verse>10</verse><span>but I will send a fire on the wall of Tyrus,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>which shall devour the palaces thereof.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>Thus saith the LORD: For three transgressions of Edom, and for four,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>I will not turn away the punishment thereof;</span></indent><span>
  because he did pursue his brother with the sword,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and did cast off all pity,</span></indent><span>
  and his anger did tear perpetually,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and he kept his wrath forever;</span></indent>
  <verse>12</verse><span>but I will send a fire upon Teman,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>which shall devour the palaces of Bozrah.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>Thus saith the LORD: For three transgressions of the children of Ammon, and for four,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>I will not turn away the punishment thereof;</span></indent><span>
  because they have ripped up the women with child, of Gilead,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>that they might enlarge their border;</span></indent>
  <verse>14</verse><span>but I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and it shall devour the palaces thereof,</span></indent><span>
  with shouting in the day of battle,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind;</span></indent>
  <verse>15</verse><span>and their king shall go into captivity,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he and his princes together, saith the LORD.</span></indent>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Thus saith the LORD: For three transgressions of Moab, and for four,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>I will not turn away the punishment thereof;</span></indent>
  <indent><span>because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime;</span></indent>
  <verse>2</verse><span>But I will send a fire upon Moab,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and it shall devour the palaces of Kirioth;</span></indent><span>
  and Moab shall die with tumult,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet;</span></indent>
  <verse>3</verse><span>and I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and will slay all the princes thereof with him, saith the LORD.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Thus saith the LORD: For three transgressions of Judah, and for four,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>I will not turn away the punishment thereof;</span></indent><span>
  because they have despised the law of the LORD,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and have not kept his commandments,</span></indent><span>
  and their lies caused them to err,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>after the which their fathers have walked;</span></indent>
  <verse>5</verse><span>but I will send a fire upon Judah,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>Thus saith the LORD: For three transgressions of Israel, and for four,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>I will not turn away the punishment thereof;</span></indent><span>
  because they sold the righteous for silver,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the poor for a pair of shoes;</span></indent>
  <verse>7</verse><span>that pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and turn aside the way of the meek;</span></indent><span>
  and a man and his father will go in unto the same maid,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>to profane my holy name;</span></indent>
  <verse>8</verse><span>and they lay themselves down upon clothes laid to pledge by every altar,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and they drink the wine of the condemned in the house of their god.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>whose height was like the height of the cedars,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and he was strong as the oaks;</span></indent><span>
  yet I destroyed his fruit from above,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and his roots from beneath.</span></indent>
  <verse>10</verse><span>Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and led you forty years through the wilderness,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>to possess the land of the Amorite.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>And I raised up of your sons for prophets,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and of your young men for Nazarites.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  Is it not even thus, O ye children of Israel? Saith the LORD.</span><break></break>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and commanded the prophets, saying, “Prophesy not.”</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>Behold, I am pressed under you,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>as a cart is pressed that is full of sheaves.</span></indent>
  <verse>14</verse><span>Therefore the flight shall perish from the swift,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the strong shall not strengthen his force,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>neither shall the mighty deliver himself.</span></indent>
  <verse>15</verse><span>Neither shall he stand that handleth the bow;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and he that is swift of foot shall not deliver himself;</span></indent>
  <indent><span>neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself.</span></indent>
  <verse>16</verse><span>And he that is courageous among the mighty</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>shall flee away naked in that day, saith the LORD.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <chapter>3
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Hear this word that the LORD hath spoken against you, O children of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt, saying:</span><break></break>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>You only have I known of all the families of the earth;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>Can two walk together, except they be agreed?</span><break></break>
  <indent>
   <verse>4</verse><span>Will a lion roar in the forest, when he hath no prey?</span></indent><span>
  Will a young lion cry out of his den, if he have taken nothing?</span><break></break>
  <indent>
   <verse>5</verse><span>Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth, where no gin is for him?</span></indent><span>
  Shall one take up a snare from the earth, and have taken nothing at all?</span><break></break>
  <indent>
   <verse>6</verse><span>Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid?</span></indent><span>
  Shall there be evil in a city, and the LORD hath not known it?</span><break></break>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>until he revealeth the secret unto his servants the prophets.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>The lion hath roared, who will not fear?</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>The Lord GOD hath spoken, who can but prophesy?</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>Publish in the palaces at Ashdod,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and in the palaces in the land of Egypt,</span></indent><span>
  and say, “Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and behold the great tumults in the midst thereof,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and the oppressed in the midst thereof.”</span></indent>
  <verse>10</verse><span>“For they know not to do right,” saith the LORD,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>“who store up violence and robbery in their palaces.”</span></indent>
  <verse>11</verse><span>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, “An adversary there shall be even round about the land;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and he shall bring down thy strength from thee,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and thy palaces shall be spoiled.”</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>Thus saith the LORD, “As the shepherd taketh out of the mouth of the lion two legs,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>or a piece of an ear;</span></indent><span>
  so shall the children of Israel be taken out</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>that dwell in Samaria in the corner of a bed,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and in Damascus in a couch.”</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>“Hear ye, and testify in the house of Jacob,” saith the Lord GOD, the God of hosts,</span><break></break>
  <indent>
   <verse>14</verse><span>“that, in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel upon him,</span></indent><span>
  I will also visit the altars of Beth-El;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the horns of the altar shall be cut off,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and fall to the ground.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>“And I will smite the winter house with the summer house;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the houses of ivory shall perish,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and the great houses shall have an end,” saith the LORD.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <chapter>4
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Hear this word, ye kine of Bashan, that are in the mountain of Samaria,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>which oppress the poor, which crush the needy,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>which say to their masters, “Bring, and let us drink.”</span></indent>
  <verse>2</verse><span>The Lord GOD hath sworn by his holiness, that, lo,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>“The days shall come upon you,</span></indent><span>
  that he will take you away with hooks,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and your posterity with fishhooks.</span></indent>
  <verse>3</verse><span>And ye shall go out at the breaches,</span><break></break>
  <indent>
   <note><span>every cow at that which is before her; and ye shall cast them into the palace</span></note>
   <under><span>everyone before his enemy</span></under><span>;</span></indent>
  <indent>
   <under><span>and ye shall be cast out of your palaces</span></under><span>,” saith the LORD.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>“Come to Beth-El, and transgress;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>at Gilgal multiply transgression;</span></indent><span>
  and bring your sacrifices every morning,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and your tithes after three years;</span></indent>
  <verse>5</verse><span>And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and proclaim and publish the free offerings;</span></indent>
  <indent><span>for thus do ye, O ye children of Israel,” saith the Lord GOD.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>“Therefore I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and want of bread in all your places;</span></indent>
  <indent><span>yet have ye not returned unto me,” saith the LORD.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>“And also I have withholden the rain from you,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>when there were yet three months to the harvest;</span></indent><span>
  and I caused it to rain upon one city,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and caused it not to rain upon another city;</span></indent><span>
  one piece was rained upon,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the piece whereupon it rained not withered.</span></indent>
  <verse>8</verse><span>So two or three cities wandered unto one city, to drink water;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>but they were not satisfied;</span></indent>
  <indent><span>yet have ye not returned unto me,” saith the LORD.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>“I have smitten you with blasting and mildew;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>when your gardens and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees</span></indent>
  <indent><span>increased,</span></indent><span>
  the palmerworm devoured them;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>yet have ye not returned unto me,” saith the LORD.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>your young men have I slain with the sword,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and have taken away your horses;</span></indent><span>
  and I have made the stink of your camps to come up unto your nostrils;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>yet have ye not returned unto me,” saith the LORD.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>“I have overthrown some of you,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah,</span></indent><span>
  ﻿and ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>yet have ye not returned unto me,” saith the LORD.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and because I will do this unto thee,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>For, lo, he that formeth the mountains,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and createth the wind,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and declareth unto man what is his thought,</span></indent><span>
  that maketh the morning darkness,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and treadeth upon the high places of the earth,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>the LORD, the God of hosts, is his name.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <chapter>5
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Hear ye this word which I take up against you, even a lamentation, O house of Israel.</span><break></break>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>The virgin of Israel is fallen;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>she shall no more rise;</span></indent><span>
  she is forsaken upon her land;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>there is none to raise her up.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>For thus saith the Lord GOD,</span><break></break><span>
  “The city that went out by a thousand shall leave a hundred,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and that which went forth by a hundred shall leave ten, to the house of Israel.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>For thus saith the LORD unto the house of Israel,</span><break></break><span>
  “Seek ye me, and ye shall live.</span><break></break>
  <indent>
   <verse>5</verse><span>But seek not Beth-El,</span></indent><span>
  nor enter into Gilgal,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and pass not to Beersheba;</span></indent><span>
  for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and Beth-El shall come to naught.</span></indent>
  <verse>6</verse><span>Seek the LORD, and ye shall live;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and devour it,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and there be none to quench it in Bethel.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>Ye who turn judgment to wormwood,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and leave off righteousness in the earth,</span></indent>
  <verse>8</verse><span>Seek him that maketh the seven stars and Orion,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and turneth the shadow of death into the morning,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and maketh the day dark with night;</span></indent><span>
  that calleth for the waters of the sea,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and poureth them out upon the face of the earth;</span></indent>
  <indent><span>The LORD is his name.</span></indent>
  <verse>9</verse><span>That strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>so that the spoiled shall come against the fortress.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>They hate him that rebuketh in the gate,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>Forasmuch therefore as your treading is upon the poor,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and ye take from him burdens of wheat;</span></indent><span>
  ye have built houses of hewn stone,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>but ye shall not dwell in them;</span></indent><span>
  ye have planted pleasant vineyards,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>but ye shall not drink wine of them.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>they afflict the just, they take a bribe,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and they turn aside the poor in the gate from their right.</span></indent>
  <verse>13</verse><span>Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>for it is an evil time.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>Seek good, and not evil,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>that ye may live;</span></indent><span>
  and so the LORD, the God of hosts, shall be with you,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>as ye have spoken.</span></indent>
  <verse>15</verse><span>Hate the evil, and love the good,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and establish judgment in the gate;</span></indent><span>
  it may be that the LORD God of hosts will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph.</span><break></break>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>Therefore the LORD, the God of hosts, the LORD, saith thus:</span><break></break><span>
  “Wailing shall be in all streets;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and they shall say in all the highways, ‘Alas! Alas!’</span></indent><span>
  And they shall call the husbandman to mourning,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and such as are skillful of lamentation to wailing.</span></indent>
  <verse>17</verse><span>And in all vineyards shall be wailing;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>for I will pass through thee,” saith the LORD.</span></indent>
 </block>

  The day of the Lord
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>Woe unto you that desire the day of the LORD! To what end is it for you?</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>The day of the LORD is darkness, and not light.</span></indent>
  <verse>19</verse><span>As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.</span></indent>
  <verse>20</verse><span>Shall not the day of the LORD be darkness, and not light?</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>Even very dark, and no brightness in it?</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>I hate, I despise your feast days,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies.</span></indent>
  <verse>22</verse><span>Though ye offer me burnt offering and your meat offerings,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>I will not accept them;</span></indent>
  <indent><span>neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts.</span></indent>
  <verse>23</verse><span>Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>for I will not hear the melody of thy viols.</span></indent>
  <verse>24</verse><span>But let judgment run down as waters,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and righteousness as a mighty stream.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>25</verse><span>“Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?</span></indent>
  <verse>26</verse><span>But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves.</span></indent>
  <verse>27</verse><span>Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus,”</span><break></break>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Woe to them that are at ease in Zion,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and trust in the mountain of Samaria,</span></indent><span>
  which are named chief of the nations,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>to whom the house of Israel came!</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>Pass ye unto Calneh, and see;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and from thence go ye to Hamath the great;</span></indent><span>

  <indent><span>be they better than these kingdoms?</span></indent>
  <indent><span>Or their border greater than your border?</span></indent>
  <verse>3</verse><span>Ye that put far away the evil day,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and cause the seat of violence to come near;</span></indent>
  <verse>4</verse><span>that lie upon beds of ivory,</span><break></break>

  and eat the lambs out of the flock,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the calves out of the midst of the stall;</span></indent>
  <verse>5</verse><span>that chant to the sound of the viol,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and invent to themselves instruments of music, like David;</span></indent>
  <verse>6</verse><span>that drink wine in bowls,</span><break></break>

  Locusts, fire, and a plumb line

 <chapter>7

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Thus hath the Lord GOD showed unto me; and, behold, he formed
  grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth;
  and, lo, it was the latter growth after the king’s mowings.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And it came to pass, that when they had made an end of eating the
  grass of the land, then I said, “O Lord God, forgive, I beseech thee; by
  whom shall Jacob arise? For he is small.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><note><span>The LORD repented for this: It shall not be</span></note>

  shall repent for this, therefore I will not utterly
  destroy him,” saith the LORD</span></under><span>.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Thus hath the Lord GOD showed unto me; and, behold, the Lord GOD called
  to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and did eat up a
  part.
  </span><verse>5</verse><span>Then said I, “O Lord God, cease, I beseech thee; by whom shall Jacob
  arise? For he is small.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><note>
   <note><span>The LORD repented for this: This also shall not be</span></note>

  <under><span>And the Lord said, concerning Jacob, “Jacob

 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>Thus he showed me; and, behold, the LORD stood upon a wall made by a
  plumb line, with a plumb line in his hand.
  </span><verse>8</verse><span>And the LORD said unto me, “Amos, what seest thou?” And I said, “A
  plumb line.” Then said the LORD, “Behold, I will set a plumb line in the
  midst of my people Israel; I will not again pass by them anymore;
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>and the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of
  Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of
  Jeroboam with the sword.”

  Amaziah
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>Then Amaziah the priest of Beth-El sent to Jeroboam king of Israel,
  saying:</span><quote><span>
   Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel; the
   land is not able to bear all his words.
   </span><verse>11</verse><span>For
   thus Amos saith, ‘Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely
   be led away captive out of their own land.’
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>Also Amaziah said unto Amos:</span><quote><span>
   O thou seer, go, flee thee away into the land of Judah, and there eat
   bread, and prophesy there;
   </span><verse>13</verse><span>but prophesy not
   again anymore at Beth-El; for it is the king’s chapel, and it is the
   king’s court.
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah:</span><quote><span>
   I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet’s son; but I was a herdman, and
   a gatherer of sycamore fruit;
   </span><verse>15</verse><span>and the LORD took
   me as I followed the flock, and the LORD said unto me, ‘Go prophesy unto
   my people Israel.’
   </span><verse>16</verse><span>Now therefore hear thou the
   word of the LORD: Thou sayest, ‘Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not
   thy word against the house of Isaac.’
   </span><verse>17</verse><span>Therefore
   thus saith the LORD: Thy wife shall be a harlot in the city, and thy sons
   and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided
   by line; and thou shalt die in a polluted land; and Israel shall surely go
   into captivity forth of his land.

  <verse>1</verse><span>Thus hath the Lord GOD showed unto me; and behold a basket of summer
  fruit.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And
  he said, “Amos, what seest thou?” And I said, “A basket of summer fruit.”
  Then said the LORD with me:
  </span><quote><span>
   The end is come upon my people of Israel; I will not again pass by them
   anymore.
   </span><verse>3</verse><span>And the songs of the temple shall be
   howlings in that day, saith the Lord GOD; there shall be many dead bodies
   in every place; they shall cast them forth with silence.
