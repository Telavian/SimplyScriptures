 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>The word of the LORD that came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.</span><break></break>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>Hear, all ye people;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>hearken, O earth, and all that therein is;</span></indent><span>
  and let the Lord GOD be witness against you,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the LORD from his holy temple.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>For, behold, the LORD cometh forth out of his place,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and will come down and tread upon the high places of the earth.</span></indent>
  <verse>4</verse><span>And the mountains shall be molten under him,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the valleys shall be cleft,</span></indent><span>
  as wax before the fire,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and as the waters that are poured down a steep place.</span></indent>
  <verse>5</verse><span>For the transgression of Jacob is all this,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and for the sins of the house of Israel.</span></indent><span>
  What is the transgression of Jacob?</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>Is it not Samaria?</span></indent><span>
  And what are the high places of Judah?</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>Are they not Jerusalem?</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>Therefore I will make Samaria as a heap of the field,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and as plantings of a vineyard;</span></indent><span>
  and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and I will discover the foundations thereof.</span></indent>
  <verse>7</verse><span>And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and all the idols thereof will I lay desolate;</span></indent><span>
  for she gathered it of the hire of a harlot,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and they shall return to the hire of a harlot.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>Therefore I will wail and howl,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>I will go stripped and naked;</span></indent><span>
  I will make a wailing like the dragons,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and mourning as the owls.</span></indent>
  <verse>9</verse><span>For her wound is incurable;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>for it is come unto Judah;</span></indent><span>
  he is come unto the gate of my people,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>even to Jerusalem.</span></indent>
  <verse>10</verse><span>Declare ye it not at Gath,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>weep ye not at all;</span></indent><span>
  in the house of Aphrah</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>roll thyself in the dust.</span></indent>
  <verse>11</verse><span>Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>having thy shame naked;</span></indent><span>
  the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Beth-Ezel;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he shall receive of you his standing.</span></indent>
  <verse>12</verse><span>For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>but evil came down from the LORD unto the gate of Jerusalem.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>O thou inhabitant of Lachish,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>bind the chariot to the swift beast;</span></indent><span>
  she is the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee.</span></indent>
  <verse>14</verse><span>Therefore shalt thou give presents to Moresheth-Gath;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the houses of Achzib shall be a lie to the kings of Israel.</span></indent>
  <verse>15</verse><span>Yet will I bring an heir unto thee,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>O inhabitant of Mareshah;</span></indent><span>
  he shall come unto Adullam</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the glory of Israel.</span></indent>
  <verse>16</verse><span>Make thee bald,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and poll thee for thy delicate children;</span></indent><span>
  enlarge thy baldness as the eagle;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>for they are gone into captivity from thee.</span></indent>

  <verse>1</verse><span>Woe to them that devise iniquity,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and work evil upon their beds!</span></indent><span>
  When the morning is light, they practice it,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>because it is in the power of their hand.</span></indent>
  <verse>2</verse><span>And they covet fields, and take them by violence;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and houses, and take them away;</span></indent><span>
  so they oppress a man and his house,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>even a man and his heritage.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>Therefore thus saith the LORD,</span><break></break><span>
  “Behold, against this family do I devise an evil,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>from which ye shall not remove your necks;</span></indent><span>
  neither shall ye go haughtily;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>for this time is evil.</span></indent>
  <verse>4</verse><span>In that day shall one take up a parable against you,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and lament with a doleful lamentation,</span></indent><span>
  and say, ‘We be utterly spoiled;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he hath changed the portion of my people;</span></indent><span>
  how hath he removed it from me!</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>Turning away he hath divided our fields.’”</span></indent>

  <indent><span>as an enemy;</span></indent><span>
  ye pull off the robe with the garment</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>from them that pass by securely</span></indent>
  <indent><span>as men averse from war.</span></indent>
  <verse>9</verse><span>The women of my people have ye cast out</span><break></break>

  <verse>1</verse><span>And I said,</span><break></break><span>
  Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and ye princes of the house of Israel;</span></indent><span>
  Is it not for you to know judgment?</span><break></break>
  <indent>
   <verse>2</verse><span>Who hate the good, and love the evil;</span></indent><span>
  who pluck off their skin from off them,</span><break></break>

  <verse>3</verse><span>who also eat the flesh of my people,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and flay their skin from off them;</span></indent><span>
  and they break their bones,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and chop them in pieces, as for the pot,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and as flesh within the caldron.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Then shall they cry unto the LORD,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>but he will not hear them;</span></indent><span>
  he will even hide his face from them at that time,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>Thus saith the LORD, “Concerning the prophets</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>that make my people err,</span></indent><span>
  that bite with their teeth, and cry, ‘Peace;’</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and he that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him;</span></indent>
  <verse>6</verse><span>therefore night shall be unto you, that ye shall not have a vision;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine;</span></indent><span>
  and the sun shall go down over the prophets,</span><break></break>

  <verse>7</verse><span>Then shall the seers be ashamed,</span><break></break>

  yea, they shall all cover their lips;</span><break></break>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>But truly I am full of power</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>by the Spirit of the LORD,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and of judgment, and of might,</span></indent><span>
  to declare unto Jacob his transgression,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and to Israel his sin.</span></indent>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and princes of the house of Israel,</span></indent><span>
  that abhor judgment,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and pervert all equity.</span></indent>
  <verse>10</verse><span>They build up Zion with blood,</span><break></break>

  <verse>11</verse><span>The heads thereof judge for reward,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the priests thereof teach for hire,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and the prophets thereof divine for money;</span></indent><span>
  yet will they lean upon the LORD,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and say, ‘Is not the LORD among us?</span></indent>
  <indent><span>None evil can come upon us.’</span></indent>
  <verse>12</verse><span>Therefore shall Zion for your sake be ploughed as a field,</span><break></break>

  and he will teach us of his ways,</span><break></break>

  <verse>3</verse><span>And he shall judge among many people,</span><break></break>

  nation shall not lift up a sword against nation,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>neither shall they learn war any more.</span></indent>

  <verse>10</verse><span>Be in pain, and labor to bring forth, O daughter of Zion,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>like a woman in travail;</span></indent><span>

  <indent><span>there shalt thou be delivered;</span></indent><span>
  there the LORD shall redeem thee</span><break></break>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>Now also many nations</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>are gathered against thee,</span></indent><span>

  <verse>12</verse><span>But they know not the thoughts of the LORD,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>neither understand they his counsel;</span></indent><span>

  <verse>13</verse><span>Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>for I will make thine horn iron,</span></indent><span>

  <verse>16</verse><span>For the statutes of Omri are kept,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and all the works of the house of Ahab,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and ye walk in their counsels;</span></indent><span>
  that I should make thee a desolation,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the inhabitants thereof a hissing;</span></indent>
  <indent><span>therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people.</span></indent>

  <verse>1</verse><span>Woe is me!</span><break></break><span>
  For I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>as the grape gleanings of the vintage;</span></indent><span>
  there is no cluster to eat;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>my soul desired the first ripe fruit.</span></indent>
  <verse>2</verse><span>The good man is perished out of the earth;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and there is none upright among men;</span></indent><span>
  they all lie in wait for blood;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>they hunt every man his brother with a net.</span></indent>
  <verse>3</verse><span>That they may do evil with both hands earnestly,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the prince asketh, and the judge asketh for a reward;</span></indent><span>
  and the great man, he uttereth his mischievous desire;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>so they wrap it up.</span></indent>
  <verse>4</verse><span>The best of them is as a brier;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the most upright is sharper than a thorn hedge;</span></indent><span>
  the day of thy watchman and thy visitation cometh;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>now shall be their perplexity.</span></indent>
  <verse>5</verse><span>Trust ye not in a friend,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>put ye not confidence in a guide;</span></indent><span>
  keep the doors of thy mouth</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>from her that lieth in thy bosom.</span></indent>
  <verse>6</verse><span>For the son dishonoreth the father,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the daughter riseth up against her mother,</span></indent><span>
  the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>a man’s enemies are the men of his own house.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>Therefore I will look unto the LORD;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>I will wait for the God of my salvation;</span></indent>
  <indent><span>my God will hear me.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>when I fall, I shall arise;</span></indent><span>
  when I sit in darkness,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the LORD shall be a light unto me.</span></indent>
  <verse>9</verse><span>I will bear the indignation of the LORD,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>because I have sinned against him,</span></indent><span>
  until he plead my cause,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and execute judgment for me;</span></indent><span>
  he will bring me forth to the light,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and I shall behold his righteousness.</span></indent>
  <verse>10</verse><span>Then she that is mine enemy shall see it,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and shame shall cover her</span></indent><span>
  which said unto me,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>‘Where is the LORD thy God?’</span></indent><span>
  Mine eyes shall behold her;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>now shall she be trodden down</span></indent>
  <indent><span>as the mire of the streets.</span></indent>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>In the day that thy walls are to be built,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>in that day shall the decree be far removed.</span></indent>
  <verse>12</verse><span>In that day also he shall come even to thee from Assyria,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and from the fortified cities,</span></indent><span>
  and from the fortress even to the river,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and from sea to sea,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and from mountain to mountain.</span></indent>
  <verse>13</verse><span>Notwithstanding, the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>for the fruit of their doings.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>Feed thy people with thy rod,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the flock of thine heritage,</span></indent><span>
  which dwell solitarily in the wood,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>in the midst of Carmel;</span></indent><span>
  let them feed in Bashan and Gilead,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>as in the days of old.</span></indent>

  <verse>15</verse><span>According to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>will I show unto him marvelous things.</span></indent>
  <verse>16</verse><span>The nations shall see</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and be confounded at all their might;</span></indent><span>
  they shall lay their hand upon their mouth,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>their ears shall be deaf.</span></indent>
  <verse>17</verse><span>They shall lick the dust like a serpent,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>they shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth;</span></indent><span>
  they shall be afraid of the LORD our God,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and shall fear because of thee.</span></indent>
  <verse>18</verse><span>Who is a God like unto thee,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>that pardoneth iniquity,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage?</span></indent><span>
  He retaineth not his anger for ever,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>because he delighteth in mercy.</span></indent>
  <verse>19</verse><span>He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he will subdue our iniquities;</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.</span></indent>
  <verse>20</verse><span>Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the mercy to Abraham,</span></indent><span>
  which thou hast sworn unto our fathers</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>from the days of old.</span></indent>
