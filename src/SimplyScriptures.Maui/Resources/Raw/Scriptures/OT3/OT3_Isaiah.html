  <verse>1</verse><span>The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and
  Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of
  Judah.

  A sinful nation
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>for the LORD hath spoken,</span></indent><span>
  “I have nourished and brought up children,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and they have rebelled against me.</span></indent>
  <verse>3</verse><span>The ox knoweth his owner,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the ass his master’s crib;</span></indent><span>
  but Israel doth not know,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>my people doth not consider.”</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Ah sinful nation,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>a people laden with iniquity,</span></indent><span>
  a seed of evildoers,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>children that are corrupters;</span></indent><span>
  they have forsaken the LORD,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>they are gone away backward.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>Why should ye be stricken anymore?</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>Ye will revolt more and more.</span></indent><span>
  The whole head is sick,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the whole heart faint.</span></indent>
  <verse>6</verse><span>From the sole of the foot even unto the head</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>there is no soundness in it;</span></indent><span>
  but wounds, and bruises,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and putrifying sores;</span></indent><span>
  they have not been closed; neither bound up,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>neither mollified with ointment.</span></indent>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>Your country is desolate,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>your cities are burned with fire;</span></indent><span>
  your land, strangers devour it in your presence,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.</span></indent>
  <verse>8</verse><span>And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.</span></indent>
  <verse>9</verse><span>Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>we should have been as Sodom,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and we should have been like unto Gomorrah.</span></indent>

  Meaningless offerings

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom.</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>Give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.</span></indent>
  <verse>11</verse><span>“To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me?” saith the LORD;</span><break></break><span>
  “I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.</span></indent>
  <verse>12</verse><span>When ye come to appear before me,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?</span></indent>
  <verse>13</verse><span>Bring no more vain oblations;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>incense is an abomination unto me;</span></indent><span>
  the new moons and Sabbaths, the calling of assemblies,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>I cannot away with; it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting.</span></indent>
  <verse>14</verse><span>Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.</span></indent>
  <verse>15</verse><span>And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  Your hands are full of blood.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>Wash ye, make you clean;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;</span></indent>
  <verse>17</verse><span>learn to do well; seek judgment,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>relieve the oppressed,</span></indent><span>
  judge the fatherless,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>plead for the widow.”</span></indent>

  <verse>18</verse><span>“Come now, and let us reason together,” saith the LORD.</span><break></break>

  “Though your sins be as scarlet,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>they shall be as white as snow;</span></indent><span>
  though they be red like crimson,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>they shall be as wool.</span></indent>
  <verse>19</verse><span>If ye be willing and obedient,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>ye shall eat the good of the land;</span></indent>
  <verse>20</verse><span>but if ye refuse and rebel,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>ye shall be devoured with the sword;”</span></indent>

  Zion is corrupted
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>How is the faithful city</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>become a harlot!</span></indent><span>
  It was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>but now murderers.</span></indent>
  <verse>22</verse><span>Thy silver is become dross,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>thy wine mixed with water;</span></indent>
  <verse>23</verse><span>thy princes are rebellious,</span><break></break>

  everyone loveth gifts,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and followeth after rewards;</span></indent><span>
  they judge not the fatherless,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>Therefore saith the LORD,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the LORD of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel,</span></indent><span>
  “Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and avenge me of mine enemies.</span></indent>
  <verse>25</verse><span>And I will turn my hand upon thee;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin;</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>26</verse><span>and I will restore thy judges as at the first,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and thy counselors as at the beginning;</span></indent><span>
  afterward thou shalt be called the city of righteousness,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the faithful city.”</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>27</verse><span>Zion shall be redeemed with judgment,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and her converts with righteousness.</span></indent>
  <verse>28</verse><span>And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed.</span></indent>

  <verse>29</verse><span>For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.</span></indent>
  <verse>30</verse><span>For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and as a garden that hath no water.</span></indent>
  <verse>31</verse><span>And the strong shall be as tow,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the maker of it as a spark,</span></indent><span>
  and they shall both burn together,</span><break></break>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.</span><break></break>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>And it shall come to pass in the last days:</span><break></break><span>
  When the mountain of the LORD’s house shall be established</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>in the top of the mountains,</span></indent><span>
  and shall be exalted above the hills,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and all nations shall flow unto it.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>And many people shall go and say,</span><break></break><span>
  “Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD,</span><break></break>

  and he will teach us of his ways,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and we will walk in his paths.”</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  For out of Zion shall go forth the law,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem;</span></indent>
  <verse>4</verse><span>and he shall judge among the nations,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and shall rebuke many people;</span></indent><span>
  and they shall beat their swords into ploughshares,</span><break></break>

  nation shall not lift up sword against nation,</span><break></break>

  <verse>6</verse><span>Therefore, O LORD, thou hast forsaken thy people</span><break></break>

  <verse>10</verse><span>O ye wicked ones, enter into the rock, and hide ye in the dust;</span><break></break>

  <verse>1</verse><span>For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah</span></indent><span>
  the stay and the staff,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the whole staff of bread, and the whole stay of water,</span></indent>
  <verse>2</verse><span>the mighty man, and the man of war,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient,</span></indent>
  <verse>3</verse><span>the captain of fifty, and the honorable man,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the counselor, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator.</span></indent>
  <verse>4</verse><span>And I will give children unto them to be their princes,</span><break></break>

  The child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient,</span><break></break>

  <verse>6</verse><span>When a man shall take hold of his brother</span><break></break>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>For Jerusalem is ruined,</span><break></break>

  because their tongues and their doings have been against the LORD,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>to provoke the eyes of his glory.</span></indent>
  <verse>9</verse><span>The show of their countenance doth witness against them;</span><break></break>

  Woe unto their souls,</span><break></break>

 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>Say unto the righteous, that it is well with them;</span><break></break>

  <verse>13</verse><span>The LORD standeth up to plead,</span><break></break>

  <verse>14</verse><span>The LORD will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people,</span><break></break>

  <verse>15</verse><span>“What mean ye? Ye beat my people to pieces,</span><break></break>

  walking and mincing as they go,</span><break></break>

  <verse>17</verse><span>therefore the LORD will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of
  Zion,</span><break></break>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>In that day the LORD will take away the bravery of tinkling ornaments,

  the crisping pins,
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>the glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the veils.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>24</verse><span>And it shall come to pass, instead of sweet smell there shall be stink;</span><break></break>

  <indent><span>burning instead of beauty.</span></indent>

  remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even everyone that is

  Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>And the LORD will create upon every dwelling place of mount Zion, and

  <verse>1</verse><span>And then will I sing to my well-beloved</span><break></break>

  My well­beloved hath a vineyard</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>in a very fruitful hill;</span></indent>
  <verse>2</verse><span>And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and planted it with the choicest vine,</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  and built a tower in the midst of it,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and also made a winepress therein;</span></indent><span>

  <verse>3</verse><span>And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.</span></indent>

  <indent><span>that I have not done in it?</span></indent><span>
  Wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>it brought forth wild grapes.</span></indent>
  <verse>5</verse><span>And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up;</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and I will break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down;</span></indent>
  <verse>6</verse><span>and I will lay it waste;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>it shall not be pruned, nor digged;</span></indent><span>

 <chapter>6

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the LORD sitting upon a
  throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>Above it stood the seraphim; each one had six wings; with twain he
  covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he
  did fly.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And one cried unto another, and said, “Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of
  hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory.”
  </span><verse>4</verse><span>And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the
  house was filled with smoke.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>Then said I, “Woe is me! For I am undone; because I am a man of unclean
  lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for mine
  eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>Then flew one of the seraphim unto me, having a live coal in his hand,
  which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar;
  </span><verse>7</verse><span>and he laid it upon my mouth, and said, “Lo, this has touched thy lips;
  and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>Also I heard the voice of the LORD, saying, “Whom shall I send, and who
  will go for us?” Then said I, “Here am I; send me.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>And he said, “Go, and tell this people,</span><break></break><span>
  ‘Hear ye indeed, but they understood not;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and see ye indeed, but they perceived not.’</span></indent>
  <verse>10</verse><span>Make the heart of this people fat,</span><break></break>

 <chapter>7

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of
  Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son
  of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war against it,
  but could not prevail against it.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with
  Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the
  tress of the wood are moved with the wind.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>Then said the LORD unto Isaiah:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>
    Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou, and Shear-jashub thy son, at the end of
    the conduit of the upper pool, in the highway of the fuller’s field;
    </span><verse>4</verse><span>and say unto him, “Take heed, and be quiet; fear
    not, neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking
    firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of
    Remaliah.
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of
    Remaliah, have taken evil counsel against thee, saying,
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>‘Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let
    us make a breach therein for us, and set a king in the midst of it, yea,
    even the son of Tabeal.’”
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>7</verse><span>Thus saith the Lord GOD: It shall not stand, neither shall it come to
    pass.
    </span><verse>8</verse><span>For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin;
    and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken, that it be
    not a people.
    </span><verse>9</verse><span>And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is
    Remaliah’s son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be
    established.</span></block>

  <verse>10</verse><span>Moreover the LORD spake again unto Ahaz, saying:</span><quote>

  <verse>12</verse><span>But Ahaz said, “I will not ask, neither will I tempt the LORD.”

  Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid waste,</span><break></break>

  because in the night Kir of Moab is laid waste,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and brought to silence;</span></indent>
  <verse>2</verse><span>He is gone up to Bajith, and to Dibon, the high places, to weep;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>Moab shall howl over Nebo, and over Medeba.</span></indent><span>
  On all their heads shall be baldness,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and every beard cut off.</span></indent>
  <verse>3</verse><span>In their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>on the tops of their houses, and in their streets,</span></indent><span>
  everyone shall howl,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>weeping abundantly.</span></indent>
  <verse>4</verse><span>And Heshbon shall cry, and Elealeh;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>their voice shall be heard even unto Jahaz;</span></indent><span>
  therefore the armed soldiers of Moab shall cry out;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>his life shall be grievous unto him.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>My heart shall cry out for Moab;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>his fugitives shall flee unto Zoar,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>a heifer of three years old;</span></indent><span>
  for by the mounting up of Luhith with weeping shall they go it up;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>for in the way of Horonaim they shall raise up a cry of destruction.</span></indent>
  <verse>6</verse><span>For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate;</span><break></break>

  the grass faileth,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>there is no green thing.</span></indent>
  <verse>7</verse><span>Therefore the abundance they have gotten,</span><break></break>

  <indent><span>the howling thereof unto Eglaim, and the howling thereof unto Beer-elim.</span></indent>
  <verse>9</verse><span>For the waters of Dimon shall be full of blood;</span><break></break>

  <verse>3</verse><span>Take counsel,</span><break></break>

  <verse>13</verse><span>This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning Moab since that

  </span><verse>14</verse><span>But
  now the LORD hath spoken, saying, “Within three years, as the years of a

  breaking down the walls,</span><break></break>

  <verse>6</verse><span>And Elam bare the quiver with chariots of men and horsemen,</span><break></break>

  <verse>8</verse><span>And he discovered the covering of Judah,</span><break></break>

  <indent><span>and the houses have ye broken down to fortify the wall.</span></indent>
  <verse>11</verse><span>Ye made also a ditch between the two walls</span><break></break>

  <verse>12</verse><span>And in that day did the LORD God of hosts call to weeping, and to mourning,</span><break></break>

  <verse>13</verse><span>And behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen, and killing sheep,</span><break></break>

  <verse>14</verse><span>And it was revealed in mine ears by the LORD of hosts, “Surely this

  God of hosts.

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>Thus saith the LORD God of hosts, “Go, get thee unto this treasurer,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>even unto Shebna, which is over the house, and say,</span></indent>
  <verse>16</verse><span>‘What hast thou here, and whom hast thou here,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>that thou hast hewed thee out a sepulcher here,</span></indent><span>

  <verse>17</verse><span>Behold, the LORD will carry thee away with a mighty captivity,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and will surely cover thee.</span></indent>
  <verse>18</verse><span>He will surely violently turn and toss thee like a ball into a large country;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>there shalt thou die,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and there the chariots of thy glory shall be the shame of thy lord’s house.</span></indent>
  <verse>19</verse><span>And I will drive thee from thy station,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and from thy state shall he pull thee down.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my servant
  Eliakim the son of Hilkiah;
  </span><verse>21</verse><span>and I will clothe him with thy robe, and strengthen him with thy
  girdle, and I will commit thy government into his hand; and he shall
  be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of
  Judah.
  </span><verse>22</verse><span>And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder; so
  he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none
  shall open.
  </span><verse>23</verse><span>And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place; and he shall be
  for a glorious throne to his father’s house.
  </span><verse>24</verse><span>And they shall hang upon him all the glory
  of his father’s house, the offspring and the issue, all vessels of
  small quantity, from the vessels of cups, even to all the vessels of

  <verse>25</verse><span>“In that day,” saith the LORD of hosts, “shall the nail that is

  <indent><span>he stayeth his rough wind in the day of the east wind.</span></indent>
  <verse>9</verse><span>By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and this is all the fruit to take away his sin;</span></indent>
  <indent><span>when he maketh all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>the groves and images shall not stand up.</span></indent>
  <verse>10</verse><span>Yet the defensed city shall be desolate,</span><break></break>

  <verse>11</verse><span>When the boughs thereof are withered, they shall be broken off;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the women come, and set them on fire;</span></indent><span>

  <indent><span>he that believeth shall not make haste.</span></indent>

  <verse>19</verse><span>From the time that it goeth forth it shall take you;</span><break></break>

  <indent><span>doth he not cast abroad the fitches, and scatter the cummin,</span></indent><span>
  and cast in the principal wheat</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the appointed barley and the rye in their place?</span></indent>
  <verse>26</verse><span>For his God doth instruct him to discretion,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and doth teach him.</span></indent>
  <verse>27</verse><span>For the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>neither is a cartwheel turned about upon the cummin;</span></indent><span>

  <indent><span>and the cummin with a rod.</span></indent>
  <verse>28</verse><span>Bread corn is bruised;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>because he will not ever be threshing it,</span></indent><span>

  Add ye year to year;</span><break></break>

  <break></break>
  <indent><span>“It shall be unto Ariel;</span></indent>
  <verse>3</verse><span>that I the LORD will camp against her round about,</span><break></break>

  A book shall come forth
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <dunder><span>
   And it shall come to pass, that the Lord God shall bring forth unto you
   the words of a book; and they shall be the words of
   them which have slumbered. And behold, the book shall be sealed; and in the book shall be a revelation from God, from the
   beginning of the world to the ending thereof.
   Wherefore because of the things which are sealed up, the
   things which are sealed shall not be delivered in the day of the
   wickedness and abominations of the people.
   Wherefore, the book shall be kept from them.</span></dunder>
 </block>

 <block>
  <dunder><span>
   But the book shall be delivered unto a man, and he shall deliver the words
   of the book, which are the words of those who have
   slumbered in the dust; and he shall deliver these words unto another, but the words that are sealed he shall not deliver,
   neither shall he deliver the book. For the book
   shall be sealed by the power of God, and the revelation which was sealed shall be kept in the book until the own due time of the
   Lord, that they may come forth; for behold, they
   reveal all things from the foundation of the world unto the end thereof. And the day cometh, that the words of the book which
   were sealed shall be read upon the housetops; and
   they shall be read by the power of Christ; and all things shall be revealed unto the children of men which ever have been among the
   children of men, and which ever will be, even unto
   the end of the earth.</span></dunder>
 </block>

 <block>
  <dunder><span>
   Wherefore, at that day when the book shall be delivered unto the man of
   whom I have spoken, the book shall be hid from the
   eyes of the world, that the eyes of none shall behold it, save it be that three witnesses shall behold it by the power
   of God, besides him to whom the book shall be
   delivered; and they shall testify to the truth of the book and the things therein. And there is none other which shall view it, save it
   be a few according to the will of God, to bear
   testimony of his word unto the children of men; for the Lord God hath said, that the words of the faithful should speak as it were
   from the dead.
  </span></dunder>
 </block>

 <block>
  <dunder><span>
   Wherefore, the Lord God will proceed to bring forth the words of the book;
   and in the mouth of as many witnesses as seemeth
   him good will he establish his word; and woe be unto him that rejecteth the word of God.
  </span></dunder>
 </block>

 <block>
  <dunder><span>
   But, behold, it shall come to pass, that the Lord God shall say unto him
   to whom he shall deliver the book, “Take these
   words which are not sealed and deliver them to another,” that he may show them unto the learned, saying, “Read this, I pray thee.”
   And the learned shall say, “Bring hither the book
   and I will read them.” And now because of the glory of the world, and to get gain will they say this, and not for the glory of
   God. And the man shall say, “I cannot bring the
   book for it is sealed.” Then shall the learned say, “I cannot read it.”
  </span></dunder>
 </block>

 <block>
  <dunder><span>
   Wherefore it shall come to pass, that the Lord God will deliver again the
   book and the words thereof to him that is not
   learned; and the man that is not learned shall say, “I am not learned.” Then shall the Lord God say unto him:
   </span><quote><span>
    The learned shall not read them, for they have rejected them, and I am
    able to do mine own work; wherefore thou shalt read
    the words which I shall give unto thee. Touch not
    the things which are sealed, for I will bring them forth in mine own
    due time; for I will show unto the children of men
    that I am able to do mine own work. Wherefore, when
    thou hast read the words which I have commanded thee, and obtained the witnesses which I have promised unto thee, then shalt thou
    seal up the book again, and hide it up unto me,
    that I may preserve the words which thou hast not read until I shall see fit in mine own wisdom to reveal all
    things unto the children of men. For behold, I am God; and I am a God of miracles; and I will show
    unto the world that I am the same yesterday, today,
    and forever; and I work not among the children of
    men, save it be according to their faith.</span></quote>
  </dunder>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>And again it shall come to pass, that the LORD

  Forasmuch as this people draw near unto me with their mouth,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and with their lips do honor me,</span></indent><span>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>therefore I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>yea, a marvelous work and a wonder;</span></indent><span>

  <indent>
   <verse>16</verse><span>And they also say, “Surely, your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as</span></indent>
  <indent><span>the potter’s clay.”</span></indent>
  <dunder><span>But behold, I will show unto them, saith the Lord of hosts, that I know all their works.</span></dunder>
  <break></break>
  <indent><span>For, shall the work say of him that made it, “He made me not?”</span></indent>
  <indent><span>Or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it, “He had no understanding?”</span></indent>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><dunder><span>But behold, saith the Lord of hosts, I will show unto the children of men,</span></dunder><span>

  <indent><span>and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest.</span></indent>

  <verse>18</verse><span>And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness;</span></indent>
  <verse>19</verse><span>and the meek also shall increase, and their joy shall be in the LORD;</span><break></break>

  <verse>1</verse><span>Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, the
  Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the defensed cities of
  Judah, and took them.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto
  king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the
  upper pool in the highway of the fuller’s field.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>Then
  came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah’s son, which was over the house, and
  Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph’s son, the recorder.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>And Rabshakeh said unto them:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>
    Say ye now to Hezekiah: Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria,
    “What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?
    </span><verse>5</verse><span>I say, thy words are but vain when thou sayest,
    ‘I have counsel and strength for war.’ Now, on whom dost thou trust that
    thou rebellest against me?
    </span><verse>6</verse><span>Lo, thou trustest in
    the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go
    into his hand, and pierce it; so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that
    trust in him.
    </span><verse>7</verse><span>But if thou say to me, ‘We trust
    in the LORD our God;’ is it not he, whose high places and whose altars
    Hezekiah hath taken away, and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, ‘Ye shall
    worship before this altar?’”
   </span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>8</verse><span>Now therefore give pledges, I pray thee, to my master the king of
    Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on
    thy part to set riders upon them.
    </span><verse>9</verse><span>How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my
    master’s servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for
    horsemen?
    </span><verse>10</verse><span>And am I now come up without the LORD against this land to destroy it?
    The LORD said unto me, ‘Go up against this land, and destroy it.’</span></block>

  </quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, “Speak, I pray
  thee, unto thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it;
  and speak not to us in the Jews’ language, in the ears of the people
  that are on the wall.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>But Rabshakeh said, “Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee
  to speak these words? Hath he not sent me to the men that sit upon the
  wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with
  you?”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews’
  language, and said:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of
   Assyria.
    </span><verse>14</verse><span>Thus saith the king, “Let not Hezekiah deceive you; for he shall not be
    able to deliver you.
    </span><verse>15</verse><span>Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, ‘The LORD will
    surely deliver us; this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the
    king of Assyria.’”</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>16</verse><span>Hearken not to Hezekiah; for thus saith the king of Assyria, “Make an
    agreement with me by a present, and come out to me; and eat ye everyone
    of his vine, and everyone of his fig tree, and drink ye everyone the
    waters of his own cistern;
    </span><verse>17</verse><span>until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of
    corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.”</span></block>

   <block>
    <verse>18</verse><span>Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, “The LORD will deliver us.”
    Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand
    of the king of Assyria?
    </span><verse>19</verse><span>Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of
    Sepharvaim? And have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?
    </span><verse>20</verse><span>Who are they among all the gods of these lands, that have delivered
    their land out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of
    my hand?</span></block>

  </quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>But they held their peace, and answered him not a word; for the king’s
  commandment was, saying, “Answer him not.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>Then came Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, that was over the household, and
  Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, to Hezekiah
  with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.
 </span></block>

 <heading><span>Deliverance from Assyria foretold
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>37
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his
  clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of
  the LORD.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe,
  and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, unto Isaiah the
  prophet the son of Amoz.
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>And they said unto him:</span><quote><span>
   Thus said Hezekiah, “This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of
   blasphemy; for the children are come to the birth, and there is not
   strength to bring forth.
   </span><verse>4</verse><span>It may be the LORD thy
   God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master
   hath sent to reproach the living God, and will reprove the words which the
   LORD thy God hath heard; wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that
   is left.”
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
  </span><verse>6</verse><span>And Isaiah said unto them:</span><quote><span>
   Thus shall ye say unto your master, “Thus saith the LORD: Be not afraid of
   the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of
   Assyria have blasphemed me.
   </span><verse>7</verse><span>Behold, I will send
   a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumor, and return to his own land;
   and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.”
  </span></quote>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against
  Libnah; for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.
  </span><verse>9</verse><span>And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, “He is come
  forth to make war with thee.” And when he heard it, he sent messengers
  to Hezekiah, saying:</span><quote>
   <verse>10</verse><span>Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, “Let not thy
   God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying, ‘Jerusalem shall not
   be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.’
   </span><verse>11</verse><span>Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all
   lands by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered?
   </span><verse>12</verse><span>Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have
   destroyed, as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden
   which were in Telassar?
   </span><verse>13</verse><span>Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad? And the king of the
   city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?”</span></quote>
 </block>

 <heading><span>
  Hezekiah’s prayer
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and
  read it; and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the LORD, and spread it
  before the LORD.
  </span><verse>15</verse><span>And Hezekiah prayed unto the LORD, saying:</span><quote>
   <verse>16</verse><span>O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, that dwellest between the cherubim,
   thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth;
   thou hast made heaven and earth.
   </span><verse>17</verse><span>Incline thine ear, O LORD, and hear; open thine eyes, O LORD, and see;
   and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which he hath sent to reproach
   the living God.
   </span><verse>18</verse><span>Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations,
   and their countries,
   </span><verse>19</verse><span>and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no gods, but the
   work of men’s hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them.
   </span><verse>20</verse><span>Now therefore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all the
   kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the LORD, even thou
   only.</span></quote>

  The LORD’s response
 </span></heading>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying:
  </span><quote>
   <block><span>
    Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, whereas thou hast prayed to me against
    Sennacherib king of Assyria;
    </span><verse>22</verse><span>this is the word
    which the LORD hath spoken concerning him:
   </span></block>

   <block><span>
    “The virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath despised thee, and laughed thee to scorn;</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.</span></indent>
    <verse>23</verse><span>Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed?</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>And against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high?</span></indent>
    <indent><span>Even against the Holy One of Israel.</span></indent>
    <verse>24</verse><span>By thy servants hast thou reproached the LORD, and hast said,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>“By the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains,</span></indent>
    <indent><span>to the sides of Lebanon;</span></indent><span>
    and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and the choice fir trees thereof;</span></indent><span>
    and I will enter into the height of his border,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and the forest of his Carmel.</span></indent>
    <verse>25</verse><span>I have digged, and drunk water;</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places.”</span></indent>
   </block>

   <block>
    <verse>26</verse><span>“Hast thou not heard long ago, how I have done it;</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and of ancient times, that I have formed it?</span></indent><span>
    Now have I brought to pass,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>that thou shouldest be to lay waste defensed cities into ruinous heaps.</span></indent>
    <verse>27</verse><span>Therefore their inhabitants were of small power,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>they were dismayed and confounded;</span></indent><span>
    they were as the grass of the field,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and as the green herb,</span></indent><span>
    as the grass on the housetops,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and as corn blasted before it be grown up.”</span></indent>
   </block>

   <block>
    <verse>28</verse><span>“But I know thy abode, and thy going out,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and thy coming in, and thy rage against me.</span></indent>
    <verse>29</verse><span>Because thy rage against me,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and thy tumult is come up into mine ears,</span></indent><span>
    therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips,</span><break></break>

   <block>
    <verse>30</verse><span>“And this shall be a sign unto thee:</span><break></break><span>
    Ye shall eat this year such as groweth of itself;</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and the second year that which springeth of the same;</span></indent><span>
    and in the third year sow ye, and reap,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.</span></indent>
    <verse>31</verse><span>And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward,</span><break></break>

    <indent><span>the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this.”</span></indent>
   </block>

   <block>
    <verse>33</verse><span>Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria,</span><break></break><span>

    <indent><span>nor shoot an arrow there,</span></indent><span>
    nor come before it with shields,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>nor cast a bank against it.</span></indent>
    <verse>34</verse><span>By the way that he came, by the same shall he return,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>and shall not come into this city, saith the LORD.</span></indent>

  Hezekiah’s illness
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>38
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet the
  son of Amoz came unto him, and said unto him, “Thus saith the LORD: Set
  thine house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed unto the
  LORD,
  </span><verse>3</verse><span>and said, “Remember now, O Lord, I beseech thee, how I have walked
  before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which
  is good in thy sight.” And Hezekiah wept sore.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah, saying:</span><quote>
   <verse>5</verse><span>Go, and say to Hezekiah, “Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy
   father: I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears; behold, I will
   add unto thy days fifteen years.
   </span><verse>6</verse><span>And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of
   Assyria; and I will defend this city.
   </span><verse>7</verse><span>And this shall be a sign unto thee from the LORD, that the LORD will do
   this thing that he hath spoken;
   </span><verse>8</verse><span>behold, I will bring again the shadow of the degrees, which is gone
   down in the sundial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward.”</span></quote>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  So the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it was gone down.

  <verse>9</verse><span>The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and was
  recovered of his sickness:</span><quote>
   <block>
    <verse>10</verse><span>I said in the cutting off of my days,</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>I shall go to the gates of the grave;</span></indent>
    <indent><span>I am deprived of the residue of my years.</span></indent>
    <verse>11</verse><span>I said, “I shall not see the LORD, even the LORD, in the land of the living;</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world.</span></indent>
    <verse>12</verse><span>Mine age is departed,</span><break></break>

    <indent><span>from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.</span></indent>
    <verse>13</verse><span>I reckoned till morning, that, as a lion, so will he break all my bones;</span><break></break>
    <indent><span>from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.</span></indent>

  Envoys from Babylon

 <chapter>39
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>At that time Merodach-baladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon,
  sent letters and a present to Hezekiah; for he had heard that he had
  been sick, and was recovered.
  </span><verse>2</verse><span>And Hezekiah was glad of them, and showed them the house of his
  precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the
  precious ointment, and all the house of his armor, and all that was
  found in his treasures; there was nothing in his house, nor in all his
  dominion, that Hezekiah showed him not.
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him,
  “What said these men? And from whence came they unto thee?” And Hezekiah
  said, “They are come from a far country unto me, even from
  Babylon.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Then said he, “What have they seen in thine house?” And Hezekiah
  answered, “All that is in mine house have they seen; there is nothing
  among my treasures that I have not showed them.”
 </span></block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah:</span><quote><span>
   Hear the word of the LORD of hosts;
   </span><verse>6</verse><span>behold, the
   days come, that all that is in thine house, and that which thy fathers
   have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried to Babylon; nothing
   shall be left, saith the LORD.

   that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away;
   and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.

  <verse>15</verse><span>For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>whose name is Holy;</span></indent><span>
  “I dwell in the high and holy place,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit,</span></indent><span>
  to revive the spirit of the humble,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.</span></indent>
  <verse>16</verse><span>For I will not contend forever,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>neither will I be always wroth;</span></indent><span>
  for the spirit should fail before me,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the souls which I have made.</span></indent>
  <verse>17</verse><span>For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>I hid me and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart.</span></indent>
  <verse>18</verse><span>I have seen his ways, and will heal him;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>I will lead him also, and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners.</span></indent>
  <indent><verse>19</verse><span>I create the fruit of the lips;</span></indent><span>
  Peace, peace to him that is far off,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and to him that is near”, saith the LORD, “and I will heal him.”</span></indent>

  <verse>1</verse><span>Cry aloud, spare not,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>lift up thy voice like a trumpet,</span></indent><span>
  and show my people their transgression,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the house of Jacob their sins.</span></indent>
  <verse>2</verse><span>Yet they seek me daily,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and delight to know my ways,</span></indent><span>
  as a nation that did righteousness,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and forsook not the ordinance of their God;</span></indent><span>
  they ask of me the ordinances of justice;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>they take delight in approaching to God.</span></indent>
  <verse>3</verse><span>“Wherefore have we fasted,” say they,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>“and thou seest not?</span></indent><span>
  Wherefore have we afflicted our soul,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and thou takest no knowledge?”</span></indent>

 <block><span>
  Behold, in the day of your fast ye find pleasure,</span><break></break>

  <verse>4</verse><span>Behold, ye fast for strife and debate,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and to smite with the fist of wickedness;</span></indent><span>
  ye shall not fast as ye do this day,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>to make your voice to be heard on high.</span></indent>
  <verse>5</verse><span>Is it such a fast that I have chosen?</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>A day for a man to afflict his soul?</span></indent><span>
  Is it to bow down his head as a bulrush,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him?</span></indent><span>
  Wilt thou call this a fast,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and an acceptable day to the LORD?</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>Is not this the fast that I have chosen?</span><break></break><span>
  To loose the bands of wickedness,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>to undo the heavy burdens,</span></indent><span>
  and to let the oppressed go free,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and that ye break every yoke?</span></indent>
  <verse>7</verse><span>Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house?</span></indent><span>
  When thou seest the naked, that thou cover him;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?</span></indent>
  <verse>8</verse><span>Then shall thy light break forth as the morning,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and thine health shall spring forth speedily;</span></indent><span>
  and thy righteousness shall go before thee;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the glory of the LORD shall be thy rearward.</span></indent>
  <verse>9</verse><span>Then shalt thou call, and the LORD shall answer;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>thou shalt cry, and he shall say, “Here I am.”</span></indent>

  If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the putting forth of the finger, and speaking vanity;</span></indent>
  <verse>10</verse><span>and if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and satisfy the afflicted soul;</span></indent><span>
  then shall thy light rise in obscurity,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and thy darkness be as the noonday;</span></indent>
  <verse>11</verse><span>and the LORD shall guide thee continually,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and satisfy thy soul in drought,</span></indent><span>
  and make fat thy bones;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and thou shalt be like a watered garden,</span></indent><span>
  and like a spring of water,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>whose waters fail not.</span></indent>
  <verse>12</verse><span>And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations;</span></indent><span>

  <indent><span>the holy of the LORD, honorable;</span></indent><span>

  <indent><span>not doing thine own ways,</span></indent><span>

  Sin separates us from God

 <chapter>59

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>Behold, the LORD’s hand is not shortened, that it cannot save;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear;</span></indent>
  <verse>2</verse><span>But your iniquities have separated between you and your God,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.</span></indent>
  <verse>3</verse><span>For your hands are defiled with blood,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and your fingers with iniquity;</span></indent><span>
  your lips have spoken lies,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>your tongue hath muttered perverseness.</span></indent>
  <verse>4</verse><span>None calleth for justice,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>nor any pleadeth for truth;</span></indent><span>
  they trust in vanity,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and speak lies;</span></indent><span>
  they conceive mischief,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and bring forth iniquity.</span></indent>
  <verse>5</verse><span>They hatch cockatrice eggs,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and weave the spider’s web;</span></indent><span>
  he that eateth of their eggs dieth,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper.</span></indent>
  <verse>6</verse><span>Their webs shall not become garments,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>neither shall they cover themselves with their works;</span></indent><span>
  their works are works of iniquity,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the act of violence is in their hands.</span></indent>
  <verse>7</verse><span>Their feet run to evil,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and they make haste to shed innocent blood;</span></indent><span>
  their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>wasting and destruction are in their paths.</span></indent>
  <verse>8</verse><span>The way of peace they know not;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and there is no judgment in their goings;</span></indent><span>
  they have made them crooked paths;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>whosoever goeth therein shall not know peace.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>Therefore is judgment far from us,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>neither doth justice overtake us;</span></indent><span>
  we wait for light, but behold obscurity;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>for brightness, but we walk in darkness.</span></indent>
  <verse>10</verse><span>We grope for the wall like the blind,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and we grope as if we had no eyes;</span></indent><span>
  we stumble at noonday as in the night;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>we are in desolate places as dead men.</span></indent>
  <verse>11</verse><span>We roar all like bears, and mourn sore like doves;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>we look for judgment, but there is none;</span></indent>
  <indent><span>for salvation, but it is far off from us.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>For our transgressions are multiplied before thee,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and our sins testify against us;</span></indent><span>
  for our transgressions are with us;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and as for our iniquities, we know them;</span></indent>
  <verse>13</verse><span>In transgressing and lying against the LORD,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and departing away from our God,</span></indent><span>
  speaking oppression and revolt,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.</span></indent>
  <verse>14</verse><span>And judgment is turned away backward,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and justice standeth afar off;</span></indent><span>
  for truth is fallen in the street,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and equity cannot enter.</span></indent>
  <verse>15</verse><span>Yea, truth faileth;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  And the LORD saw it,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and it displeased him that there was no judgment.</span></indent>
  <verse>16</verse><span>And he saw that there was no man,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and wondered that there was no intercessor;</span></indent><span>
  therefore his arm brought salvation unto him;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and his righteousness, it sustained him.</span></indent>
  <verse>17</verse><span>For he put on righteousness as a breastplate,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and a helmet of salvation upon his head;</span></indent><span>
  and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and was clad with zeal as a cloak.</span></indent>
  <verse>18</verse><span>According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>fury to his adversaries, recompense to his enemies;</span></indent>
  <indent><span>to the islands he will repay recompense.</span></indent>
  <verse>19</verse><span>So shall they fear the name of the LORD from the west,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and his glory from the rising of the sun.</span></indent><span>
  When the enemy shall come in like a flood,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the Spirit of the LORD shall lift up a standard against him.</span></indent>
