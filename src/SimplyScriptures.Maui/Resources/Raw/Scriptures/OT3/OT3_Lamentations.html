  Jerusalem is desolate

 <chapter>1

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>How doth the city sit solitary,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>that was full of people!</span></indent><span>
  How is she become as a widow!</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>She that was great among the nations,</span></indent><span>
  and princess among the provinces,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>how is she become tributary!</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>She weepeth sore in the night,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and her tears are on her cheeks;</span></indent><span>
  among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>all her friends have dealt treacherously with her,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>they are become her enemies.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and because of great servitude;</span></indent><span>
  she dwelleth among the heathen,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>she findeth no rest;</span></indent><span>
  all her persecutors overtook her between the straits.</span><break></break>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>The ways of Zion do mourn,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>because none come to the solemn feasts;</span></indent><span>
  all her gates are desolate;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>her priests sigh,</span></indent><span>
  her virgins are afflicted,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and she is in bitterness.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>Her adversaries are the chief,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>her enemies prosper;</span></indent><span>
  for the LORD hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>her children are gone into captivity before the enemy.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>her princes are become like harts that find no pasture,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and they are gone without strength before the pursuer.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old,</span></indent><span>
  when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none did help her;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the adversaries saw her, and did mock at her Sabbaths.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>Jerusalem hath grievously sinned;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>therefore she is removed;</span></indent><span>
  all that honored her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>Her filthiness is in her skirts;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>she remembereth not her last end;</span></indent><span>
  therefore she came down wonderfully;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>she had no comforter.</span></indent><span>
  O Lord, behold my affliction;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>for the enemy hath magnified himself.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>for she hath seen that the heathen entered into her sanctuary,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>whom thou didst command that they should not enter into thy congregation.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>All her people sigh, they seek bread;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>they have given their pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul;</span></indent><span>
  see, O Lord, and consider;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>for I am become vile.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by?</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>Behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto me,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>wherewith the LORD hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>From above hath he sent fire into my bones,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and it prevaileth against them;</span></indent><span>
  he hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me back;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he hath made me desolate and faint all the day.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>they are wreathed, and come up upon my neck;</span></indent><span>
  he hath made my strength to fall,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the LORD hath delivered me into their hands,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>from whom I am not able to rise up.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>The LORD hath trodden under foot all my mighty men in the midst of me;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men;</span></indent><span>
  the LORD hath trodden the virgin,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the daughter of Judah, as in a winepress.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>For these things I weep;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water,</span></indent><span>
  because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>my children are desolate, because the enemy prevailed.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>Zion spreadeth forth her hands,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and there is none to comfort her;</span></indent><span>
  the LORD hath commanded concerning Jacob,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>that his adversaries should be round about him;</span></indent><span>
  Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them.</span><break></break>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>The LORD is righteous;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>for I have rebelled against his commandments;</span></indent><span>
  hear, I pray you, all people,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and behold my sorrow;</span></indent><span>
  my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.</span><break></break>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>I called for my lovers, but they deceived me;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>my priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>while they sought their meat to relieve their souls.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>Behold, O Lord; for I am in distress;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>my bowels are troubled;</span></indent><span>
  mine heart is turned within me;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>for I have grievously rebelled;</span></indent><span>
  abroad the sword bereaveth,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>at home there is as death.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>They have heard that I sigh;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>there is none to comfort me;</span></indent><span>
  all mine enemies have heard of my trouble;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>they are glad that thou hast done it;</span></indent><span>
  thou wilt bring the day that thou hast called,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and they shall be like unto me.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>Let all their wickedness come before thee;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and do unto them, as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions;</span></indent><span>
  for my sighs are many,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and my heart is faint.</span></indent>

  God’s anger over Jerusalem
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>2
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>How hath the LORD covered the daughter of Zion</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>with a cloud in his anger,</span></indent><span>
  and cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger!</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>The LORD hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and hath not pitied;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he hath thrown down in his wrath the strongholds of the daughter of Judah;</span></indent><span>
  he hath brought them down to the ground;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he hath polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>He hath cut off in his fierce anger all the horn of Israel;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy,</span></indent><span>
  and he burned against Jacob like a flaming fire,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>which devoureth round about.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>He hath bent his bow like an enemy;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he stood with his right hand as an adversary,</span></indent><span>
  and slew all that were pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he poured out his fury like fire.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>The LORD was as an enemy;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he hath swallowed up Israel,</span></indent><span>
  he hath swallowed up all her palaces;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he hath destroyed his strongholds,</span></indent><span>
  and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.</span><break></break>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were of a garden;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he hath destroyed his places of the assembly;</span></indent><span>
  the LORD hath caused the solemn feasts and Sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>The LORD hath cast off his altar,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he hath abhorred his sanctuary,</span></indent><span>
  he hath given up into the hand of the enemy</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the walls of her palaces;</span></indent><span>
  they have made a noise in the house of the LORD,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>as in the day of a solemn feast.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>The LORD hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he hath stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying;</span></indent><span>
  therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>they languished together.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>Her gates are sunk into the ground;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he hath destroyed and broken her bars;</span></indent><span>
  her king and her princes are among the Gentiles;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the law is no more;</span></indent><span>
  her prophets also find no vision from the LORD.</span><break></break>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, and keep silence;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>they have cast up dust upon their heads;</span></indent><span>
  they have girded themselves with sackcloth;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>Mine eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>my liver is poured upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people;</span></indent><span>
  because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city.</span><break></break>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>They say to their mothers,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>“Where is corn and wine?”</span></indent><span>
  When they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>when their soul was poured out into their mothers’ bosom.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>What thing shall I take to witness for thee?</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>What thing shall I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem?</span></indent><span>
  What shall I equal to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion?</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>For thy breach is great like the sea; who can heal thee?</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and they have not discovered thine iniquity, to turn away thy captivity;</span></indent>
  <indent><span>but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>All that pass by clap their hands at thee;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>they hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem,</span></indent><span>
  saying, “Is this the city that men call the perfection of beauty,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the joy of the whole earth?”</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>All thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>they hiss and gnash the teeth;</span></indent><span>
  they say, “We have swallowed her up; certainly this is the day that we looked for;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>we have found, we have seen it.”</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>The LORD hath done that which he had devised;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he hath fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old;</span></indent><span>
  he hath thrown down, and hath not pitied;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and he hath caused thine enemy to rejoice over thee,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>he hath set up the horn of thine adversaries.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>Their heart cried unto the LORD, O wall of the daughter of Zion,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>let tears run down like a river day and night;</span></indent><span>
  give thyself no rest;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>let not the apple of thine eye cease.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>Arise, cry out in the night;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>in the beginning of the watches pour out thine heart</span></indent><span>
  like water before the face of the LORD;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children,</span></indent><span>
  that faint for hunger in the top of every street.</span><break></break>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>Behold, O Lord, and consider to whom thou hast done this.</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>Shall the women eat their fruit, and children of a span long?</span></indent>
  <indent><span>Shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the LORD?</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword;</span></indent><span>
  thou hast slain them in the day of thine anger;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>thou hast killed, and not pitied.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>so that in the day of the LORD’s anger none escaped nor remained;</span></indent><span>
  those that I have swaddled and brought up</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>hath mine enemy consumed.</span></indent>

  Jeremiah’s afflictions
 </span></heading>

 <chapter>3
 </chapter>

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>I am the man that hath seen affliction</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>by the rod of his wrath.</span></indent>
  <verse>2</verse><span>He hath led me,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and brought me into darkness, but not into light.</span></indent>
  <verse>3</verse><span>Surely against me is he turned;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he turneth his hand against me all the day.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>My flesh and my skin hath he made old;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he hath broken my bones.</span></indent>
  <verse>5</verse><span>He hath builded against me,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and compassed me with gall and travail.</span></indent>
  <verse>6</verse><span>He hath set me in dark places,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>as they that be dead of old.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he hath made my chain heavy.</span></indent>
  <verse>8</verse><span>Also when I cry and shout,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he shutteth out my prayer.</span></indent>
  <verse>9</verse><span>He hath enclosed my ways with hewn stone;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he hath made my paths crooked.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>He was unto me as a bear lying in wait,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and as a lion in secret places.</span></indent>
  <verse>11</verse><span>He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he hath made me desolate.</span></indent>
  <verse>12</verse><span>He hath bent his bow,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and set me as a mark for the arrow.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>He hath caused the arrows of his quiver</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>to enter into my reins.</span></indent>
  <verse>14</verse><span>I was a derision to all my people;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and their song all the day.</span></indent>
  <verse>15</verse><span>He hath filled me with bitterness,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he hath made me drunken with wormwood.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he hath covered me with ashes.</span></indent>
  <verse>17</verse><span>And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>I forgat prosperity.</span></indent>
  <verse>18</verse><span>And I said, “My strength and my hope</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>is perished from the LORD;”</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>Remembering mine affliction and my misery,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the wormwood and the gall.</span></indent>
  <verse>20</verse><span>My soul hath them still in remembrance,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and is humbled in me.</span></indent>
  <verse>21</verse><span>This I recall to my mind,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>therefore have I hope.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>It is of the LORD’s mercies that we are not consumed,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>because his compassions fail not.</span></indent>
  <verse>23</verse><span>They are new every morning;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>great is thy faithfulness.</span></indent>
  <verse>24</verse><span>The LORD is my portion, saith my soul;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>therefore will I hope in him.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>25</verse><span>The LORD is good unto them that wait for him,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>to the soul that seeketh him.</span></indent>
  <verse>26</verse><span>It is good that a man should both hope</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD.</span></indent>
  <verse>27</verse><span>It is good for a man that he bear the yoke</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>in his youth.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>28</verse><span>He sitteth alone and keepeth silence,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>because he hath borne it upon him.</span></indent>
  <verse>29</verse><span>He putteth his mouth in the dust;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>if so be there may be hope.</span></indent>
  <verse>30</verse><span>He giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he is filled full with reproach.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>31</verse><span>For the LORD will not cast off forever;</span><break></break>
  <verse>32</verse><span>But though he cause grief,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies.</span></indent>
  <verse>33</verse><span>For he doth not afflict willingly,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>nor grieve the children of men.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>34</verse><span>To crush under his feet</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>all the prisoners of the earth,</span></indent>
  <verse>35</verse><span>To turn aside the right of a man</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>before the face of the Most High,</span></indent>
  <verse>36</verse><span>To subvert a man in his cause,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the LORD approveth not.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>37</verse><span>Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>when the LORD commandeth it not?</span></indent>
  <verse>38</verse><span>Out of the mouth of the Most High</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>proceedeth not evil and good?</span></indent>
  <verse>39</verse><span>Wherefore doth a living man complain,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>a man for the punishment of his sins?</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>40</verse><span>Let us search and try our ways,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and turn again to the LORD.</span></indent>
  <verse>41</verse><span>Let us lift up our heart with our hands</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>unto God in the heavens.</span></indent>
  <verse>42</verse><span>We have transgressed and have rebelled;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>thou hast not pardoned.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>43</verse><span>Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied.</span></indent>
  <verse>44</verse><span>Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>that our prayer should not pass through.</span></indent>
  <verse>45</verse><span>Thou hast made us as the offscouring</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and refuse in the midst of the people.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>46</verse><span>All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.</span><break></break>
  <verse>47</verse><span>Fear and a snare is come upon us,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>desolation and destruction.</span></indent>
  <verse>48</verse><span>Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>for the destruction of the daughter of my people.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>49</verse><span>Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>without any intermissions,</span></indent>
  <verse>50</verse><span>Till the LORD look down,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and behold from heaven.</span></indent>
  <verse>51</verse><span>Mine eye affecteth mine heart,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>because of all the daughters of my city.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>52</verse><span>Mine enemies chased me sore,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>like a bird, without cause.</span></indent>
  <verse>53</verse><span>They have cut off my life in the dungeon,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and cast a stone upon me.</span></indent>
  <verse>54</verse><span>Waters flowed over mine head;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>then I said, “I am cut off.”</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>55</verse><span>I called upon thy name, O LORD,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>out of the low dungeon.</span></indent>
  <verse>56</verse><span>Thou hast heard my voice;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.</span></indent>
  <verse>57</verse><span>Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>thou saidst, “Fear not.”</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>58</verse><span>O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>thou hast redeemed my life.</span></indent>
  <verse>59</verse><span>O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong;</span><break></break>

  <verse>60</verse><span>Thou hast seen all their vengeance</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and all their imaginations against me.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>61</verse><span>Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and all their imaginations against me;</span></indent>
  <verse>62</verse><span>The lips of those that rose up against me,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and their device against me all the day.</span></indent>
  <verse>63</verse><span>Behold their sitting down, and their rising up;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>I am their music.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>64</verse><span>Render unto them a recompense, O LORD,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>according to the work of their hands.</span></indent>
  <verse>65</verse><span>Give them sorrow of heart,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>thy curse unto them.</span></indent>
  <verse>66</verse><span>Persecute and destroy them in anger</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>from under the heavens of the LORD.</span></indent>

  The distress of Zion

 <chapter>4

 <block>
  <verse>1</verse><span>How is the gold become dim!</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>How is the most fine gold changed!</span></indent><span>
  The stones of the sanctuary are poured out</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>in the top of every street.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>2</verse><span>The precious sons of Zion,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>comparable to fine gold,</span></indent><span>
  how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the work of the hands of the potter!</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>3</verse><span>Even the sea monsters draw out the breast,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>they give suck to their young ones;</span></indent><span>
  the daughter of my people is become cruel,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>like the ostriches in the wilderness.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>4</verse><span>The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the young children ask bread, and no man breaketh it unto them.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>5</verse><span>They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>6</verse><span>For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom,</span></indent><span>
  that was overthrown as in a moment,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and no hands stayed on her.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>Her Nazarites were purer than snow,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>they were whiter than milk,</span></indent><span>
  they were more ruddy in body than rubies,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>their polishing was of sapphire;</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>8</verse><span>Their visage is blacker than a coal;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>they are not known in the streets;</span></indent><span>
  their skin cleaveth to their bones;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>it is withered, it is become like a stick.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>9</verse><span>They that be slain with the sword</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>are better than they that be slain with hunger;</span></indent><span>
  for these pine away,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>stricken through for want of the fruits of the field.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>10</verse><span>The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>11</verse><span>The LORD hath accomplished his fury;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he hath poured out his fierce anger,</span></indent><span>
  and hath kindled a fire in Zion,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and it hath devoured the foundations thereof.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>12</verse><span>The kings of the earth,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and all the inhabitants of the world,</span></indent><span>
  would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>should have entered into the gates of Jerusalem.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>13</verse><span>For the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her priests,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her,</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>14</verse><span>They have wandered as blind men in the streets,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>they have polluted themselves with blood,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>so that men could not touch their garments.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>They cried unto them, “Depart ye; it is unclean; depart, depart, touch not;”</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>when they fled away and wandered,</span></indent><span>
  they said among the heathen,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>“They shall no more sojourn there.”</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>16</verse><span>The anger of the LORD hath divided them;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he will no more regard them;</span></indent><span>
  they respected not the persons of the priests,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>they favored not the elders.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>17</verse><span>As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>in our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save us.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>18</verse><span>They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>19</verse><span>Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>they pursued us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>20</verse><span>The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD, was taken in their pits,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>of whom we said, “Under his shadow we shall live among the heathen.”</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>21</verse><span>Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>that dwellest in the land of Uz;</span></indent><span>
  the cup also shall pass through unto thee;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>22</verse><span>The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he will no more carry thee away into captivity;</span></indent><span>
  he will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>he will discover thy sins.</span></indent>

 <chapter>5

  <verse>1</verse><span>Remember, O Lord, what is come upon us;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>consider, and behold our reproach.</span></indent>
  <verse>2</verse><span>Our inheritance is turned to strangers,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>our houses to aliens.</span></indent>
  <verse>3</verse><span>We are orphans and fatherless,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>our mothers are as widows.</span></indent>
  <verse>4</verse><span>We have drunken our water for money;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>our wood is sold unto us.</span></indent>
  <verse>5</verse><span>Our necks are under persecution;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>we labor, and have no rest.</span></indent>
  <verse>6</verse><span>We have given the hand to the Egyptians and to the Assyrians,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>to be satisfied with bread.</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block>
  <verse>7</verse><span>Our fathers have sinned, and are not;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and we have borne their iniquities.</span></indent>
  <verse>8</verse><span>Servants have ruled over us;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>there is none that doth deliver us out of their hand.</span></indent>
  <verse>9</verse><span>We gat our bread with the peril of our lives,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>because of the sword of the wilderness.</span></indent>
  <verse>10</verse><span>Our skin was black like an oven,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>because of the terrible famine.</span></indent>
  <verse>11</verse><span>They ravished the women in Zion,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the maids in the cities of Judah.</span></indent>
  <verse>12</verse><span>Princes are hanged up by their hand;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the faces of elders were not honored.</span></indent>
  <verse>13</verse><span>They took the young men to grind,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the children fell under the wood.</span></indent>
  <verse>14</verse><span>The elders have ceased from the gate,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the young men from their music.</span></indent>
  <verse>15</verse><span>The joy of our heart is ceased;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>our dance is turned into mourning.</span></indent>
  <verse>16</verse><span>The crown is fallen from our head;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>woe unto us, that we have sinned!</span></indent>
  <verse>17</verse><span>For this our heart is faint;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>for these things our eyes are dim.</span></indent>
  <verse>18</verse><span>Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the foxes walk upon it.</span></indent>

  <verse>19</verse><span>Thou, O Lord, remainest forever;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>thy throne from generation to generation.</span></indent>
  <verse>20</verse><span>Wherefore dost thou forget us forever,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and forsake us so long time?</span></indent>
  <verse>21</verse><span>Turn thou us unto thee, O Lord, and we shall be turned;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>renew our days as of old.</span></indent>
  <verse>22</verse><span>But thou hast utterly rejected us;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>thou art very wroth against us.</span></indent>
