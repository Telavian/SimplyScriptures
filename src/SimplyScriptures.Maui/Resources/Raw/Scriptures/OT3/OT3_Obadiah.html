  <verse>1</verse><span>The vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning Edom:</span><break></break><span>
  We have heard a rumor from the LORD,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and an ambassador is sent among the heathen,</span></indent><span>
  “Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle.”</span><break></break>

  <verse>2</verse><span>“Behold, I have made thee small among the heathen;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>thou art greatly despised.</span></indent>
  <verse>3</verse><span>The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>whose habitation is high;</span></indent><span>
  that saith in his heart,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>‘Who shall bring me down to the ground?’</span></indent>
  <verse>4</verse><span>Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and though thou set thy nest among the stars,</span></indent>
  <indent><span>thence will I bring thee down,” saith the LORD.</span></indent>

  <verse>5</verse><span>If thieves came to thee,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>if robbers by night,</span></indent><span>
  (how art thou cut off!)</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>would they not have stolen till they had enough?</span></indent><span>
  If the grape gatherers came to thee,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>would they not leave some grapes?</span></indent>
  <verse>6</verse><span>How are the things of Esau searched out!</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>How are his hidden things sought up!</span></indent>
  <verse>7</verse><span>All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee even to the border;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee, and prevailed against thee;</span></indent><span>
  they that eat thy bread have laid a wound under thee;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>there is none understanding in him.</span></indent>

  <verse>8</verse><span>“Shall I not in that day,” saith the LORD, “even destroy the wise men out of Edom,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and understanding out of the mount of Esau?</span></indent>
  <verse>9</verse><span>And thy mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>to the end that every one of the mount of Esau may be cut off by slaughter.</span></indent>
  <verse>10</verse><span>For thy violence against thy brother Jacob shame shall cover thee,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and thou shalt be cut off forever.</span></indent>
  <verse>11</verse><span>In the day that thou stoodest on the other side,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces,</span></indent><span>
  and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>even thou wast as one of them.</span></indent>
  <verse>12</verse><span>But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>in the day that he became a stranger;</span></indent><span>
  neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>in the day of their destruction;</span></indent><span>
  neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>in the day of distress.</span></indent>
  <verse>13</verse><span>Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>in the day of their calamity;</span></indent><span>
  yea, thou shouldest not have looked on their affliction</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>in the day of their calamity,</span></indent>
 </block>

 <block><span>
  nor have laid hands on their substance</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>in the day of their calamity;</span></indent>
  <verse>14</verse><span>neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>to cut off those of his that did escape;</span></indent><span>
  neither shouldest thou have delivered up those of his that did remain</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>in the day of distress.</span></indent>

 <block>
  <verse>15</verse><span>For the day of the LORD is near</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>upon all the heathen;</span></indent><span>
  as thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>thy reward shall return upon thine own head.</span></indent>
  <verse>16</verse><span>For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>so shall all the heathen drink continually;</span></indent><span>
  yea, they shall drink, and they shall swallow down,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and they shall be as though they had not been.</span></indent>
  <verse>17</verse><span>But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and there shall be holiness;</span></indent>
  <indent><span>and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions.</span></indent>
  <verse>18</verse><span>And the house of Jacob shall be a fire,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the house of Joseph a flame,</span></indent><span>
  and the house of Esau for stubble,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and they shall kindle in them, and devour them;</span></indent><span>
  and there shall not be any remaining of the house of Esau,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>for the LORD hath spoken it.</span></indent>

  <verse>19</verse><span>And they of the south shall possess the mount of Esau;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and they of the plain, the Philistines;</span></indent><span>
  and they shall possess the fields of Ephriam, and the fields of Samaria;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and Benjamin shall possess Gilead.</span></indent>
  <verse>20</verse><span>And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>shall possess that of the Canaanites, even unto Zarephath;</span></indent><span>
  and the captivity of Jerusalem, which is in Sepharad,</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>shall possess the cities of the south.</span></indent>
  <verse>21</verse><span>And saviors shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau;</span><break></break>
  <indent><span>and the kingdom shall be the LORD’s.</span></indent>
