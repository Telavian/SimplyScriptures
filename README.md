All standard scriptural works with incorporated JST changes along with research materials

Each edition increases the readability by modernizing the page layout into paragraphs and poetic form when needed. Section headers and bullet lists are added when needed along with chapter/verse numbers indicated in a subdued form to increase readability.

The Old Testament is broken into 3 books because of the overall length of the text. JST changes are indicated with an underline. For small changes the King James Version of the text is indicated in the margin. Minimal text changes were performed to modernize the text when a direct equivalent word was available. When an equivalent word was not available then the text was left as original.

The New Testament has its JST changes indicated with an underline. For small changes the King James Version of the text is indicated in the margin. Minimal text changes were performed to modernize the text when a direct equivalent word was available. When an equivalent word was not available then the text was left as original. In some places the JST reorders verses so these are indicated inside parenthesis to indicate an out of order numerical value.

For the Book of Mormon text changes are determined from <a href="https://rsc.byu.edu/joseph-smith-prophet-man/book-mormon-critical-text-project">The Book Of Mormon Critical Text Project</a> by Royal Skousen. When the text has been changed the change is indicated as being from the original manuscript or the printers manuscript. Similar passages from the JST are also indicated.

The Doctrine and Covenenants was updated to indicate changes from the 1833 Book of Commandments compared with the 1835 Doctrine and Covenants. Changes between the 2 versions are indicated by an underline. Since the Lectures on Faith were included in the 1833 edition and were canonized as scriptures they are also included. To aid in research each section is indicated with a section number, a section topic, the date and location the section was received, along with the section number in the 1833/1835 editions, and the location in the History of the Church where the original can be found. Each of the editions along with the HoC has a direct link to very quickly assist in research. Some non canonized sources have been added to help with research and to assist with understanding the context of the other received sections.

This whole project was because of the great work from <a href="https://MeasuringDoctrine.com">Measuring Doctrine</a> and is a complete rework of that source material into a much simpler, but visually consistent form.
It is publically available, totally free, at <a href="https://simplyscriptures.com">Simply Scriptures</a> along with associated mobile apps.
