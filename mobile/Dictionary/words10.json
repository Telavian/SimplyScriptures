This sound however is not precisely that of eu or yu, except in a few words, as in unite, union, uniform; the sound does not begin with the distinct sound of e, nor end in the distinct sound of oo, unless when prolonged.  It cannot be well expressed in letters.  This sound is heard in the unaffected pronunciation of annuity, numerate, brute, mute, dispute, duke, true, truth, rule, prudence, opportunity, infusion.\nSome modern writers make a distinction between the sound of u, when it follows r, as in rude, truth, and its sound when it follows other letters, as in mute, duke; making the former sound equivalent to oo; rood, trooth; and the latter a diphthong equivalent to eu or yu.  This is a mischievous innovation, and not authorized by any general usage either in England or the United States.  The difference, very nice indeed, between the sound of u in mute, and in rude, is owing entirely to the articulation which precedes that letter.  For example,  when a labial precedes u, we enter on its sound with the lips closed, and in opening them to the position required for uttering u, there is almost necessarily a slight sound of e formed before we arrive at the proper sound of u.  When r precedes u, the mouth is open before the sound of u is commenced.  But in both cases, u is to be considered as having the same sound.\nIn some words, as in bull, full, pull, the sound of u is that of the Italian u, the French ou, but shortened.  This is a vowel.\nU has another short sound, as in tun, run, sun, turn, rub.  This also is a vowel."},{"Word":"Uberous","Definition":"U\u0027BEROUS, a.  [L. uber.]  Fruitful; copious.

[Little used.]"},{"Word":"Un","Definition":"UN,  a prefix or inseparable preposition, un or on, usually un, an, is the same word as the L. in.  It is a particle of negation, giving to words to which it is prefixed, a negative signification.  We use un or in indifferently for this purpose; and the tendency of modern usage is to prefer the use of in, in some words, where un was formerly used.  Un admits of no change of n into l, m or r, as in does, in illuminate, immense, irresolute.  It is prefixed generally to adjectives and participles, and almost at pleasure.  In a few instances, it is prefixed to verbs, as in unbend, unbind, unharness.  As the compounds formed with un are so common and so well known, the composition is not noticed under the several words.

A contest between nations or states, carried on by force, either for defense, or for revenging insults and redressing wrongs, for the extension of commerce or acquisition of territory, or for obtaining and establishing the superiority and dominion of one over the other. These objects are accomplished by the slaughter or capture of troops, and the capture and destruction of ships, towns and property. Among rude nations, war is often waged and carried on for plunder. As war is the contest of nations or states, it always implies that such contest is authorized by the monarch or the sovereign power of the nation. When war is commenced by attacking a nation in peace, it si called an offensive war, and such attack is aggressive. When war is undertaken to repel invasion or the attacks of an enemy, it is called defensive, and a defensive war is considered as justifiable. Very few of the wars that have desolated nations and deluged the earth with blood, have been justifiable. Happy would it be for mankind, if the prevalence of Christian principles might ultimately extinguish the spirit of war, and if the ambition to be great, might yield to the ambition of being good.\nPreparation for war is sometimes the best security for peace.\n2.

Wauter. [G., Gr.]\n1. A fluid, the most abundant and most necessary for living beings of any in nature, except air. Water when pure, is colorless, destitute of taste and smell, ponderous, transparent, and in a very small degree compressible. It is reposited in the earth in inexhaustible quantities, where it is preserved fresh and cool, and from which it issues in springs, which form streams and rivers. But the great reservoirs of water on the globe are the ocean, seas and lakes, which cover more than three fifths of its surface, and from which it is raised by evaporation, and uniting with the air in the state of vapor, is wafted over the earth, ready to be precipitated in the form of rain, snow or hail.\nWater by the abstraction or loss of heat becomes solid, or in other words, is converted into ice or snow; and by heat it is converted into steam, an elastic vapor, one of the most powerful agents in nature. Modern chemical experiments prove that water is a compound substance, consisting of a combination of oxygen and hydrogen gases, or rather the bases or ponderable matter of those gases; or about two volumes or measures of hydrogen gas and one of oxygen gas. The proportion of the ingredients in weight, is nearly 85 parts of oxygen to 15 of hydrogen.\n2.

[See the Verb.]\n1. That faculty of the mind by which we determine either to do or forbear an action; the faculty which is exercised in deciding, among two or more objects, which we shall embrace or pursue. The will is directed or influenced by the judgment. The understanding or reason compares different objects, which operate as motives; the judgment determines which is preferable, and the will decides which to pursue. In other words, we reason with respect to the value or importance of things; we then judge which is to be preferred; and we will to take the most valuable.  These are but different operations of the mind, soul, or intellectual part of man. Great disputes have existed respecting the freedom of the will.  Will is often quite a different thing from desire.\nA power over a mans subsistence, amounts to a power over his will.\n2. Choice; determination. It is my will to prosecute the trespasser.\n3.
